# State Dept officials hold briefing amid talks of potential hostage release deal in Israel
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I)
*  So it was just a tease? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=0.0s)]
*  You didn't have anything to say? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1.84s)]
*  It was just a tease. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2.84s)]
*  I'm here for your questions. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=3.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=4.84s)]
*  Well, tell us what the latest – your latest understanding is of the – this alleged deal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=5.84s)]
*  With respect to hostages, so what I will say is that we are very close to an agreement, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=15.24s)]
*  but we are not there yet. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=20.04s)]
*  As you have heard us say a number of times over the course of the past few weeks, nothing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=21.52s)]
*  is final until everything is final. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=25.52s)]
*  At this point, everything is not yet final, but we are close. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=28.24s)]
*  The Israeli cabinet is meeting to discuss this matter right now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=33.4s)]
*  We are in close conversation with them, as we are with the government of Qatar, who has [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=36.7s)]
*  been helping facilitate discussions for the – since the early days of the crisis. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  We are hopeful to have some good news for the hostages and their families. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=45.44s)]
*  We are hopeful we can start bringing some of them home, but as I said at the outset, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=49.08s)]
*  we are not quite there yet. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=52.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=54.28s)]
*  Well, so when you made reference to the Israeli cabinet meeting right now, is that the last [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=55.28s)]
*  thing that needs to be done? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=63.44s)]
*  I really don't want to get into the underlying details. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=65.64s)]
*  Obviously, the Israeli government discussing and coming to some sort of resolution is one [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=68.8s)]
*  part of this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=73.36s)]
*  There are others. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=74.36s)]
*  I don't want to get into the full details. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=75.36s)]
*  I will say that, of course, the implementation and execution of an agreement, should one [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=77.44s)]
*  be reached, requires the cooperation of Hamas, a terrorist organization. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  So it's why we're always hesitant to say too much about what will happen before it [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=87.96s)]
*  has happened, but we are close to an agreement and hopeful one can be reached. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=93.68s)]
*  Jen. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=99.28s)]
*  Is your understanding that the first tranche of hostages to be released would include Americans? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=100.28s)]
*  I just can't get into any type of details about what an agreement would look like, including [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=104.08s)]
*  who would be released if such an agreement was finalized. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=109.68s)]
*  And have you received any updates on their conditions, whereabouts, if they're being [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  held together, if they are all in fact being held by Hamas? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=115.72s)]
*  Again, I can't get into too much into the underlying details. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=119.4s)]
*  It has always been our assessment that Hamas may not have control of all of these hostages, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  but beyond that, I just don't want to speak to any specific details. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=129.56s)]
*  Barbara? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=133.88s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=134.88s)]
*  Sorry, I'm sorry. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=135.88s)]
*  Is it your understanding that if and when a deal is reached, that would then trigger [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=136.88s)]
*  more aid being able to get into Gaza, as the Secretary had suggested would happen? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=140.2s)]
*  Let me say a couple things about that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=146.6s)]
*  One, it has always been the position of the United States that we do not need a hostage [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=148.16s)]
*  deal to get more aid in, that more fuel, more food, more water, more medicine should not [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=152.88s)]
*  be contingent on a hostage agreement being reached. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  We thought that the delivery of humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people was [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=163.8s)]
*  important in its own right, and that's why the Secretary has been pushing for it, it's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=167.04s)]
*  why the President has been pushing for it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=170.24s)]
*  It's what our Ambassador David Satterfield, or special envoy, I should say, Ambassador [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=172.08s)]
*  David Satterfield, has been working to implement on the ground. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=176.12s)]
*  That said, it has been clear that for some time that an agreement on hostages would release [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=179.36s)]
*  or would unlock the potential for delivery of more humanitarian assistance, so we're [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=187.76s)]
*  hopeful that that would take place. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=191.4s)]
*  But again, it has always been our position that the two don't need to be linked, that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=192.6s)]
*  humanitarian assistance should be delivered as quickly as possible for the benefit of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=196.0s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=199.92s)]
*  But the Israelis seem to have linked it, it seems. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=200.92s)]
*  It does seem that – the way I would say it is it does appear that any kind of hostage [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=203.2s)]
*  agreement, should we reach one, would unlock more humanitarian assistance flowing in. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=208.16s)]
*  Barbara. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  It was actually – that was similar to my question, but on the understanding that that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  is what you're hoping for, have you made extra preparations? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=219.0s)]
*  I mean, are you poised to move quickly, to get more aid in? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=222.48s)]
*  Like, what's the activity around that? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  We have been working to – not just related to any hostage arrangement, we have been working [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=230.76s)]
*  independent of that to facilitate the delivery of more humanitarian assistance in. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  And so you have seen U.S. aid fly more humanitarian assistance into Egypt to have it pre-positioned, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=240.04s)]
*  so it could go into Gaza. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=245.6s)]
*  Some of that aid has started to move. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  We have been working with other international donors to facilitate the delivery of aid to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=248.72s)]
*  Egypt to go in through Ra'afah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  And then, of course, there's a screening process that has been a bit of an impediment [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  to the fast delivery of aid. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  And we have been working with the government of Israel, with the government of Egypt, on [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=260.28s)]
*  all of these matters to try to increase the flow of humanitarian assistance. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=263.28s)]
*  You saw a breakthrough last week, an initial breakthrough, when we saw an agreement to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=268.48s)]
*  deliver fuel in, which of course is important to ensure that water can be desalinated. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=271.68s)]
*  It's important to ensure that there's electricity for hospitals. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=276.88s)]
*  It's important to ensure that the implementers, the organizations that actually deliver the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=280.08s)]
*  humanitarian assistance inside Gaza, once it goes through Ra'afah into Gaza, that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=285.44s)]
*  they can deliver it to the people who need it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  So we have been pushing all those things independent of any potential hostage arrangement, and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=292.2s)]
*  we'll continue to do so. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=297.4s)]
*  Just to follow up, so you mentioned the issue about the screening and trying to get more [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=298.4s)]
*  facilities or people in place to do more screening, which would then help more aid. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=303.92s)]
*  If there is a humanitarian, long humanitarian pause in exchange for hostages, although you're [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=308.0s)]
*  not linking aid to hostages, but whatever, if there is a time period, does that mean [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=317.36s)]
*  you wouldn't necessarily get a lot more aid in if you're still dealing with these [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=322.24s)]
*  issues like screening and so on? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=325.68s)]
*  How much of a – how much do you think it could boost aid if there was four days of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=327.24s)]
*  aid? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=331.72s)]
*  I think we're getting into the realm I'm not comfortable. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=332.8s)]
*  I'll talk a little bit about what we have done and what we're trying to do, but when [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=335.68s)]
*  we start getting too far into what could happen as a potential result of a deal that has not [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=339.48s)]
*  yet been reached, I think I'm going to decline to comment in too much detail. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=344.44000000000005s)]
*  Just one last question. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=348.36s)]
*  The Israelis beginning their southern offensive and you talked about wanting to make sure [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  there's better arrangements in place for protection of civilians. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=358.32s)]
*  Have you been asking them to delay their southern offensive until that's ready? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=363.08s)]
*  I mean, they've already kind of started anyway, but where are things at? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=367.64s)]
*  So I won't get into too much detail about the private conversations that happened between [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=371.44s)]
*  our two governments, but we have made clear to them, as we have made clear publicly, that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=375.28s)]
*  we think they should not commence with further activities in the south until they have taken [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=380.03999999999996s)]
*  the proper steps to account for the humanitarian needs there. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=386.44s)]
*  There are a number – several hundred thousand people who have moved from the north to the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=389.0s)]
*  south before any military offensive begins there. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=392.24s)]
*  We would want to ensure that those people are properly protected. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=395.52s)]
*  Said, go ahead. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=398.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=400.56s)]
*  I just want to follow up on a couple of things that Barbara raised, but before that I want [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=401.56s)]
*  to state for the record that the poet, Mas'ab Abdu'l-Tawah, whom I raised yesterday, he [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=405.08s)]
*  was actually released today by the Israelis, and I like to think that you guys had something [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=411.6s)]
*  to do with that, and he will be on his way to Egypt so he can come back to the United [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=416.24s)]
*  States with his family. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=420.44s)]
*  On the issue of the deal itself, we're talking about – [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=423.08s)]
*  The issue of what itself? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=427.88s)]
*  The potential deal. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=428.88s)]
*  Oh, the deal, the deal, yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=429.88s)]
*  The potential deal that could or may not happen. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=430.88s)]
*  Is it your understanding that there is a split in the Israeli cabinet as to who may agree [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=436.08s)]
*  and will that hold the going forward with the deal? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=443.76s)]
*  I'm just not going to discuss internal Israeli political matters. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=447.88s)]
*  Right, but let's say – I mean, if the war cabinet agrees and the larger cabinet [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=451.88s)]
*  does not agree or the Supreme Court and so on, then we're back to square one. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=457.36s)]
*  Are you urging the Israelis to go forward with the deal? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=460.88s)]
*  I'm not going to discuss our private conversations with the Israeli government, but we have been [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=464.56s)]
*  attempting to reach an agreement to secure the release of hostages for some time, and [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=468.76s)]
*  I'll leave it at that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=473.32s)]
*  Let me just ask you on something that you always state, that you want the Israelis to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=474.32s)]
*  abide by the laws of war. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=480.8s)]
*  You want to minimize civilian casualties among Palestinians and so on. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=482.52s)]
*  Yesterday or the day before was Children's World Day, whatever. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=487.48s)]
*  Fifty-five hundred Palestinian children have died thus far. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=494.04s)]
*  Do you think the Israelis are abiding by the laws of war? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=497.6s)]
*  So I will say that it is a tragedy how many people have died in Gaza. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  It's a tragedy how many children have died, especially. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=506.88s)]
*  As the Secretary has said, it is our belief that far too many Palestinian civilians have [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=511.20000000000005s)]
*  been killed as a result of this conflict. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=516.0400000000001s)]
*  We continue to engage with the government of Israel about steps we believe they should [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=519.76s)]
*  take to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=524.48s)]
*  It is an ongoing conversation between our two governments, and we continue to engage [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=526.6s)]
*  with them on every possible measure they can take to ensure that civilians are not in harm's [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=531.72s)]
*  way as they conduct legitimate military operations. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=537.84s)]
*  And I do want to remind everyone again that the reason why this is so difficult, difficult [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=541.12s)]
*  even in most conflicts, is because Hamas embeds itself inside civilian targets. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=547.44s)]
*  And so Israel faces this difficult situation where there are legitimate military targets, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=554.52s)]
*  terrorists who launch an attack against the Israeli public and who have said they want [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=561.36s)]
*  to continue launching terrorist attacks against the Israeli public and in fact continue to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=564.6s)]
*  launch rockets even in the past few days against the Israeli public. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=568.4s)]
*  And Israel has a right and obligation to take military action to try to bring those terrorists [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=571.88s)]
*  to justice, but their burden is in no way lessened to minimize civilian harm. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=576.6s)]
*  And so that is what we continue to emphasize to them in all of our conversations with them, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=582.2s)]
*  including concrete steps about how they can do that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=585.2s)]
*  And on that very point now, the Israelis seem to be obsessed with the Palestinian hospitals. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=587.88s)]
*  I wonder if you have seen the interview done on CNN with the former Israeli Prime Minister [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=593.0s)]
*  Yehud Barak who acknowledged that it was actually Israel that built these basements or tunnels [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=599.44s)]
*  and so on. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=606.2s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=607.2s)]
*  I saw a report of the interview. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=608.2s)]
*  I haven't seen the full interview and I don't have any independent assessment about that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=609.2s)]
*  I would say regardless of where, what particular tunnel he might be speaking to or what's [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=613.12s)]
*  it said, if there are Hamas, the issue of Hamas embedding itself under a hospital would [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=618.72s)]
*  be a different matter. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=624.84s)]
*  Obviously, I mean, they really showed no proof, but he was saying what he was suggesting that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=625.84s)]
*  these whatever caverns or whatever you want to call them underneath the hospital, they [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=630.9200000000001s)]
*  actually were there for utilitarian purposes. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=635.9200000000001s)]
*  So what I will say about that is number one, we have, we've assessed, but it's public [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=638.68s)]
*  knowledge at this point shown over many years that Hamas has also built its own tunnels [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=647.4s)]
*  regardless of what, regardless of that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=653.0s)]
*  Number two, whatever infrastructure exists at a hospital, under a hospital, no matter [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  who put it there, terrorists should not be using that infrastructure to embed themselves [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=660.68s)]
*  target, underneath a civilian hospital, underneath a hospital that is supposed to exist for the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=666.56s)]
*  care of civilians and making that, using that facility as a human shield. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=672.3599999999999s)]
*  So it is, I think, a separate issue than who might have built whatever room it is the former [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  prime minister was referring to. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=682.56s)]
*  Humira. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=684.1199999999999s)]
*  Matt, just to follow up on a couple of things from colleagues' questions. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=685.1199999999999s)]
*  So this might be a little bit down the line, but is there at all an understanding in these [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=690.56s)]
*  hostage negotiations for what comes next after this deal? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=697.04s)]
*  And I'm asking because there are 240 people who are taken hostage by Hamas. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=701.56s)]
*  So while Israel, Hamas, Qatar, and you were in, somehow in these conversations about this [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=708.8399999999999s)]
*  number of people, was there any understanding for what happens with the rest of the people? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=717.64s)]
*  So I do appreciate the question, but if I'm going to decline to comment on an arrangement [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=726.16s)]
*  that has not yet been finalized, not yet been reached, I certainly don't think I can comment [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  on what might come next after this arrangement. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=737.2399999999999s)]
*  I would just say, reiterate that, again, we're close to a deal. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  We don't have one yet. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=747.12s)]
*  I can't talk about what might be in a potential deal, let alone what might come in its aftermath. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=748.76s)]
*  But surely you're talking for everybody. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=753.88s)]
*  It has been our goal from the beginning to secure the release of every single hostage. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  The United States is focused on American citizens, of course, but we're focused on all the hostages. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=760.6s)]
*  We want to see all the hostages released. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=765.68s)]
*  We don't think any of them should be held. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  That has been the goal of our negotiations from the outset, but I can't get into what [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=769.48s)]
*  any steps might look like. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=774.9200000000001s)]
*  And just to push you a little bit more on Barbara's question about possible Israeli offensive [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=775.9200000000001s)]
*  in the South, John Feiner also talked about this as well. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=781.24s)]
*  But what is the very latest in the sense that – are you getting a timeline from them on [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=785.7600000000001s)]
*  when they are planning to start this? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=792.64s)]
*  And are you telling them specifically, here are the things, here are the objectives, here [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=797.24s)]
*  are the safe zones you have to create, or whatever you think appropriate to call them [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=802.68s)]
*  before you start this? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=806.96s)]
*  And without these, you should not be starting this. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=808.28s)]
*  Is that clear cut? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=810.68s)]
*  So we are having fairly detailed conversations with them about steps that they could take [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=812.12s)]
*  to protect civilians and steps that they could take to increase humanitarian access, increase [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=818.2s)]
*  humanitarian protections, especially in the South. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=822.2s)]
*  I don't want to get into the details of those conversations. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=824.52s)]
*  Obviously, the Israeli government makes its own decisions about its military campaigns. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=827.36s)]
*  The conversations that we have been having with them are on steps that they can take [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=831.76s)]
*  as they look to the South to increase protections for civilians, especially considering that [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=835.92s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of civilians, after being told to move by the Israeli government, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=841.64s)]
*  move from the North to the South, we think it's important that those civilians now [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=845.96s)]
*  have a way to put themselves out of harm's way. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=849.5200000000001s)]
*  And in terms of the protections for civilians, is it United States government's proposal, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=852.5200000000001s)]
*  and does it include ICRC or UN for the creation of those safe zones? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=858.8000000000001s)]
*  Like whose proposal is it and what does it look like? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=865.96s)]
*  So we have been in conversation not just with the government of Israel, but with a range [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=868.4000000000001s)]
*  of humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations, about how exactly civilian [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=872.5200000000001s)]
*  protections could be implemented, how they can best be implemented. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=878.44s)]
*  But I think it's best that while those conversations are ongoing, I keep the details of them confidential. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=881.44s)]
*  Do you have like a target in mind? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=885.6400000000001s)]
*  Like we're looking to conclude those conversations and have some sort of a rough plan by the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=888.08s)]
*  end of the week, soon? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=893.2800000000001s)]
*  I just wouldn't want to put a timeline on it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=894.2800000000001s)]
*  One more. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=897.2800000000001s)]
*  There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy between U.S. and UN on the opening of Karam Shalom. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=898.2800000000001s)]
*  I've read the transcript from yesterday. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=904.6800000000001s)]
*  You guys don't seem to be focusing on trying to get that one open. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=908.32s)]
*  Do you think RAFA has the capacity to process more aid? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=911.5600000000001s)]
*  But UN Martin Griffiths seems to disagree a little bit, and they are imploring Israel [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=917.4000000000001s)]
*  to allow humanitarian aid via Karam Shalom. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=924.6400000000001s)]
*  Why is it a discrepancy? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=928.12s)]
*  So there may be a little bit of apples and oranges here. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=929.12s)]
*  In terms of addressing your question, we don't think that there is a problem with the ability [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=932.6s)]
*  for RAFA to handle more traffic in terms of the number of trucks that can just physically [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=939.88s)]
*  go through it carrying humanitarian. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=943.76s)]
*  RAFA is big enough to handle that. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=945.24s)]
*  It's big enough to allow the delivery of a massive amount of humanitarian assistance. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=946.6s)]
*  There has been an issue with screening. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=950.9200000000001s)]
*  I think Jen was alluding to it in her question earlier. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=952.6800000000001s)]
*  And we have been in conversation with the government of Israel about additional ways [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=956.64s)]
*  to get additional screening for trucks that would then go in through RAFA. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=959.6s)]
*  But no, I'm coming. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=963.0400000000001s)]
*  The government of Israel has very real concerns about security at Karam Shalom. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=966.6s)]
*  You can understand why. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=971.48s)]
*  One side of that border is obviously Gaza, in areas of Gaza that are still controlled [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=972.52s)]
*  by Hamas, that are not controlled by the government of Israel. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=978.36s)]
*  We continue to have conversations with Israel about the best way to increase the amount [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=982.16s)]
*  of screening so trucks can get screened and then get in through RAFA. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=986.24s)]
*  But they do have very real concerns about opening Karam Shalom, and that's why you've [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=989.6s)]
*  seen them not take that step as of yet. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=993.52s)]
*  Final thing, because Griffiths is actually giving a percentage saying Karam Shalom crossing [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=995.0s)]
*  used to – was used to carry more than 60 percent of the truckloads going into Gaza [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=999.64s)]
*  before the conflict. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1003.64s)]
*  But I understand and I'm aware of the sort of screening-related backlog. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1004.92s)]
*  U.S. is not pursuing this actively with the Israelis is what I'm understanding from [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1009.96s)]
*  you. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1016.24s)]
*  You're opening that. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1017.24s)]
*  What – the point I'm making is that we think RAFA is sufficient for the delivery [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1018.24s)]
*  of humanitarian assistance. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1022.4s)]
*  That is a separate question from screening. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1023.68s)]
*  We want to try to get screening back online and open, but we think RAFA gate at this point [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1025.28s)]
*  is the appropriate way to get assistance in. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1030.76s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Matt. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1033.1599999999999s)]
*  Correspondent Farah Ammar, she was colleague as well, and cameraman Rabih Ammar were killed [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  by an Israeli attack south of Lebanon. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1039.08s)]
*  There was a direct attack because it was carried by a drone. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1042.9199999999998s)]
*  And drone, you know, you have a camera, you can see who's on the ground. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1045.72s)]

*  While there was a comment from the manager of the Mayadeen channel, who happened to be [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1054.4399999999998s)]
*  their boss, that Israeli government decision this month to block access to channel's [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1060.6799999999998s)]
*  website and this attack targeted them. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1065.1999999999998s)]
*  Last week, almost my colleague, Nakhli Adhaimi, could have killed as well. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1068.1999999999998s)]
*  The missile passed by him and there was a convoy of different stations, Al Jazeera, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1072.36s)]
*  Al Arabiya, all kind of stations, Washington Post, and Beirut. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1077.2399999999998s)]
*  They were checking some of the areas, a tour by the UN. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1080.52s)]
*  So how Israel is obeying the rule of law if it's attacking directly journalists to punish [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1085.36s)]
*  them or silence them? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1091.28s)]
*  And no offense. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1093.4399999999998s)]
*  Israel has an extension, a huge history of killing civilians directly. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1095.6s)]
*  So again, I can never, I'm never in a position from here to speak to any particular strike [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1100.32s)]
*  or any particular military action when the entire facts are not known to me, are not [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1105.84s)]

*  Government, including what information the governor of Israel had, what might have gone [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1111.4399999999998s)]
*  into a decision, whether there was a mistake or not. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1114.8799999999999s)]
*  It's impossible for me to speak to the merits of any individual strike that has been true [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1117.3999999999999s)]
*  not just with respect to this one, but with respect to others. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1121.32s)]
*  I will say that we are concerned by the reports that civilians, including two journalists, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1124.44s)]
*  were killed in Lebanon. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1129.04s)]
*  Our thoughts are with the loved ones of those killed and all these Lebanese people. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1130.88s)]
*  If you were here yesterday, you heard me speak to our belief in the importance that journalists [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1135.92s)]
*  play in conflict zones. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1139.64s)]
*  Journalists are fundamental to a free society. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1141.8400000000001s)]
*  We stand with the journalists around the world who do critical work that we rely on every [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1144.3600000000001s)]
*  day. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1148.76s)]
*  We rely on the reports of journalists here in the United States Government. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1149.76s)]
*  We know people all around the world do, and they do that in some of the most dangerous [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1152.76s)]
*  conditions imaginable. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1156.16s)]
*  I will also say that we are concerned over the escalation of violence along the blue [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1157.84s)]
*  line. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1161.84s)]
*  We have made clear we don't want to see the conflict in Gaza spread to Lebanon. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1162.84s)]
*  That has been one of our top priorities and one of the top objectives we've tried to [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1166.24s)]
*  achieve since the outset of this conflict. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1170.04s)]
*  Restoring calm among the blue line is of the utmost importance to us, and it should be [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1173.12s)]
*  a top priority for both Israel and Lebanon. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1177.56s)]
*  There was also an attack on a church yesterday. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1179.8799999999999s)]
*  And I'm not sure if you know the nature of south of Lebanon. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1182.6s)]
*  Christian villages don't have any existence of Hezbollah. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1186.04s)]
*  So we can say, like, Hamas, they were attacking or throwing missiles next to a hospital or [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1189.08s)]
*  a mosque. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1194.56s)]
*  In Lebanon, Christian villages don't have any presence of Hezbollah. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1195.56s)]
*  What was the target inside that church? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1200.48s)]
*  Who was holding accountability? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1202.12s)]
*  I know you're putting so much pressure on Israeli government. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1203.12s)]
*  I understand, but when you asked me that type of question, it was not an action carried [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1206.52s)]
*  out by the United States government. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1209.8s)]
*  It's not a question I can answer, and I'm not able to offer an assessment about an individual [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1210.8s)]
*  strike. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1214.52s)]
*  You are supplying Israel over $14 billion of military aid. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1215.52s)]
*  But when it comes to a specific strike where it's not an action that's taken by the United [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1219.32s)]
*  States government and I don't have all the available information, it's not something [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1223.6s)]
*  I can offer an assessment on. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1226.7199999999998s)]
*  Why the feeling in the Middle East that anything happened with – okay, everybody is – as [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1227.7199999999998s)]
*  a human, as any person, we'll condemn any action against humans that will happen October [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1235.56s)]
*  7. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1240.3999999999999s)]
*  Why there's a feeling in the Middle East, in every country now, that the U.S., whatever [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1241.3999999999999s)]
*  happens in Israel, it's a big deal, but the life of Palestinians or other people, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1245.28s)]
*  it's no deal. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1250.24s)]
*  It's nothing. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1251.24s)]
*  I'm telling you what, what's the feeling in that? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1252.24s)]
*  And you can do it. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1253.24s)]
*  It's your duty, and you can have the same feeling. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1254.24s)]
*  Let me just answer the question. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1255.24s)]
*  I think the Secretary has been very clear about this exact question, that far too many [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1256.24s)]
*  Palestinians have been killed. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1259.6s)]
*  He's spoken to this directly. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1261.28s)]
*  He's spoken to how, as a father, when he sees, especially the bodies of deceased children, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1263.32s)]
*  how it affects him. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1269.84s)]
*  And I can tell you that's true for everyone inside the United States government. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1270.84s)]
*  And it is precisely why we do engage with the Israeli government to impress upon them [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1274.52s)]
*  the need to take all possible steps to minimize civilian harm. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1279.08s)]
*  So I hear this sometimes, and I can tell you, these are conversations that we have at the [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1284.64s)]
*  highest levels of our government. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1288.4s)]
*  These are very intense conversations about steps that we believe Israel should take, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1291.02s)]
*  as well as the steps that we believe they should take to keep civilians out of harm's [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1294.9s)]
*  way, to help civilians move to places where they'll be safe from harm so they won't [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1299.1s)]
*  be injured from this ongoing military conflict, as well as the steps that we think are important [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1302.66s)]
*  that we have pushed for and in many cases secured to get humanitarian assistance in [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1307.22s)]
*  to the Palestinian people. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1312.46s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1313.46s)]
*  I want to go back to Gaza and the ongoing – the reports of ongoing and circulation [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1314.46s)]
*  of the Indonesian hospital in north – Indonesian hospital in north in Gaza, and there's also [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1319.98s)]
*  reports of some killed and injured during some Israeli military attack on the hospital. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1325.98s)]
*  What is the reason of attacking this hospital in your perspective? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1332.8200000000002s)]
*  Again, so I would say I'm not able to assess the merits, the individual facts or circumstances [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1337.7s)]
*  surrounding any individual strike. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1345.5800000000002s)]
*  I think all of you that have covered wars in the past know about conflicting information [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1348.18s)]
*  that emerges and accounts that change over time. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1352.22s)]
*  It's difficult for anyone to make an assessment about what happened and the reason for it [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1355.26s)]
*  happened and certainly we don't have all the facts – or I don't have all the facts [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1359.94s)]
*  here at this podium to speak to them. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1362.86s)]
*  I will say as a principal, we do not want to see hospitals struck from the air. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1364.3s)]
*  We want to see hospitals protected. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1369.1s)]
*  Hospitals provide critical services to the civilian population in Gaza and we want to [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1371.18s)]
*  see the government of Israel take steps to minimize harm to civilians and of course that [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1376.26s)]
*  includes at hospitals where civilians are seeking much needed medical care. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1380.5800000000002s)]
*  But I'm not talking about the merit from the Israeli point of view. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1384.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, for that, Al-Shifa, for example, you had an assessment that Al-Shifa is used by [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1388.98s)]
*  Hamas either as a headquarter or a command center. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1393.66s)]
*  Do you have any assessment that Hamas is using the Indonesian hospital as a command center? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1397.5800000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to speak to intelligence assessments. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1403.38s)]
*  Aside from the very limited information that we have already downgraded and made public, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1405.86s)]
*  we do see unfortunately that Hamas uses not just hospitals but mosques and schools and [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1412.6599999999999s)]
*  other places of other pieces of civilian infrastructure as places where they can embed their fighters, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1417.4199999999998s)]
*  as places that they can use to launch attacks and places where they can use civilians as [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1423.1s)]
*  human shields. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1427.6599999999999s)]
*  So as I said a minute ago and answered another question, it puts the Israeli government in [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1428.6599999999999s)]
*  a very difficult position where they are trying to defeat legitimate military or try to accomplish [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1432.82s)]
*  legitimate military objectives. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1438.02s)]
*  But sometimes when the terrorists they are trying to go after have hidden themselves [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1439.58s)]
*  in hospitals and schools and mosques. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1444.1799999999998s)]
*  So it is a difficult problem but it doesn't lessen their responsibility which is why we [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1446.62s)]
*  continue to engage in these conversations with them about taking every possible step [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1450.62s)]
*  they can to minimize civilian harm. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1454.1799999999998s)]
*  I will say with respect to Al-Shifa, we were very clear. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1456.62s)]
*  We did not want to see Al-Shifa struck from the air. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1459.6599999999999s)]
*  We did not want to see fighting going on inside the hospital. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1461.66s)]
*  We wanted to see civilians protected. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1464.14s)]
*  And I think when Israel did launch their military operation at Al-Shifa, you saw them do it [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1466.5s)]
*  in a much more careful way where they went into the hospital in a way where they were [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1475.02s)]
*  trying to protect patients and where they were trying to evacuate patients. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1478.46s)]
*  Before they went in, they offered to help facilitate or to allow third party relief [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1484.3400000000001s)]
*  to facilitate the evacuation of that hospital. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1489.86s)]
*  Hamas said no. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1492.22s)]
*  Hamas wouldn't allow it. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1493.22s)]
*  So there is always more that Israel can do to take steps to minimize civilian harm and [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1494.86s)]
*  we will continue to encourage them to do that. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1499.26s)]
*  But again, as long as Hamas continues to embed itself inside the civilian population, we [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1503.02s)]
*  are going to see this difficult challenge over and over again. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1509.1s)]
*  Yeah, Michel. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1512.94s)]
*  Will the Secretary receive the Arab ministerial delegation that visited China and how do you [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1514.74s)]
*  view their visit to China first? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1522.18s)]
*  I don't have any scheduling announcements to make, but certainly a number of the ministers [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1524.14s)]
*  who made that trip to China are people who he's met with repeatedly in the past few [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1529.64s)]
*  weeks and people he's had conversations with by phone repeatedly. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1533.66s)]
*  So we will continue to engage with a number of those individuals, whether it be here, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1537.38s)]
*  whether it be in the region. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1541.94s)]
*  I think you can anticipate that the Secretary is not done traveling to the region, and [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1543.62s)]
*  of course we – I will mention that we met with the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1547.4199999999998s)]
*  the foreign minister of Egypt, both of whom were part of this delegation in New York last [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1552.34s)]
*  month. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1556.3799999999999s)]
*  So we will continue to meet with them. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1557.3799999999999s)]
*  Whether it's here or there, I don't have an announcement to make at this time. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1558.3799999999999s)]
*  The UN has asked all the countries who are providing Israel with arms to stop providing [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1560.82s)]
*  them with the – with ammunition and arms. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1568.2199999999998s)]
*  Is the U.S. ready to do so? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1572.54s)]
*  No, that is not a step we're ready to take. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1573.54s)]
*  In fact, we have a supplemental request pending before Congress that we hope Congress will [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1576.98s)]
*  act on expeditiously, which provides additional assistance to Israel as well as additional [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1581.22s)]
*  assistance to Ukraine. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1587.34s)]
*  And finally, do you have any update on the talks and discussions that you are doing with [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1589.34s)]
*  partners and allies regarding the ship that Houthi's seized? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1596.02s)]
*  No, I do not. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1601.38s)]
*  It's a – continues to be an ongoing matter of diplomatic discussion. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1603.3s)]
*  Alex, go ahead. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1607.14s)]
*  Thank you, Matt. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1608.14s)]
*  A couple of things. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1609.14s)]
*  But before the potential deal, I understand you don't want to get into details about [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1610.14s)]
*  the potential deal. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1613.14s)]
*  About what? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1614.14s)]
*  No. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1615.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1616.14s)]
*  How confident are you that there will be well-established international mechanism to ensure that all [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1617.14s)]
*  the sides are holding promises? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1619.54s)]
*  I'm not going to talk at all about any of the details of a potential deal, which that [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1621.6200000000001s)]
*  obviously would be when one has not yet been reached. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1626.78s)]
*  What was your level of concern that potentially might be jeopardized by other actors like Iran? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1630.1s)]
*  Again, let's – I know, but like any questions about a potential deal, maybe let's wait [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1636.86s)]
*  until we actually have a deal and then we can talk about it. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1642.06s)]
*  But when it's still a potential deal, I think I'll decline to comment. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1644.82s)]
*  You might also say that it's concerned that Wagner is potentially preparing to send new [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1647.6599999999999s)]
*  equipment to Hezbollah or Iran. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1654.26s)]
*  First of all, what do you know and what can you do to prevent this from happening? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1657.46s)]
*  And also, in terms of deal, how much do you think this might jeopardize? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1662.06s)]
*  So it is a concern that we have. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1667.26s)]
*  The White House spoke to this earlier today. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1669.26s)]
*  I don't have any kind of detail to add to that. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1670.66s)]
*  But to the question, third time you tried to ask me, I'm just not going to comment [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1673.38s)]
*  at all on a potential deal and what implication anything might have or might not have on it. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1676.66s)]
*  As for Wagner itself, as you know, this is international – the U.S. recognizes it as [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1682.26s)]
*  an international criminal organization. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1686.26s)]
*  Where do you draw the line, red line, in terms of switching from international criminal organization [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1687.6599999999999s)]
*  to recognizing it as an international terrorist organization? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1692.86s)]
*  So this is a conversation that you and I have had many times. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1696.26s)]
*  I don't have a different answer for you than I have had – than I've had the previous [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1699.06s)]
*  – a new angle, it's the same question. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1702.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't have a different answer the previous seven or eight times I've answered it, which [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1704.06s)]
*  we have taken a number of steps to hold Wagner accountable, including the designated – you [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1708.46s)]
*  mentioned including multiple sanctions for its activities in Ukraine, its activities [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1713.46s)]
*  in Africa, and we will continue to do so. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1717.86s)]
*  Please come back to what you created as a pranaytik. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1720.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1722.06s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1722.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1723.26s)]
*  I just wanted to follow up on the exchange in this room yesterday about the feature of [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1724.06s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1728.06s)]
*  You said there may need to be some transition period in Gaza. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1728.66s)]
*  Can you clarify what do you mean by a transition period? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1734.46s)]
*  And who will govern Gaza during this transition period? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1737.86s)]
*  Again, we're getting a little – this is a little cart before the horse, as some of [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1741.6599999999999s)]
*  the questions about hostages have been. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1748.26s)]
*  What I meant with respect to transition – a transition period is something the Secretary [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1751.06s)]
*  has spoken to. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1754.6599999999999s)]
*  First, let me back up and say that we have outlined some clear principles that we believe [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1756.4599999999998s)]
*  the future status of Gaza when this conflict is over. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1762.66s)]
*  We've been through those principles. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1767.8600000000001s)]
*  No reoccupation of Gaza, no control of Gaza by Hamas, no diminution in the territorial [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1769.46s)]
*  size of Gaza, no siege of Gaza. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1776.66s)]
*  That said, Israel is conducting a military operation. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1781.26s)]
*  At some point, that military operation will end. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1784.8600000000001s)]
*  There will have to be a transition period before the next status emerges. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1788.06s)]
*  Before – we've talked about what we want to see as the Palestinian Authority ultimately [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1797.6599999999999s)]
*  governing both Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1804.06s)]
*  There has to be some security force in place for a transition period. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1807.86s)]
*  You can't just see the Israeli government complete its security operations and then [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1811.26s)]
*  and leave Gaza in a security and political vacuum immediately. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1817.4599999999998s)]
*  There will have to be some transition period. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1820.6599999999999s)]
*  What that transition period looks like, I think it's too early to say. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1823.06s)]
*  We're engaged in those conversations with allies and partners right now. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1825.6599999999999s)]
*  We'll continue to look for the best solution possible with one of our first principles [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1829.6599999999999s)]
*  being that the Palestinian people themselves need to be front and center in deciding the [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1837.86s)]
*  future governance of Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1842.06s)]
*  But I think as we are in the ongoing military campaign in Gaza, it's a little too early [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1845.66s)]
*  to talk about what those details might look like. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1851.8600000000001s)]
*  So you stated the U.S. position, but it seems that the U.S. and Israel have different visions [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1853.8600000000001s)]
*  for a post for Gaza. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1861.26s)]
*  Secretary Billington said Gaza should be unified with the West Bank under the PA, but Netanyahu [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1863.26s)]
*  made it clear during this CNN interview that he would not be handing over Gaza's control [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1873.66s)]
*  to the PA. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1879.8600000000001s)]
*  There are also other issues that it seems that you don't agree on. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1880.8600000000001s)]
*  So how will you address this gap between you and the Netanyahu government? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1885.3600000000001s)]
*  That is what diplomacy is for. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1890.8600000000001s)]
*  We have laid out our principles and you will see us engage with the government of Israel [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1892.96s)]
*  as well as other governments in the region to advance our principles as well as engage [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1896.66s)]
*  with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people directly to talk about what the future [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1902.66s)]
*  of Gaza looks like at the end of this conflict. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1908.26s)]
*  Thank you, Mark. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1910.26s)]
*  Going back to the deal, you said that you're close to that deal. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1911.26s)]
*  How close you are and then do you expect to be announced? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1915.26s)]
*  I don't even know how to answer that question. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1917.26s)]
*  I think I said we're very close. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1919.66s)]
*  We're getting a little into the – sorry, go ahead. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1921.06s)]
*  Qatari government will announce it today. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1925.06s)]
*  Do you expect it? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1926.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to speculate at all about when an announcement will come. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1927.8600000000001s)]
*  What's your priority when we are talking about bringing and releasing the hostages? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1931.86s)]
*  Is that elderly or the American people? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1936.26s)]
*  Again, I don't want to talk to the underlined. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1938.26s)]
*  We ultimately – our goal has been to see the release of all hostages. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1940.26s)]
*  We think there's no reason that Hamas ought to be holding hostages at all. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1945.26s)]
*  As a reminder, I stand up here and take all these questions about what the government [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1949.26s)]
*  of Israel has done. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1952.26s)]
*  Hamas continues to hold hostages, elderly people, children, sick people. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1953.26s)]
*  They all ought to be released immediately. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1958.86s)]
*  Now, what the arrangement might look like, I'm not going to speak to any underlined details. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1961.06s)]
*  How do you try to put some American – [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1965.06s)]
*  I'm just not going to – I'm going to draw the line and not decline to comment on any further details. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1967.06s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1973.06s)]
*  I do appreciate all the questions. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1974.06s)]
*  There's been some creative attempts, but I'm going to decline. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1975.06s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1979.06s)]
*  Change of subject? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1980.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1982.06s)]
*  U.S. ambassador in Pakistan, Donald Bloom, announced the aid package of $4 million for [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1983.06s)]
*  Pakistani security forces to bluster Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1989.06s)]
*  But a group of U.S. lawmakers in a letter to Secretary Blinken asked Biden Administration [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=1995.06s)]
*  to suspend all military assistance to Pakistan for human rights violations and for the political crisis. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2001.06s)]
*  Would you provide any details about that aid package and how you respond to that letter of U.S. lawmakers? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2008.06s)]
*  So I wouldn't want to preview how we would respond to the letter here. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2014.06s)]
*  I would obviously respond directly to those members of Congress. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2017.06s)]
*  With respect to the announcement that the ambassador made, we'll be pursuing four new initiatives to support [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2021.06s)]
*  the Balochistan police and their efforts to protect and serve their local communities. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2026.06s)]
*  We're going to provide $4 million in assistance to expand the anti-terrorist force training facility, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2030.06s)]
*  $2 million to repair or replace 10 flood-damaged police stations, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2035.06s)]
*  $2 million to construct 10 new police stations that incorporate the same model to improve service to women, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2039.06s)]
*  girls, and all Pakistanis, and then an additional $250,000 in equipment to protect law enforcement officers [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2044.06s)]
*  in the course of conducting their work. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2050.06s)]
*  These initiatives build on more than 40 years of partnership between the U.S. mission in Pakistan [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2053.06s)]
*  and the Pakistani government on civilian security and rule of law. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2058.06s)]
*  And from our standpoint, the partnership improves justice institutions and provides law enforcement agencies [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2061.06s)]
*  with the tools they need to protect Pakistan citizens. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2067.06s)]
*  Sir, Pakistani media is reporting that U.S. Ambassador Donald Blum held a meeting with former Prime Minister [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2070.06s)]
*  Imran Khan in a Diyala prison and discussed the political situation. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2076.06s)]
*  Would you deny or confirm that meeting? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2079.06s)]
*  So I would refer you to the embassy to comment on any meetings the ambassador has had, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2081.06s)]
*  but as we have said a number of times, we do not take a position on candidates for political office in Pakistan [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2091.06s)]
*  or any other country. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2098.06s)]
*  One last question, sir. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2099.06s)]
*  Pakistan is reporting millions of Afghan refugees, but on the request of U.S. government, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2101.06s)]
*  Pakistan says that it would not deport 25,000 Afghan refugees who are waiting for their American visas. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2106.06s)]
*  How would you see this decision of Pakistani government? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2112.06s)]
*  So we are in close and constant communication with the government of Pakistan on the safety of individuals in the U.S. pipeline. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2114.06s)]
*  It is our desire to work in good faith with the government of Pakistan to address any concerns that it may have. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2120.06s)]
*  Our key concern is the safety of the vulnerable and at-risk individuals. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2126.06s)]
*  We believe it is in both our country's interest to ensure the safe and efficient resettlement of refugees and asylum seekers. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2130.06s)]
*  And we join all of our partners in urging all countries, including Pakistan, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2138.06s)]
*  to uphold their respective obligations in the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2143.06s)]
*  and strongly encourage all of Afghanistan's neighbors to allow entry for Afghans seeking international protection [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2149.06s)]
*  and coordinate with international humanitarian organizations to provide humanitarian assistance. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2156.06s)]
*  Can I have a follow-up? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2161.06s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, go ahead. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2162.06s)]
*  Could you give us a sense of numbers on how many Americans, Afghans we're talking about that would be in this pipeline? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2163.06s)]
*  I don't have a number at my disposal right now. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2173.06s)]
*  I'd be happy to follow up and see if we can get it for you. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2178.06s)]
*  I just don't have it in my fingertips. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2180.06s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2182.06s)]
*  I will stay in subcontinent. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2184.06s)]
*  Just to make sure, do you think that the choice of violence by the nationalist party in Bangladesh [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2186.06s)]
*  is contributing to the undermining that democratic process in Bangladesh? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2192.06s)]
*  So we want to see a free and peaceful election in Bangladesh. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2196.06s)]
*  We want to see the elections carried out peacefully. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2200.06s)]
*  That has been our policy, as I've made clear a number of times. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2205.06s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2208.06s)]
*  Will you condemn, I repeat, will you condemn the political violence orchestrated by the BNP [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2209.06s)]
*  to the context of human rights that you care about? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2214.06s)]
*  I think I answered that with my previous answer. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2217.06s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2220.06s)]
*  I have a question on Russia and one on the U.S. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2221.06s)]
*  There is a media report that President Biden will not be attending tomorrow's virtual [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2225.06s)]
*  G20 summit. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2231.06s)]
*  Who will be representing the U.S. tomorrow? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2232.06s)]
*  So I will let the White House speak to the President's schedule. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2234.06s)]
*  I don't have any update on that. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2237.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2239.06s)]
*  And I have one more question on CTBT. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2240.06s)]
*  So as you know, Russia has withdrew its ratification of the treaty, and following that, Secretary [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2242.06s)]
*  Blinken said that the U.S. remains committed to achieving the entry into force of the treaty. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2250.06s)]
*  Can you please clarify, has the State Department done anything over the past two years to advance [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2256.06s)]
*  this goal and to work with the Senate to ratify it? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2263.06s)]
*  Let me take that one back and get you an answer. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2266.06s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2269.06s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2271.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2272.06s)]
*  Matthew, sorry. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2273.06s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2274.06s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2275.06s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2276.06s)]
*  I'm glad to have you. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2277.06s)]
*  I'll be following your question. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2278.06s)]
*  I'm from the Organization of American States. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2279.06s)]
*  I saw your tweet. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2280.06s)]
*  I saw the State Department's reaction to the letter. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2281.06s)]
*  But how much more difficult is it now to hold the Ortega regime responsible for human rights [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2284.06s)]
*  abuses now that they're out of the OAS? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2290.06s)]
*  So we believe, so I will say that we will continue to call for the release of political [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2292.06s)]
*  prisoners in Nicaragua. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2299.06s)]
*  We will continue to work with our allies and partners in the region. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2301.06s)]
*  We do see them trying to avoid accountability measures, including by departing the OAS, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2304.06s)]
*  and it's something we will continue to work with our allies and partners with. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2312.06s)]
*  One more question, if I may. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2316.06s)]
*  It's a separate topic. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2317.06s)]
*  I should have said separate topic earlier. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2318.06s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2320.06s)]
*  There's no rule on how you preface a question. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2321.06s)]
*  I know we're all around the world here. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2323.06s)]
*  This is sort of specific here, so bear with me here. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2326.06s)]
*  Human-born religious workers in the U.S. here on temporary work visas, they're very [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2331.06s)]
*  worried that they're going to be sent back to their countries because of a change in [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2336.06s)]
*  how green cards are processed. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2341.06s)]
*  Basically, they have to wait in a longer line to get their green card, but they're worried [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2343.06s)]
*  in the meantime their temporary work visa will expire and they'll be sent back to their [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2347.06s)]
*  country of origin. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2352.06s)]
*  Bottom line is they're worried their flocks are going to be left behind, their congregations [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2353.06s)]
*  are going to be left behind. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2357.06s)]
*  Does the State Department share those concerns with those religious workers? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2358.06s)]
*  Are you aware of that? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2361.06s)]
*  You are right. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2362.06s)]
*  That is a very specific question. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2363.06s)]
*  Let me take it back and get you an answer. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2364.06s)]
*  Shannon, go ahead. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2365.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2366.06s)]
*  Your counterpart at the NSC, John Koper, was also very careful, but he did say that the [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2367.06s)]
*  State Department might play a role in processing any released American hostages that might [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2371.06s)]
*  want to come home, suggesting it might look like the way non-hostages coming out of Gaza [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2375.06s)]
*  are processed by consular officers. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2381.06s)]
*  Can you say anything more? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2382.06s)]
*  All I would say is that with respect to any released hostage, it would be the same as [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2384.06s)]
*  with respect to any American in the world who needs assistance. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2388.06s)]
*  We would provide them whatever consular assistance we can, and that obviously is true for any [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2392.06s)]
*  released hostages. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2396.06s)]
*  And on the Americans in Gaza, do you have an updated number of how many are seeking [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2397.06s)]
*  to leave the enclave? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2400.06s)]
*  It is still. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2402.06s)]
*  So we have gotten around 800 American citizens, legal permanent residents, and their family [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2403.06s)]
*  members out. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2409.06s)]
*  I don't have any update in terms of the numbers who are seeking to leave from the [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2410.06s)]
*  number I gave yesterday, which was around 1,200. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2413.06s)]
*  But again, that's not the number of American citizens. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2415.06s)]
*  That's American citizens and family members and others. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2417.06s)]
*  Alex, go ahead. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2421.06s)]
*  Back to Ukraine, if you don't mind. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2423.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2424.06s)]
*  Today marks 10 years since Ukraine's revolution of dignitary. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2425.06s)]
*  I just want to give you a chance to speak to that. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2428.06s)]
*  Kremlin keeps calling it a, quote-unquote, foreign-sponsored coup. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2430.06s)]
*  And separately, Russian foreign minister officials of the day were quoted as saying that the [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2434.06s)]
*  coexistence with Ukrainian current, quote-unquote, regime is not possible. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2439.06s)]
*  What is your understanding of that? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2444.06s)]
*  Say that last part again. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2445.06s)]
*  I missed it. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2446.06s)]
*  The coexistence with Ukrainian regime is not possible, they say. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2447.06s)]
*  What is your understanding of what they are saying here, and what is your reaction? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2451.06s)]
*  So I think my reaction would be is that you continue to see the Russian government make [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2455.06s)]
*  outrageous and unacceptable statements about Ukraine. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2460.06s)]
*  And so it just reinforces our conviction to continue to supply Ukraine with the assistance [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2464.06s)]
*  that it needs to defend itself, to repel Russian aggression from its borders. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2470.06s)]
*  We've seen Russia make, and that applies to the first part of your question as well, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2474.06s)]
*  the amount of Russian propaganda that we hear about Ukraine didn't just start this year. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2479.06s)]
*  Last year it has been going on for a number of years. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2483.06s)]
*  And it reaffirms, as I said, our commitment and I think heightens the need for Congress [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2486.06s)]
*  to take action to pass the supplemental request that we've sent up to Ukraine. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2491.06s)]
*  The secretary just today had a call with his G7 counterparts to talk about additional steps [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2496.06s)]
*  that we are taking through the United States and we are taking in concert with our allies [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2502.06s)]
*  and partners and in cooperation with the government of Ukraine to try to harden Ukraine's [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2507.06s)]
*  infrastructure in advance of the winter. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2512.06s)]
*  Last winter we saw Russia striking energy sites, trying to take them down in Ukraine. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2514.06s)]
*  We're working with Ukraine to try to harden its infrastructure in advance of this winter. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2520.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2524.06s)]
*  As you just offer a particular about Maidan's anniversary. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2525.06s)]
*  I just – just what I already said. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2528.06s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2530.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's a few – go ahead and then we're going to wrap here. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2531.06s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2535.06s)]
*  Thank you, Matt. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2536.06s)]
*  Go ahead and we're going to have to wrap up. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2537.06s)]
*  If I could just – this morning's North Korea missile launch, I understand NSC put [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2538.06s)]
*  out a statement saying you guys are still making assessments, but according to Yonhap, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2542.06s)]
*  North Korea is claiming that it successfully put a spy satellite in orbit. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2546.06s)]
*  So are you able to confirm whether or not the launch was successful? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2550.06s)]
*  And if so, how does this change the security situation in the region and for the U.S.? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2554.06s)]
*  So I cannot confirm that assessment. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2560.06s)]
*  It is still something that's ongoing inside the United States government. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2563.06s)]
*  I can say that we condemn the DPRK's unlawful launch of a military reconnaissance satellite today. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2566.06s)]
*  This launch utilized ballistic missile technology, which includes space launch vehicles. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2572.06s)]
*  It violates multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2576.06s)]
*  And we will continue to work with the international community to send a strong signal to the DPRK [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2580.06s)]
*  that its actions will only intensify its isolation as it undermines stability and prosperity [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2585.06s)]
*  on the Korean Peninsula. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2590.06s)]
*  Can you say how concerning it would be if North Korea had a spy satellite? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2592.06s)]
*  I'm just not going to speak to that before we've made a formal assessment. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2596.06s)]
*  And with that, we're out for today. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2600.06s)]
*  I hope everyone has a safe and restful and peaceful Thanksgiving. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2601.06s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxdI2FH5u0I&t=2605.06s)]
