# Hostages are facing a ‘living hell’: Netanyahu adviser
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [December 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM)
*  So reports today that Israel is considering a return to the negotiating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=0.0s)]
*  table to hopefully get some of the 129 hostages, including an estimated eight [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=5.72s)]
*  Americans, out of Hamas's hands in exchange for a pause in the Gaza [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=12.52s)]
*  offensive. But the Wall Street Journal reporting that Hamas is already [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=19.5s)]
*  rejecting the offer. So let's go live now to Tel Aviv for an update on this from [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=22.64s)]
*  Ambassador Mark Regev, senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=27.72s)]
*  and former Israeli ambassador to the UK ambassador. Thank you very much. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Good to have you here today. Obviously these families, and we have spoken with [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=35.8s)]
*  several of them, they hang on every word of the potential of a release. There was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=40.6s)]
*  some suggestion that 40 people might be included in this deal. Is it off? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=45.8s)]
*  It can't be off if it's not on. And we are exploring any opportunity to have our [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=51.92s)]
*  people released. It's a living hell for them in Gaza, obviously. It's a living [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  hell for their families who worry about their loved ones. We're being held by [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  this terrible, brutal, horrific terrorist organization that has shown us what sort [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=69.72s)]
*  of violence it is capable of. And in interviewing the hostages that were [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  released in November, as you recall, in the end of November, we got over 80 [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=80.72s)]
*  Israelis out. The stories they told of physical and psychological abuse were [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=86.0s)]
*  harrowing. So of course we worry about the hostages. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=91.12s)]
*  So, you know, what at that point, the sort of the leverage was to give more [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=94.88s)]
*  supplies into Hamas to allow for a bit of a pause in the fighting for the people [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=102.72s)]
*  of Gaza, of the Gaza Strip as well. I mean, what is the leverage like at this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=109.88s)]
*  point and how what kind of what can be offered in order to help get some of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=114.8s)]
*  these people out? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  So, Martha, the main leverage we have is our military action because we've been [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  hitting Hamas hard. We've been killing its terrorists. We've been breaking up [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=129.12s)]
*  its military machine. We've been going into the tunnels that it's spent all [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=133.88s)]
*  those years building. And we are taking apart slowly but surely Hamas's military [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=137.84s)]
*  capabilities and we're hitting them hard. And just as in the past, military [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=143.16s)]
*  action expedited the release of hostages because Hamas was desperate for a ceasefire. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=148.8s)]
*  And the only way we'll agree to a ceasefire is if they release hostages. We [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=153.96s)]
*  believe the military action we're taking today can help bring out hostages in the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=158.32s)]
*  future. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=163.12s)]
*  How close do you think you are to a new round of serious talks, Ambassador? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  I can I cannot answer that question. I can only say that if there is a serious [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=169.68s)]
*  opportunity to have hostages released, not just talk, a serious opportunity, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  Israel will embrace that possibility and will keep the pressure on Hamas up, will [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=180.56s)]
*  keep ratcheting it up until we get that release. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=185.72s)]
*  How forceful are the efforts to extract hostages separate from a, you know, a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  ceasefire, momentary ceasefire deal? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=196.04s)]
*  So obviously our forces in Gaza are always on the lookout for for hostages to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=199.48s)]
*  release hostages if we can find any. Our soldiers who are going into battle, they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  are motivated, they're committed to defeating Hamas and they have as their [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=210.56s)]
*  top priority. If they can find hostages and free them, they'll do so. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=214.12s)]
*  Well, we know these families and we pray for them and we know they hang on every [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=218.8s)]
*  word of hope and that as the fighting continues, it is more difficult for them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=222.64s)]
*  So we hope that these hostages will be extracted or released soon and that a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=229.52s)]
*  deal to do that will be underway shortly. Thank you very much, Ambassador Regev. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=234.6s)]
*  Good to speak with you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=239.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Martha. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=240.16s)]
*  That I know for sure that you're not going to miss any great commentary, any [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=248.0s)]
*  great news bites, any great interviews coming your way on Fox. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3_GYXKfteM&t=251.0s)]
