# Israel takes out terrorist who led Oct. 7 kibbutz massacre
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [January 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk)
*  Israel's war on Hamas entering a new targeted phase in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=0.0s)]
*  As the country's prime minister warns, they'll be there for at least six more months. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=7.44s)]
*  Correspondent Trey Yngst has the very latest from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=12.56s)]
*  Hi Trey. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=15.96s)]
*  Hey Anita, good afternoon. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=16.96s)]
*  It was an active New Year's in the Middle East just moments after the clock struck midnight. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=19.7s)]
*  Hamas from Gaza fired a rocket barrage toward Tel Aviv. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=25.16s)]
*  So just hours before that we understand that demonstrations erupted in this city, calling [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=29.74s)]
*  for the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency to cut a deal to release the remaining [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=35.26s)]
*  hostages still inside Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=40.14s)]
*  It is day 87 of the war between Israel and Hamas and there is no diplomatic end in sight. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=42.82s)]
*  This is the New Year Eve and everyone's supposed to be happy but we are not happy. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=50.06s)]
*  We cannot be happy because our beloved is somewhere under the ground at the Gaza Strip [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=55.82s)]
*  and we want them home today. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=63.3s)]
*  The calls for a deal come as Hamas told regional media that they won't release any remaining [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  hostages until all of the fighting ends. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=71.78s)]
*  But fierce battles are ongoing today, specifically around Gaza's second largest city of Hanunis. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=74.44s)]
*  It does come as the Israelis say they'll withdraw some reservists from Gaza in a move [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=80.34s)]
*  they say will prepare the country for a prolonged war. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=85.02s)]
*  Overnight Israel launched new air strikes targeting positions in central Gaza and officials [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=87.58s)]
*  say a Hamas-Nukhba company commander who participated in the October 7th massacre was killed during [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  the recent operations. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=98.34s)]
*  Now there are new concerns today not just about the factions inside Gaza including [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=99.94s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad but also other Iran-backed groups like Hezbollah in southern Lebanon [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=104.3s)]
*  that launched new rockets into northern Israel sending thousands of people to bomb shelters. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=110.42s)]
*  Anita? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=115.42s)]
*  Well, and Trey, despite all of that, despite all of this activity along the border there, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=116.42s)]
*  there are reports that in the New Year some of the reservists will be sent home to sort [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=121.0s)]
*  of re-enter civilian life in Israel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  What are you hearing about that? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=129.24s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=131.28s)]
*  There is real concern in Israel that Gaza is just the first chapter in a very difficult [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=133.64s)]
*  book ahead for 2024 because they understand that once the war in Gaza slows down, their [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=138.8s)]
*  forces will have to shift more of their attention to the north and those threats by Hezbollah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  And while many tens of thousands of Israelis have actually been moved from the border with [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  Lebanon, others remain in northern Israel, some unable to return to their homes, and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=156.08s)]
*  people are simply waiting for a solution. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=161.28s)]
*  Now Israeli officials over the past several weeks have shifted their tone a little bit [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=163.24s)]
*  and they've been very clear about what comes next. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  They say there will either be a diplomatic solution to push Hezbollah fighters back from [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=169.73999999999998s)]
*  the northern border between Israel and Lebanon or there will be a military solution. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=174.28s)]
*  They are leaving that up to the Iran-backed militia group, but in the coming weeks we'll [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=179.2s)]
*  get clarity on what comes next and if Israel will take preemptive action against Hezbollah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=183.38s)]
*  Anita? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=189.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=190.04s)]
*  Well, we certainly will wait and see what the New Year brings. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=191.04s)]
*  Trey Yngst, thank you for all your great work there and happy New Year to you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=193.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaPVBons1zk&t=197.32s)]
