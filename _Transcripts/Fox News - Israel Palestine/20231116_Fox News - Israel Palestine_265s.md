# Body of Hamas hostage found, transported to Israeli territory
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU)
*  We want to get to Trey Yanks because those pictures that we've had on the screen there [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=0.0s)]
*  while IELTS has been talking has been the night sky lighting up over Gaza, Trey. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=3.24s)]
*  What's happening at this hour? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=10.4s)]
*  Yeah, hey Sandra. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Israeli forces continue to operate inside Gaza at this hour. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=15.08s)]
*  They use these flares that you see live on the side of the screen to illuminate areas [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  and mark targets so those forces can either move forward or use their air force to strike [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=23.38s)]
*  the different targets. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=28.46s)]
*  Recently though we're following the news of the body of the hostage that was found in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=29.92s)]
*  a building near the Al-Shifa hospital complex. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  We're talking about Yehuda Weiss and she represents one of what we understand to be 240 people [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=38.52s)]
*  that were held inside Gaza following the October 7th massacre. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=44.88s)]
*  And just to tell you a little bit about this woman who represents so many innocent Israelis [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  who were taken and slaughtered by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  She was a woman in her mid-60s. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  She was undergoing cancer treatment. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=59.68s)]
*  She had a husband who was also killed by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=62.0s)]
*  We know from reporting that she and her husband were hiding in their bomb shelter known as [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=66.66s)]
*  a Mamad in Israel in the small community of Bery that sits near to the Gaza border. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=71.48s)]
*  We've reported from there often in the aftermath of that massacre. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=76.84s)]
*  And this woman was a woman of peace. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=80.88s)]
*  She was a woman who worked with kindergarten students and worked in the dining hall of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=83.24s)]
*  her kibbutz, her small community. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=89.28s)]
*  And she was taken into Gaza and slaughtered by Hamas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  She was unarmed and this was the result. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=94.72s)]
*  And unfortunately, her story will not be unique. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  And we are being sensitive to the information that we know due to the families who are in [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  desperate need of any information about their loved ones that were dragged into Gaza on [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=106.92s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  But when you look at her photo, this woman in her mid-60s and you think about her story [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=112.64s)]
*  and her five children who tonight have learned that their mother, in addition to their father, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=117.64s)]
*  was murdered, it really cuts through this entire story and the flares and the rockets [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  and the bombs. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=128.68s)]
*  This is a story about people and people who are mourning tonight, a country that continues [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=130.52s)]
*  to mourn in the aftermath of this brutal massacre that took place in early October. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=134.84s)]
*  So, hey, Trey, it's John here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=140.12s)]
*  So just to be clear, because some of the initial reporting seemed to point to the idea that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=142.44s)]
*  the hostage that was found dead was a member of the IDF. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=147.16s)]
*  That would appear to not be the case. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=150.2s)]
*  But Hamas also said a couple of days ago that an Israeli military hostage had been killed [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=160.48s)]
*  Do we know if that report might be true or is that potentially Hamas propaganda? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=164.48s)]
*  Yeah, so this is a different incident with a 19-year-old soldier. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=172.4s)]
*  And last week, Hamas released a propaganda video of this young woman speaking in front [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=176.88s)]
*  of a camera. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=182.12s)]
*  And then at the end of the video, they had photos of her body. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=183.2s)]
*  And now Hamas claims she was killed in an Israeli airstrike. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=186.24s)]
*  We have no way to independently verify those claims. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=189.44s)]
*  There have been widespread Israeli airstrikes against the tunnel network underneath the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=192.26s)]
*  Gaza Strip. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=195.92s)]
*  In the initial days of this conflict, Hamas and Islamic Jihad claim they were holding [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=197.04s)]
*  hostages in that tunnel system. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=200.96s)]
*  And the difficult part about this story is the Israelis simply don't know where all of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=203.28s)]
*  the hostages are. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  They are trying to track down as much information as they can. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=208.16s)]
*  The Israelis claim, and they've shown us laptops and notebooks. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=211.16s)]
*  They say have information about the hostages. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=214.8s)]
*  They were able to recover from the Al-Shifa Medical Center. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=217.10000000000002s)]
*  We were not able to independently verify those claims either. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  We were not able to look at the laptops or notebooks. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=223.12s)]
*  But it really gets to the core of the situation here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=225.84s)]
*  There are around 240 people still missing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=228.68s)]
*  Some of them are dead, others being held alive by Hamas inside Gaza. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=231.84s)]
*  We do know there are negotiations at a very high level behind the scenes. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  The Qataris are involved in these conversations, along with the Egyptians, the Israelis, and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=240.34s)]
*  the Americans. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=244.32s)]
*  The Israelis are trying to find diplomatic solutions to get those hostages that are alive [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=245.32s)]
*  out of the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=250.0s)]
*  But they are negotiating with a terror organization. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=251.5s)]
*  And Hamas is not going to be clean or clear in these negotiations. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=254.32s)]
*  And that's part of the issue at play here. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=257.16s)]
*  John, Sandra. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=259.04s)]
*  Trey, thank you so much. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=260.04s)]
*  We will check back in with you again shortly. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=261.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=263.48s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ib8KZPSAU&t=264.48s)]
