# Pro-Palestinian college activists deliver message to families of captive Israelis
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY)
*  I came to the event because showing Palestinian solidarity has meant so much and just like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=0.0s)]
*  the history behind it, a lot of people don't know it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=17.56s)]
*  And for the first time, I feel like people are talking about it all of a sudden like [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=20.64s)]
*  it just happened. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=24.32s)]
*  But this is like the reality that the Middle East has been going through for the past 75 [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=25.32s)]
*  years. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=29.16s)]
*  So I just came out to like show that brown voices should be heard too. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=30.16s)]
*  American University students don't stand for Israel and do not support what is going on [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=33.36s)]
*  with our relationship between the Israeli government. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=37.72s)]
*  We should not be supporting it in our administration. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=40.6s)]
*  Our tuition should not be going to defense contractors. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=42.6s)]
*  I think I've been watching what's going on on social media for so long and haven't really [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=46.16s)]
*  said anything and felt like I needed to at least be a presence here and have my support [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  known. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=55.6s)]
*  And so that's why I decided to come out. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=56.6s)]
*  We're out here protesting against what's happening to Palestinians in Gaza, as well [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=58.32s)]
*  as the West Bank. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=64.36s)]
*  And we're protesting the Burwell and certain people of AU's affiliation and support of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=67.44s)]
*  what is going on in what the Israeli government is doing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=76.56s)]
*  I'd sympathize with their pain and I'd pray with them for their families' safe return [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=80.52s)]
*  and I'd hope that they would understand where I'm coming from as well. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=85.08s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry that this has to happen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  And I'm sorry that the Israeli government created Hamas in the first place and funded [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=90.32s)]
*  it for years and has led to the conditions that have put Gazans in a place where they [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=94.66s)]
*  need to resolve. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=99.63999999999999s)]
*  The Gazans have tried to peacefully resolve this. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  They have tried to reach out to the international community and nothing works. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=103.55999999999999s)]
*  It's important to recognize that the people who are in Gaza who are affected by this are [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=106.96s)]
*  not the same as Hamas. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=111.0s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization and they did terrible things. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=112.96s)]
*  No one should be apologizing for it or making any excuses for it, but at this point, obviously [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=117.76s)]
*  we want everyone's families to be safe. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=125.04s)]
*  I don't think children have to suffer because politicians had decisions and awful things [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  that they've done. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=133.16s)]
*  No kid deserves to know how awful the world is, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  And I hope these people get to their families safe, but a lot of Palestinian families lost [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  entire families. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=147.04s)]
*  It's important to recognize the humanity of everyone involved in this situation and everyone [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=148.32s)]
*  involved is people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=152.76s)]
*  It's not the state who we're talking about, it's the people who we need to protect. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzTw5IarsFY&t=154.08s)]
