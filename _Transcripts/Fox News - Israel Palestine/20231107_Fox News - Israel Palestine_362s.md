# Israeli woman begs Hamas to release family missing for one month
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4)
*  Today marks one month since Hamas attacked Israel, leaving thousands dead and hundreds [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=0.0s)]
*  still being held hostage. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=4.44s)]
*  That includes the family of our next guest, including her aunt and uncle and three of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=6.3s)]
*  her cousins that you see on your screen, including two who are just 5 and 3 years old. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=10.26s)]
*  Efret Massacawa joins me now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=16.66s)]
*  Efret, thank you so much for joining us one month after this horrific terror attack that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=19.42s)]
*  left so many families, including yours, broken. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=24.14s)]
*  Bring us back to October 7th. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=27.26s)]
*  Tell us about your last communications with your family members and what that horrible [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=29.48s)]
*  day was like for you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=34.02s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, thank you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=35.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=38.92s)]
*  It's so important to share the personal stories because behind these 240, 240 wonderful people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=39.92s)]
*  And on Saturday, October 7th, I actually had texted my cousin and she told me something [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  is really very wrong. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=58.78s)]
*  And once I realized it is not usual, I immediately called my aunt. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=60.78s)]
*  You can see her on the screen now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=69.34s)]
*  Aunt Mangalee, she is the most wonderful, kind person who makes the best cheesecakes [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=71.3s)]
*  in the whole wide world. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=78.34s)]
*  And I spoke to her and I called her and she was whispering to me and she said she cannot [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=80.82s)]
*  talk something is very wrong going on. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=85.78s)]
*  And I realized again that my feelings were correct. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=88.48s)]
*  And I just told her, so let's not speak. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=93.92s)]
*  You're in the safe room. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  You'll be safe. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=97.4s)]
*  And I love you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=98.84s)]
*  And we just said how much we love each other. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=99.84s)]
*  And that was the last talk and the last thing I know of her and of my uncle and of my cousin [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=103.76s)]
*  and the two beautiful babies you just saw. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=110.64s)]
*  So we were lost. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  We have no idea. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=115.84s)]
*  And all of us were taken with their pajamas from their beds on early 6.30, 7.30, 8 o'clock [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=118.66s)]
*  in the morning on Saturday. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=126.02s)]
*  They were barefoot. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=128.26s)]
*  They weren't even dressed yet. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=129.62s)]
*  They were just taken brutally. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=132.1s)]
*  Not to talk about all those who were murdered and tortured and slaughtered and the stories. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=134.1s)]
*  I must tell you intellectually. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=143.1s)]
*  I know one month has passed, but emotionally, I feel it is as it's a one long day. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  We're not sleeping and we have worry and we keep thinking, where are they? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=156.4s)]
*  Are they well? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  Are they being fed? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=164.72000000000003s)]
*  Do they have enough water? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  What is it if they're deep inside those tunnels and those monsters that took them? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=167.88000000000002s)]
*  Because obviously, these are not people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  These terror monsters, the way they took them. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=176.10000000000002s)]
*  So what does it mean about the fact of their daily life there? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=180.58s)]
*  And it has been a month. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=186.5s)]
*  I did not believe it would take so long. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=188.3s)]
*  We really want them home. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=190.82000000000002s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=193.02s)]
*  You know, Efrat, it is crazy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=194.34s)]
*  And there are so many questions and fears and worries that are so personally felt by [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=196.66000000000003s)]
*  you because you have five family members who are missing and personally felt by people [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  who are looking at the faces of your family members and hearing about the story of your [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=207.6s)]
*  aunt who likes to make cheesecake. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=211.44s)]
*  And I understand that she's not in good health. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=213.6s)]
*  And your family really is a representation of who has been taken. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=215.44s)]
*  Just innocence. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=219.44s)]
*  A three year old and a five year old. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=220.44s)]
*  Beautiful little girls. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=223.04s)]
*  And it is not up to you to figure this out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=224.04s)]
*  But I'm sure you've thought about it a lot. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=226.92s)]
*  How do you think the Israeli government should go about getting your family members back? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=228.86s)]
*  I have to admit, I have my own thoughts all the time. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=235.82s)]
*  By the way, you see my uncle Gaddi, he's drinking wine he made himself. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=239.78s)]
*  He was very proud of it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=245.06s)]
*  And now you see Doan, she is the most adorable young mother to Raz and Aviv. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=246.94s)]
*  So when you ask me about solutions, I feel I'm just in a position of worrying. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  I have to trust that whatever needs to be done. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=265.52s)]
*  But I think that it's not just an Israeli case. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=269.12s)]
*  I think this war on terror, it's an international issue. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=272.32s)]
*  And people all over the world, all over America and Europe and Africa, everywhere in the world, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=276.44s)]
*  should be very worried what happened here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=283.82s)]
*  It's really, it's so hard to talk about because it's just beyond a human being imagination. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=288.06s)]
*  And everybody should understand. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=300.58s)]
*  And I have to say, I am such a worried mom, and I'm sure there are all many, many innocent [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=303.3s)]
*  moms that are maybe being as human shields in the other side. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=310.12s)]
*  I worry about them too, being a mother and knowing this fear. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  I worry of all the innocent. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=319.68s)]
*  But we are in a position where we have to do everything we can. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=322.76000000000005s)]
*  200 innocent people were taken out of their beds. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  People around the world should understand and should do everything they can in order [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=332.68s)]
*  to help this and today. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=338.62s)]
*  Well, you did something today and you shared the stories of your beautiful family members. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=340.78000000000003s)]
*  And we got to see their faces and learn about your aunt, your uncle and your three beautiful [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=345.54s)]
*  cousins. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=350.18s)]
*  Efrat, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=351.18s)]
*  We're going to be praying for you and your family. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=353.82000000000005s)]
*  We hope that they come back to you safely. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=355.22s)]
*  God bless. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=357.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU_79IZnSu4&t=361.78000000000003s)]
