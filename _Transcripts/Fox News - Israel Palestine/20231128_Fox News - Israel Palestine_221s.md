# Identities of freed hostages released
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ)
*  Just going through the names and the ages of these hostages being released and turned [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=0.0s)]
*  over, thank God, to the Red Cross just a few moments ago, so they can make their way back [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=4.0s)]
*  to their families. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=8.72s)]
*  The first on the list here, Adiza Hyman, 84 years old. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=10.32s)]
*  All of these stories have been told while they have been held captive. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=14.96s)]
*  She was taken captive as her neighbors witnessed the terrorists around her. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=19.84s)]
*  They placed her in a car that was driven by gunmen during the initial terror onslaught [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=24.9s)]
*  of October 7th. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=30.58s)]
*  Neighbors described her as a grandmother to many. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=33.3s)]
*  The Times of Israel post pictures of her in her kitchen. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  She cooked for family and friends. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=38.14s)]
*  How her world, her entire life changed in that split-second moment. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=41.58s)]
*  She lived alone. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=48.9s)]
*  She was in her home safe room by herself that morning when those terrorists invaded during [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=50.54s)]
*  that widespread massacre that took the lives of 1,200 Israelis. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=56.059999999999995s)]
*  And now, Joey, we pray that she is in a condition where they can bring her back to the health [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=61.3s)]
*  she was in before this happened. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=67.5s)]
*  We just don't know. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=69.97999999999999s)]
*  We don't have information on their health or how they were treated while they were held [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=70.97999999999999s)]
*  captive. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=74.62s)]
*  No, I think the one thing I always want to remind people is that we see these moments [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=76.62s)]
*  where hostages are released. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=81.7s)]
*  And Hamas tries to use this as propaganda that shows some sort of empathy or care. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=83.66000000000001s)]
*  And it's really important to remember all of these hostages were taken hostage while [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=88.54s)]
*  their friends and family around them were being murdered. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=93.26s)]
*  Some of them tortured and brutalized. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=96.06s)]
*  The act of taking them hostage was a form of torture. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=98.06s)]
*  The act of keeping them hostage was a form of torture for them and their surviving family [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=101.58s)]
*  members. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=105.94s)]
*  There is nothing about this that shows anything good about Hamas. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=106.94s)]
*  This is a strategic move simply to buy themselves more time, to buy more supplies, and maybe [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=110.94s)]
*  bring back more terrorists to join their ranks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=116.42s)]
*  The idea that they're doing anything good by releasing these hostages, they're maybe [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=119.18s)]
*  not doing as much evil as they could, but that's about where that stops. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=122.98s)]
*  And so Israel should be ready to continue the fight because as long as some of these [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=126.9s)]
*  individuals exist, places, things like October 7th are potential happenings in the future. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=130.7s)]
*  Looking again through this list here at Mia Limberg, 17 years old, she was taken captive [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=137.82s)]
*  with her mother, 59 years old, Gabriella Limberg. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=146.06s)]
*  Initial reports did not disclose whether or not the mother was also freed, but she is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=151.57999999999998s)]
*  indeed on this list. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=155.46s)]
*  So a mother and her 17-year-old daughter have also been turned over and are in the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=157.26s)]
*  custody of the Red Cross in Israeli hands right now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=162.01999999999998s)]
*  Joey, if you could stand by with us as we watch this happening right before our eyes [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=166.01999999999998s)]
*  there at the Rafa, near the Rafa crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  John? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=174.66s)]
*  Yeah, there we see the Israeli ambulances ready to receive the hostages as they're released [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=175.66s)]
*  again as 10 Israeli hostages, two foreign nationals. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  We don't know where the foreign nationals are from, but we are told by folks in our [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=184.9s)]
*  Jerusalem bureau that they are not Americans. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  We don't know where they're from, but we're told that they're not Americans. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=194.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, you're talking, Sandra, stories of the hostages, Tamar Metzger, 78 years old, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=197.26s)]
*  is among the hostages being released. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  Her son, Guy Metzger, said a number of days ago when some of the first hostages were coming [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  out, I didn't win the lottery today. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=209.38s)]
*  My mother remains in captivity, but Guy Metzger did win the lottery today because his mother, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=212.46s)]
*  Tamar Metzger, is coming home. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfldBSn5DpQ&t=218.42000000000002s)]
