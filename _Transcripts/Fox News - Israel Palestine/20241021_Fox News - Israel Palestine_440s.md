# This intel leak could be an 'act of treason': Rep. Mast
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI)
*  Israel launching airstrikes on Hezbollah financial operations in Beirut, Lebanon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=0.0s)]
*  They are trying to destroy those terrorists' banking system. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=15.68s)]
*  It comes as the United States is now investigating a leak of highly classified intelligence about [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=19.76s)]
*  the moves that Israel was planning for retaliation against Iran. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=25.28s)]
*  They have every right to do it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=30.8s)]
*  How did the leak happen? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=32.08s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  The leak is very concerning. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  There's some serious allegations being made. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  I think that the United States needs to stand unequivocally by our ally there right now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=39.56s)]
*  There is really, we're on a precipice, I think, Jake, of a new era of security and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  freedom for Israel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=49.32s)]
*  And I think we're very close, I hope, I pray, to ending that conflict there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=50.86s)]
*  But we cannot equivocate. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=55.4s)]
*  We can't appease Iran. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  Now is the time for a maximum pressure campaign against the head of the snake. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=58.96s)]
*  Let's go to Trey Yanks in Israel, Trey. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  Yaharris, good morning. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=66.72s)]
*  Overnight Israel launched a series of airstrikes against banks linked to Hezbollah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=69.2s)]
*  Smoke could be seen rising from the Beirut skyline as explosions rocked the Hezbollah [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=74.08s)]
*  stronghold of Dakhia and at least one location near the airport. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=78.84s)]
*  In addition to the Lebanese capital, the Beka Valley also saw new strikes after a senior [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=83.36s)]
*  Israeli intelligence official briefed the media about efforts to weaken Hezbollah's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=88.02s)]
*  ability to finance its war against Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=92.24s)]
*  On the ground, Israel is continuing to push deeper into Lebanon with new soldiers entering [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  each day. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=99.6s)]
*  Hezbollah also continuing its attacks into northern Israel, firing hundreds of rockets [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=100.6s)]
*  over the border this weekend. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=105.32s)]
*  With the northern front remaining active, the U.S. Special Envoy Amos Hoechstein is [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=107.08s)]
*  in Beirut today for meetings about a path forward to end the war. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=111.4s)]
*  Israel reportedly gave the U.S. a document last week with its demands for a ceasefire. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  Among the demands is that Israel wants to maintain an ability to conduct raids into [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=119.84s)]
*  Lebanon in what's being referred to as active enforcement of an agreement. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=124.2s)]
*  Israel's southern front also remains active with new evacuation of Palestinian civilians [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=128.88s)]
*  taking place and active ground fighting between Israel and Hamas ongoing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=133.52s)]
*  This weekend, three Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, including an Israeli colonel [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=138.3s)]
*  who served as the commander of the 401st Brigade. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  Colonel Esand Daksa is the highest-ranking Israeli officer killed on the ground in Gaza [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=146.5s)]
*  since the war began. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=151.34s)]
*  With all eyes on the southern and northern front, there is a major question today about [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=153.02s)]
*  how the Israelis are going to respond to Iran following that ballistic missile attack earlier [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=157.02s)]
*  this month. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=161.86s)]
*  Harris? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=162.86s)]
*  The Free Press is asking, is the leak by U.S. intelligence meant to sabotage Israel? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=164.74s)]
*  They say the latest leak could cause Netanyahu's government to decide to share even less of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  its military planning, a major step given the implications for the U.S. of any Israeli [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=175.22000000000003s)]
*  attack on Iran. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=181.46s)]
*  Republican Congressman Brian Mass from Florida is with me now, and he also volunteered for [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=183.62s)]
*  the Israeli Defense Forces and served our military as well. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=188.60000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for all of your service. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=192.7s)]
*  First of all, what do you make of this leak? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=194.22s)]
*  Can you get to the bottom of it on the Hill? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=196.33999999999997s)]
*  I can't sit here and tell you right now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=199.98s)]
*  This is a name that I can identify. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=202.0s)]
*  This is directly where it came from. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=203.83999999999997s)]
*  But I can tell you things peripheral to this that tells us there are unfortunately some [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=205.64s)]
*  leaky shifts out there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=209.22s)]
*  We know that we had in the past Robert Malley, chief envoy to Iran, lost his security clearance. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  I know for a fact, as we speak, there is a senior DOD advisor that was working for an [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  Iranian influence campaign that was working on behalf of Iran to successfully influence [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=221.04s)]
*  American diplomats working in the DOD as we speak. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=226.68s)]
*  We know that you had people in UNRWA that were working for Hamas. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=230.48s)]
*  We have people in UNIFIL, which is the group for United Nations that's in Lebanon that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=235.08s)]
*  have been working with Hezbollah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=240.0s)]
*  So there are a lot of leaks in these ships and it's hard to say exactly where it's coming [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=242.0s)]
*  from, but we know that it's coming. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=245.04s)]
*  So look, given the implications, and I'll ask you about what those are, but the United [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=246.76s)]
*  States strongest ally in that region is Israel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=250.82s)]
*  So anything that hurts Israel, just like Biden has been saying about Ukraine, hurts the United [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=253.78s)]
*  States. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, if what you're saying, that's an act of treason if they worked against us and leaked [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  this material. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=263.38s)]
*  You said it accurately, literally an act of treason. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=264.38s)]
*  Where does that come from and how does it affect us? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=268.06s)]
*  Israel, as you said, I can't add more to it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=270.1s)]
*  They are our greatest aircraft carrier in the region. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=272.21999999999997s)]
*  The best place for any operations to support the United States of America in that region [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  come from Israel, whether it's against Iranian proxies like Hezbollah or whether it's against [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=280.74s)]
*  any of our enemies there and the intelligence that we need, the cross training that we need. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=285.18s)]
*  That's our best aircraft carrier. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=289.26s)]
*  And you look at what they're looking at doing right now with Iran and the potential for [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=291.06s)]
*  targets that they might hit. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=295.02s)]
*  There's great benefit for America there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=296.86s)]
*  If they start hitting Iranian oil in response, well, look at what that does to China, who's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=298.7s)]
*  right now getting, let's say, three, four, five million barrels of oil a day from Iran, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=303.74s)]
*  getting money to Iran from China. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=309.42s)]
*  That's a big way to put China on their heels if Israel attacks them. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=312.18s)]
*  That's one example of how we're affected in that connection. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=317.74s)]
*  That's a lot of great detail for us to dig into. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=318.74s)]
*  Look, whoever takes over after November 5th, it's going to be important that they have [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=320.82s)]
*  the experience and the acumen to deal with people all over the world on these issues. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=326.06s)]
*  It's going to be important that maybe they didn't get us into new situations or end [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=330.02s)]
*  Afghanistan badly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=334.3s)]
*  So that would be the left side of the ticket I'm pointing at here in terms of where the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=336.42s)]
*  weaknesses are. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=339.82s)]
*  But look, let's go to the source. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=340.82s)]
*  Vice presidential candidate or presidential candidate, VP Kamala Harris, was pressed this [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=342.3s)]
*  weekend on the recent escalation in the Israel-Hamas war. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=347.02s)]
*  In her words. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=350.5s)]
*  It's going to be difficult, but we have got to get this war over with. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=351.5s)]
*  We got to get the hostages out. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=357.34s)]
*  We need the war to end. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=358.82s)]
*  The number of innocent Palestinians that have been killed in Gaza, it's really unconscionable. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=359.94s)]
*  And we have to be honest about that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=365.98s)]
*  Any ideas there from how she would handle the situation that is really impending and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=369.42s)]
*  might still be going on on November 6th, the day after? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=374.66s)]
*  We know from her own words that she wouldn't do anything differently than what Joe Biden [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=379.0s)]
*  has done. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=383.14000000000004s)]
*  But where can we juxtapose that to Donald Trump? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=384.14000000000004s)]
*  Donald Trump, we know his yes is yes, his no is no. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=386.86s)]
*  What he says he will do, he will in fact do. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=390.3s)]
*  We know that he has a tremendous backing for Israel. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=392.9s)]
*  Everything that he did in his first administration with recognizing the Golan Heights, the embassy [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=396.46s)]
*  in Israel, the capital of Israel, he has Israel's back in a way that you just don't see coming [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=401.06s)]
*  out of this administration. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=406.08s)]
*  And even in this very moment, you see, in my opinion, Joe Biden not willing to stand [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=407.82s)]
*  on the stage alongside Kamala Harris. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=412.73999999999995s)]
*  I think he doesn't want Kamala Harris dragging down his approval rating. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=414.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, Congress amassed. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=418.38s)]
*  Always great to have you in focus. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=420.26s)]
*  Thank you for your time and your expertise. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI&t=421.74s)]
