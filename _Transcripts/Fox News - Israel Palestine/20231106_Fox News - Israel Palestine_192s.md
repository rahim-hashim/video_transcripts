# Trey Yingst goes inside Gaza with Israeli military
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw)
*  The Israeli military now completely surrounding Gaza City and dividing the Hamas controlled [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=0.0s)]
*  territory in two. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  We find Trey Yanks live in the southern part of Israel with the latest. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=6.8s)]
*  Hi Trey. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=10.52s)]
*  Breaking news here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=15.52s)]
*  As we speak, sirens are sounding in northern Israel, an indication the Lebanese militant [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=16.52s)]
*  group Hezbollah is once again getting involved in the fight. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Here along the southern front we've been watching throughout the day, the Israelis are using [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  artillery units along the border to support their infantry troops inside the strip. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=28.6s)]
*  I'm going to step out of the frame here so you can see the level of destruction in the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=32.28s)]
*  northern part of Gaza. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=35.76s)]
*  Despite the fact the Israelis have been operating in this part of the strip for more than a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=37.36s)]
*  week, you can still see that smoke rising up. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=40.92s)]
*  That's from airstrikes that are being conducted against different Hamas positions. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=43.56s)]
*  Despite the fact that the Israeli military tells us they believe most of the 241 hostages [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  are being held in the tunnels beneath the northern part of Gaza, they're still hitting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=53.42s)]
*  those tunnels trying to get as many Hamas militants as possible. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=57.76s)]
*  You can see in this video we captured last night along the border, huge explosions lighting [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  up the sky. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=65.28s)]
*  The Israelis using bunker buster bombs to try to get to some of those underground positions. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=66.28s)]
*  All of this comes after Fox News was granted an in-bed with the Israeli military this weekend [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=71.2s)]
*  to get a first-hand look at the battles that are ongoing between the Israelis and Hamas. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=76.12s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=81.24s)]
*  You can hear that gunfire in the distance. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=86.24s)]
*  The Israelis are trying to engage anyone who tries to ambush their forces. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  And the battle is street by street. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=93.56s)]
*  It is urban guerrilla warfare as Hamas is popping out of tunnels and ambushing Israeli [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  troops. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=101.44s)]
*  Right now we're embedded with the Israeli military inside the Gaza strip. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=105.44s)]
*  These forces have been ambushed, shot at, and lost more than two dozen of their own [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=109.6s)]
*  soldiers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  Still they fight block by block in bloody urban battle. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Their enemy Hamas guerrilla fighters popping out of tunnels and trying to kill as many [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  of the Israelis as they can. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Now take a look at this video here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=127.84s)]
*  It was released by the Al Qassam Brigades of Hamas from the same day in the same neighborhood, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=129.28s)]
*  the Joradik neighborhood of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=134.96s)]
*  As we were embedded with the Israelis, they were engaging these militants and you can [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=137.8s)]
*  see by this video they're using rounds from RPGs that are specifically designed to penetrate [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  armor. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=147.32s)]
*  So even having APCs and heavy equipment inside, those Israeli forces are not safe as they [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=148.32s)]
*  push deeper into the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=153.27999999999997s)]
*  We do know that overnight the Jordanians dropped some aid into Gaza using an airdrop that was [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=155.48s)]
*  likely coordinated with Israel, trying to get much needed support to Palestinians inside [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=161.0s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  All of this taking place is just seconds ago. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  We got another development out of Jerusalem, Dana, where we have learned that a border [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=169.24s)]
*  police officer who was stabbed this morning in Jerusalem during a terror attack has died. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  Another front opening up not only in the north, the south, but also in the city of Jerusalem [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  and attacked this morning. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  Dana? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=188.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=189.0s)]
*  Thank you for all of the updates of the breaking news. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=190.0s)]
*  Please stay safe. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71flZKIoxRw&t=191.28s)]
