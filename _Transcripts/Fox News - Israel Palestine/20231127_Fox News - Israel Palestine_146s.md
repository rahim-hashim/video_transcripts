# More hostages released from Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw)
*  first to correspondent Jeff Paul, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=0.0s)]
*  who is covering this live breaking [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=2.44s)]
*  story for us from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=4.28s)]
*  Hi Jeff. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=6.0s)]
*  Yeah, Martha and we're watching [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=9.0s)]
*  the images right now as we wait for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=10.44s)]
*  those Red Cross vans and vehicles [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=12.72s)]
*  to cross into Israeli territory like [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=14.52s)]
*  we've seen over the past three days. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=16.44s)]
*  So far no confirmation of them [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=18.6s)]
*  making it into Israel yet, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  but they are on their way. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=21.96s)]
*  But like we've seen in previous days, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=23.72s)]
*  Martha today had a few delays and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=25.76s)]
*  that really just speaks to the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=27.76s)]
*  just how fragile this deal is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=29.44s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=31.36s)]
*  Not a lot of trust, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=32.68s)]
*  obviously between both sides. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=34.2s)]
*  But here's what we know about [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=35.6s)]
*  the 11 who were released today. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  We know nine of them are kids, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  the two youngest, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=41.64s)]
*  just three years old. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=42.6s)]
*  Also two moms in that group as well. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=44.08s)]
*  Just the day before 14 Israelis [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  made that same journey where they now [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=48.84s)]
*  joined 26 other Israelis released [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  in the previous days. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=53.2s)]
*  Now they're all in some sort of stage [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=54.6s)]
*  of treatment and recovery after [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=57.2s)]
*  spending roughly seven weeks, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=59.08s)]
*  some more than 50 days, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  likely exclusively in the darkness [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  of Hamas tunnels. However, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=64.0s)]
*  there is still well more than 100 [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=65.52s)]
*  hostages that have yet to be released [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=67.84s)]
*  by Hamas so we could see more being [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  freed over the next two days as [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Qatari officials broke the news a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=75.38s)]
*  little while ago about extending [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=77.6s)]
*  the temporary trees truce. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  Israel had previously said that they [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  would extend the pause in fighting by [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=83.44s)]
*  one day for every 10 additional Israeli [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=85.84s)]
*  hostages released, but keep in mind. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=88.48s)]
*  Once a mass stops releasing hostages, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=90.68s)]
*  Israeli forces will likely resume [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  their combat operations in Gaza to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=94.76s)]
*  both eliminate Hamas and rescue [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=96.92s)]
*  their remaining hostages. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=98.64s)]
*  We want to receive another additional [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=102.68s)]
*  50 hostages beyond tonight on our [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=105.0s)]
*  way to bringing everyone home and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=107.16s)]
*  as soon as that framework expires, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  Israel will continue with full force [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=111.44s)]
*  towards those three objectives. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=113.56s)]
*  Eliminating Hamas, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=115.12s)]
*  making sure the Gaza Strip can never [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  be a security threat to Israel. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=117.96s)]
*  I'm releasing all the hostages. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  Now we know more aid trucks made [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=121.72s)]
*  it into Gaza today as well, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  and we are awaiting confirmation [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=125.55999999999999s)]
*  that more than 30 Palestinian prisoners [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=127.24s)]
*  will be released from Israeli jails. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XAMJXKDQw&t=129.23999999999998s)]
