# If you want to help Gaza, you need to get rid of Hamas: Sen. Blackburn
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [June 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM)
*  Anita, for more on this, we have Republican Senator from Tennessee, Marsha Blackburn, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=0.0s)]
*  joining us now from Normandy, France. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=5.48s)]
*  Senator, I really want to go into sort of your thoughts and reflections of the past [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  few days in the anniversary of D-Day, but I want to take our viewers back to that live [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=12.32s)]
*  shot from Mike Emanuel, and you can see the thousands of anti-Israel protesters that are [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=16.84s)]
*  gathering now intending to form a line around the White House. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=24.56s)]
*  And an irony perhaps here, Senator, that the very freedoms that they are exercising right [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=28.52s)]
*  now to protest against Israel were freedoms secured 80 years ago by the heroes of Normandy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=34.48s)]
*  But as we look now at these protesters and other anti-Israel protests, Senator, your [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=44.16s)]
*  thoughts on what we're seeing here? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=48.28s)]
*  One of the things that we need to all do today is be grateful that four hostages have been [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=52.1s)]
*  rescued and that the IDF pulled off a successful rescue. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=58.46s)]
*  And Griff, we ought not to lose sight of that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=64.98s)]
*  And we should be supporting Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=68.34s)]
*  We should stand with Israel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=70.6s)]
*  We should make certain that Israel has what they need to defend themselves and to rid [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=72.56s)]
*  the face of the earth of Hamas. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=80.22s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization, and they carried out this attack on October 7th. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=82.9s)]
*  So I'm grateful that we have Israel with the ability to defend themselves and to do what [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=90.42s)]
*  they need to do to protect their people and to make certain that those hostages are rescued. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=98.42s)]
*  Senator, do you believe that these four hostages would have been rescued had Israel heeded [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=105.78s)]
*  the Biden administration's call for a ceasefire or these protesters call for a ceasefire? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=113.54s)]
*  Griff, what we know is that Israel knows best what they're going to need to do to defend [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  themselves. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  That is their right to defend their country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=127.18s)]
*  And while they do need aid from the United States, they need to buy equipment from us. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=130.42s)]
*  And we have partnered and have supported them with the Iron Dome, with David Sling, and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=139.18s)]
*  with other components that are necessary for that defensive battle posture. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=145.29999999999998s)]
*  I think that we need to support that effort. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=151.14s)]
*  And no, I don't think a ceasefire is what is needed. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=155.82s)]
*  Obviously, the IDF and the leadership in Israel does not think the ceasefire is needed. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=160.22s)]
*  They think what is needed is a plan that will rescue these hostages and will rid Gaza of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=177.66s)]
*  If you want to help the people that are in Gaza, the Palestinians, the Gazans, what you [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=178.94s)]
*  need to do is to get rid of Hamas and get rid of that activity that has kept the Palestinians [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  oppressed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=193.46s)]
*  You're looking at some of the four hostages that were rescued here in the last 24 hours. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=195.58s)]
*  And Senator, the organizer of this massive protest, an ANSR coalition, is the group. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=201.22s)]
*  It's led by a guy named Brian Becker. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=207.78s)]
*  And he says to me this morning, Biden could end this war tomorrow by telling Netanyahu [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=209.38s)]
*  that USAID to Israel will end if they don't stop the invasion. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=214.22s)]
*  Your response? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=219.82s)]
*  I would remind many people that Hamas is the one that carried out an attack on October [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=221.98s)]
*  7th. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=230.98s)]
*  Before that, basically you had had a ceasefire and you had the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=232.22s)]
*  And Griff, they need to remember that all changed when Hamas attacked Israel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=241.42s)]
*  They were not at war. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=247.98s)]
*  They were not fighting. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=249.92s)]
*  It was an unprovoked attack and citizens and some U.S. citizens lost their lives, were [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  captured. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=258.58s)]
*  We need to remember this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=259.58s)]
*  Senator, I want to pivot just a little bit because you are in Normandy, such a historic [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=261.74s)]
*  occasion this week. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=266.94s)]
*  And many are now comparing President Biden's speech to the famous 1984 Reagan speech, the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=268.41999999999996s)]
*  boys' appoint to hawk speech. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=274.53999999999996s)]
*  Here's just a clip of some of that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=276.82s)]
*  Play that and get your reaction. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=279.34s)]
*  We've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=281.26s)]
*  tyrannical governments with expansionist intent. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=285.7s)]
*  But we try always to be prepared for peace, prepared to deter aggression, prepared to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=290.34s)]
*  negotiate the reduction of arms. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  Did you see a parallel between President Biden's remarks and Reagan's famous speech? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=299.34s)]
*  As I sat there listening to President Biden's speech, I did not think that in comparison [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=306.86s)]
*  to Reagan's speech in 1984. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=315.18s)]
*  And Griff, I think one of the things to me that was so meaningful was visiting with Tennesseans, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=319.98s)]
*  with World War II veterans, hearing their stories, listening to their recounts of that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=326.5s)]
*  day and listening to their words about how important it is to realize that we, the United [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=335.26s)]
*  States of America, we are the leader of the free world. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  And that is something we ought not to forget. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=347.3s)]
*  Our viewers seeing pictures of you with many of those heroes, some of them the brave teenagers [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  that stormed Utah Beach in Normandy. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=358.1s)]
*  Just lastly, what was it like for you personally trying to describe what it was like to be [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  among them and to see them and the emotions you felt? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=367.3s)]
*  Oh, Griff, when you see them welcomed as heroes, they loved it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=371.26s)]
*  They were so excited that they were being well remembered and that they were being thanked. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=378.7s)]
*  And it was wonderful to watch them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=385.18s)]
*  That was such a special day for them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=389.09999999999997s)]
*  Some of them have not been back at all. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=391.09999999999997s)]
*  Their families were with them. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=393.97999999999996s)]
*  They were able to actually be there on Omaha Beach. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=395.58s)]
*  They were actually able to talk with other veterans who, whether it was there at Omaha [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=399.82s)]
*  Beach or whether it was Battle of the Bulge, they told those stories and it would help [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=406.62s)]
*  them recall some of those memories that they had and what they had lived through during [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=413.82s)]
*  that time. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=422.21999999999997s)]
*  And it also, I think, was really thrilling for them to come back and drive into Normandy [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=424.14s)]
*  and drive through all of these villages. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=432.06s)]
*  And they're seeing the French flag and the U.S. flag flying together. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=434.78s)]
*  And we are forever grateful for their brave actions and heroism. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=440.78s)]
*  Senator Marsha Blackburn, thank you for taking time to join us from Normandy today. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=445.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvAjXE88NKM&t=453.26s)]
