# Israeli forces reportedly surround 3 Gaza hospitals housing Hamas
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI)
*  Let's get an update on the war from Trey Yitz reporting live from the ground in southern Israel. Trey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, hey Todd Carley, good morning. We know the battles inside Gaza rage on behind me. Israeli forces [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=7.04s)]
*  are reportedly surrounding three separate hospitals in the northern part of the Gaza Strip [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  where they say Hamas militants are hiding. I do want to show you the level of destruction behind [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=18.16s)]
*  me though here along the northern part of Gaza. We've been watching today as the Israelis renew [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=22.72s)]
*  their strikes against this area. Also this morning Israel says 37 of their soldiers in total have been [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=27.2s)]
*  killed in the battles since the ground portion of this operation began. Now overnight Israel pushed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=34.56s)]
*  deeper into Gaza. They say they were targeting Hamas's elite Nukba forces that participated in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=40.16s)]
*  the October 7th massacre. They say they killed a number of company commanders and also platoon [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=45.6s)]
*  commanders from Hamas who were in part responsible for that slaughter of civilians in early October. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=50.64s)]
*  They also say there was a separate incident that killed 19 Hamas operatives as they were engaged in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=57.28s)]
*  gun battles inside Gaza City. You can see they continue airstrikes against different Hamas tunnel [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  positions throughout Gaza. Those strikes overnight shaking the ground as the Israelis are looking to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  hit Hamas above and below ground. We do know they are trying to get more civilians out of the way, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=73.36s)]
*  opening an evacuation corridor for Palestinians to go to the southern part of Gaza. Yesterday [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=78.56s)]
*  alone the military says 80,000 Palestinians took that corridor. Now all of this comes as attacks [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=83.6s)]
*  continue from Iranian proxies across the Middle East, not just against Israel but also against [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=89.52s)]
*  American forces. Dozens of those attacks have taken place since this war began and following [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=94.8s)]
*  the American strikes in eastern Syria we know at least four separate attacks have taken place [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=100.0s)]
*  against American interests in both Iraq and Syria. Todd, Carly. Hey Trey, so yesterday the United [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=104.96s)]
*  States announced that there will be four-hour pauses in fighting but Brett Baer spoke to Israeli [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=110.96s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and we're going to play a little bit more of that after we speak [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  to you but he kind of pushed back on that idea and he said that the fighting is going to continue, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=121.6s)]
*  there's just going to be these humanitarian corridors that are going to open up so what's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  really going on with these pauses? Yeah absolutely. I talked to a defense official last night on the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=129.12s)]
*  phone and that source indicated that the Americans came out with this idea there would be [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=136.64s)]
*  four-hour pauses across the board in the fighting and the Israelis say that simply is not the case. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=141.76s)]
*  They are calling this basically a tactical pause that will be implemented not across the Gaza Strip [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=146.48s)]
*  but only in certain neighborhoods with one goal in mind to get more civilians out of the way. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=151.27999999999997s)]
*  Now one part of this that we should note, the Israelis as I said have surrounded hospitals in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=155.92s)]
*  the northern part of the Strip. We understand there are still civilians being treated in those [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=160.56s)]
*  hospitals so we can expect the coming hours to be incredibly important in terms of the information [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=164.64s)]
*  that we receive out of Gaza to be clear about what's taking place on the ground and how the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  Israeli forces are operating inside the Strip. All right Trey Yanks live for us in southern Israel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82HJoNwbeI&t=173.92s)]
