# McEnany: The press would have never let Trump get away with this
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM)
*  Biden is preparing for that news conference. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=0.0s)]
*  You know someone in the press pool will ask him about this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=3.04s)]
*  Do you think at this point Prime Minister Netanyahu is more concerned about his political [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=7.2s)]
*  survival than he is in the national interest of his people? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=12.92s)]
*  What I will tell you is I think what he's doing is a mistake. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=15.84s)]
*  I don't agree with his proposal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=19.68s)]
*  I think it's outrageous. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  What I'm calling for is for the Israelis to just call for a ceasefire, allow for the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=22.639999999999997s)]
*  next six, eight weeks total access to all food and medicine going into the country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=31.519999999999996s)]
*  So there he was and Biden's criticism coming at a time of heightened anti-Israel protesting. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  He's talking and they're chanting back to him. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=45.28s)]
*  From the river to the sea and death to America can be heard across the United States now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  In addition to Tehran and other places where they hate us around the globe. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=53.28s)]
*  Griff Jenkins has the latest on the protest. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  Hey Harris, look we know the press is going to hound Biden at that press conference after [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Hamas rejected the U.S.' plan for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza but just moments ago the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=64.48s)]
*  president told our colleague Jackie Heinrich he's still quote negotiating, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=70.08s)]
*  we'll bring you that exchange when we get it but obviously this is very fluid. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=74.4s)]
*  Now it comes after you mentioned these anti-Israel protests are ramping up. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=78.56s)]
*  Yesterday they descended on the Senecafeteria, many of them displaying blood on their hands. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=83.36000000000001s)]
*  And apparently they're up there again today getting tangled up with Senator Josh [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=88.72s)]
*  Hawley in the Senate hallway but an organizer tells me Harris that these painted hands signify [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=108.16s)]
*  being spilled in Gaza but for some Israelis this conjures up a painful memory and images [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=113.68s)]
*  like this of a Palestinian youth with the actual blood of two IDF soldiers lynched by a mob in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  Ramallah in 2000. The president of Human Rights Voices telling Fox News Digital the red hands [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=126.0s)]
*  are meant to represent the emasculation of Jews in a bloody defeat and it's not the first time [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=132.88s)]
*  Harris we've seen this with this group back in November bloody hand imprints you see here were [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=138.08s)]
*  painted on the gates of the White House. Now meanwhile out in Dearborn, Michigan, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=143.52s)]
*  chance of death to America, you hear them here at this demonstration where the organizer appeared [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  to call for a revolution. It's not genocide Joe that has to go, it's the entire system that has to go. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  Well here's how the White House responded yesterday. Should we expect a statement from [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=162.4s)]
*  the president on that though? I mean it was a pretty significant display. I mean you're hearing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=166.96s)]
*  from me I think that's important. The other part too that I do want to be very clear about you know [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=170.72s)]
*  peaceful protest is something that the president has also been very very clear that is important [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=175.84s)]
*  to give folks space to peacefully protest but any type of violent rhetoric we are going to denounce. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=181.36s)]
*  And finally we'll see if the president has anything else to say about this report. In the last hour [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=188.24s)]
*  we've learned that an Israeli airstrike has killed three sons of Hamas's supreme leader. Harris? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=192.8s)]
*  All right we'll cover the news as it happens. Griff thank you very much. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  So you know Todd as we're as we're covering this it will be it will remain to be seen if the president [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  has asked about his comments about Israel today. We do know that former president Trump was asked [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=208.96s)]
*  about it. We'll show the audience when we're ready to when we can get that isolated because we just [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  took him live. But this is now becoming another hot issue for the president along with [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=217.68s)]
*  ticking up inflation and immigration is number one. As it should be because it is a war involving [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=222.56s)]
*  our greatest adversary but I keep coming back to this notion not our greatest adversary probably [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=227.52s)]
*  our greatest ally. I keep coming back to this notion. How would America respond? How would [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  president Biden respond if everybody in the world told us how to fight a war following a major terror [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  attack? I'd like to think that president Biden would do what is in the best interest of our [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=244.24s)]
*  country and not listen to the noise from abroad. It is insulting I think to Israel it's insulting [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=248.56s)]
*  to the American people that he is letting the campaign and his loss of the Michigan Muslim [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=255.84s)]
*  and the far left Palestinian caucus that exists in our country guide him on this issue when he saw [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=262.0s)]
*  that it was politically necessary for him. He's doing this to win the election and it's not just [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  him Harris you have Tim Kaine, Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren all siding with this notion [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=274.56s)]
*  this far left notion because they want to win in November. It's sad and it's not how it should be. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=282.24s)]
*  So Emily what has happened in the last couple of days that really is mind-boggling is we're now [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=288.32s)]
*  forcing them into a ceasefire by threatening to take away the ammunition and Nancy Pelosi says [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=293.12s)]
*  that should definitely happen we just gave them weapons not let's not give them more they're in [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=298.8s)]
*  the middle of the war so you know irrespective of what people would say about us if we were fighting [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=302.8s)]
*  a war would they help us if they were already helping us or turn their backs on us? An action [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  speech speaks so much louder than words and I think on that note that speaks volumes and let's [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=312.88s)]
*  go back to the nearly four decades that Biden has known Netanyahu because I think what we're hearing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  right now is a lot from this administration in some type of moment-to-moment present-day reaction [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=323.92s)]
*  that has nothing to do with this very long relationship but let's look at Biden's actions. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  So in 2014 first of all the Atlantic called the relationship between the United States and Israel [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=335.12s)]
*  on the brink of a collapse. It was sort of fomented during the Obama years because in part the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=341.36s)]
*  Iran nuclear deal that Netanyahu vociferously opposed that Jewish Americans opposed that most [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=348.08s)]
*  reasonable rational Americans opposed and yet it was under that strain that there became this sort [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=353.68s)]
*  of deviation from the important partnership between Israel and the United States and Biden at the time [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=358.4s)]
*  in 2014 said I don't agree with the damn thing you say BB but I love you and to me that unprofessional [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=364.32s)]
*  callous sort of frankly demeaning tone is what's reflected here. I don't believe that the president [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=372.64s)]
*  knows exactly what he's saying I believe that he is just ping-ponging in between the current state [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=378.48s)]
*  and people are telling him we have to win this in Michigan we are losing these voters on the left [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=384.16s)]
*  and he is ignoring the most the strongest alliance of our countries for decades. Think about when he [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=388.72s)]
*  appointed the ambassador September in 23 over two years after he assumed the presidency here so to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=394.32s)]
*  me this is an unfortunate reality that this president does not represent the strength of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=401.2s)]
*  the relationship that us Americans feel. Our reporter Jackie Heinrich and the president back [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=405.36s)]
*  and forth in a Q&A on a hostage or the topic was the hostages or a ceasefire do we have that to show? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=411.12s)]
*  No okay I want to ask about it though because our reporter said any movement on the hostages or a [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=419.2s)]
*  ceasefire Biden says still negotiating Heinrich says still negotiating Biden says nothing appears [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=424.88s)]
*  to nod. Right and to me that is the key point look October 7th happened we know what happened [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=432.0s)]
*  that day and I will say it over and over again babies were put in ovens women were raped that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=438.8s)]
*  happened me others many people in this building predicted we are with Israel today but give it [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=444.64s)]
*  time give it a few weeks give it a few months Biden we predict we'll backpedal on this well [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=451.52s)]
*  here we are we are a few months from an election there are hostages more than 130 hostages some of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=456.96s)]
*  whom are American and what's the call ceasefire to your point Todd Pyro what you said is so [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=463.76s)]
*  important if we as a country had more than 130 hostages in the hands of an enemy after an attack [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=469.28s)]
*  on let's say Houston let's just pick a city where our children were put in ovens and Great Britain [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=475.68s)]
*  and France and Spain told us put down your arms ceasefire when you have hostages abroad no thank [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=481.35999999999996s)]
*  you this president should stand with Israel and by the way he should condemn the death to America [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=487.11999999999995s)]
*  chance coming out of Dearborn you had Karine Jean-Pierre saying I speak for the president [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  well if the Trump administration had tried that yes you do speak for the president but the press [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=495.67999999999995s)]
*  wouldn't have let you get away from that we need to hear from the commander in chief not the press [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  secretary so what's interesting about that it kind of reminds me of the summer of love when [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  people were breaking into businesses and a police officer was even killed in one of our great cities [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=507.12s)]
*  by protesters who were being allowed to work it out you know work it out you know enjoy that [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=512.48s)]
*  freedom if you will so death to America freedom of speech but I agree it doesn't mean you can't [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=518.64s)]
*  comment that you don't agree with that exactly and we've given these protesters so many passes [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=524.88s)]
*  do you remember when they were shouting from the river to the sea we're like oh maybe they don't [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=530.72s)]
*  know what they're actually saying and now the red hands oh they don't know what that actually [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=534.8s)]
*  signifies to Israelis the lynching of those IDF soldiers we need to stop giving them passes [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=539.68s)]
*  because as you both said America has skin in the game here 30 killed and Americans killed October [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=544.88s)]
*  7th at least five American hostages we know still in custody America is in this fight so we have to [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=552.16s)]
*  start acting like it period when was the last time you heard the American president mention [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=557.5999999999999s)]
*  American names who were killed or taken hostage exactly yep still waiting I mean I know he couldn't [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=562.8s)]
*  say Lake and Riley but can he go there can anybody in his administration do it can can they go there [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=568.0799999999999s)]
*  on this day that's a challenge I'm really curious to see why they are asleep at the switch [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=574.4799999999999s)]
*  and we leave no Americans behind but we did in Afghanistan so maybe it's a habit hey everyone [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENTKaCD3ZkM&t=579.8399999999999s)]
