# Columbia University president 'negotiated with the terrorists': GOP lawmaker
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw)
*  Joining me now with more on all of this and the Sunday Morning Futures exclusive is House [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=0.0s)]
*  GOP Conference Chair, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who has been at the forefront of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=4.08s)]
*  exposing anti-Semitism on college campuses. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=8.36s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's good to see you this morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=10.68s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=12.6s)]
*  Good to be with you, Maria. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  So assess the situation today after we did see a fair amount of cleanup at some colleges [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=15.52s)]
*  over the weekend. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=21.2s)]
*  And I want to get your take on what you want to see happen in terms of federal funding [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=22.2s)]
*  of college universities. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, Maria, this is a crisis in higher education. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  And I want to thank our law enforcement officers. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  You played the clip of the NYPD. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=33.34s)]
*  But who has failed are the university presidents. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=35.82s)]
*  Our law enforcement have done the right thing, bringing security back to these college campuses. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  But our university presidents, whether it's Columbia, whether it's Harvard, Penn, whether [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  it's UCLA, Michigan, Yale, the list goes on. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=45.78s)]
*  They have failed to protect Jewish students. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=49.24s)]
*  They have also failed to condemn anti-Semitism. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=50.94s)]
*  And let's be honest. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=53.96s)]
*  These pro-Hamas riots. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=55.56s)]
*  This is Joe Biden's Democrat Party. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  Joe Biden not only waited 10 days to condemn, he has been silent since last December with [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=59.6s)]
*  that historic hearing where you had three Ivy League university presidents fail to condemn [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  the genocide of Jews. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=70.84s)]
*  Joe Biden waited months to speak out, saying that testimony was unacceptable. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=72.16s)]
*  He didn't even say that, actually, in his statement, but he gave it lip service. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=76.24s)]
*  But this is the radicalized far-left Democrat Party that Joe Biden owns today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=79.98s)]
*  It is about lawlessness. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  It is about anarchy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=85.53999999999999s)]
*  It is attacking our most precious ally, Israel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=87.0s)]
*  And it is hurling anti-Semitic slurs against Jewish students, as well as physical harassment, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  physical assault against Jewish students. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=96.02000000000001s)]
*  So there is a great deal that we are doing in Congress in our oversight. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=97.76s)]
*  And our legislative solutions will consist of pulling back federal funding, addressing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=101.56s)]
*  the foreign dollars that are flowing into these institutions, and holding these schools [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  accountable. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=110.78s)]
*  Why haven't the Democrats been more aggressive on this? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=111.78s)]
*  Chuck Schumer in the Senate, the highest-ranking Jewish person in Congress, hasn't said enough, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=115.86s)]
*  in my view. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=123.38s)]
*  It feels like they're afraid to offend their own base. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=125.04s)]
*  And Joe Biden, he said—the first thing he said was, those who don't understand what's [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=127.94s)]
*  going on with the Palestinians, I also condemn that, whatever that means. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=137.82s)]
*  This is Joe Biden's Democrat Party today, the pro-Hamas rioters on college campuses. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=139.1s)]
*  And that's why you're seeing trepidation among Democrats from speaking out, because this [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=146.66s)]
*  is their base. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=151.44s)]
*  And the reality is, this is why Republicans continue to pull stronger and stronger, because [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=152.78s)]
*  we represent peace and security, we represent standing up for the Constitution, we represent [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=157.74s)]
*  supporting our ally of Israel, and we strongly condemn anti-Semitism. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=163.3s)]
*  There is a reason that House Republicans have led on this, and it's because there has been [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=167.9s)]
*  a void at our universities. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  There is a void at the White House, starting with the top of Joe Biden, and there's been [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  a void in Democrat leadership, including Chuck Schumer, which is why we have expanded the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=177.28s)]
*  investigation and will continue to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars to yank federal [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  funding that is propping up these institutions that are indoctrinating our next generation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=188.34s)]
*  Well, I mean, you also have to go back to Schumer's speech on the Senate floor a month [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=193.6s)]
*  ago or so, where he called for new elections in Israel, said that Benjamin Netanyahu is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=197.94s)]
*  not serving the people of Israel anymore. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, this is in the middle of the fight for survival for Benjamin Netanyahu's life [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=205.68s)]
*  and the state of Israel's survival. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=211.56s)]
*  He's attacking Netanyahu. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=214.24s)]
*  It was unacceptable, and I was proud to respond immediately with fellow House Republican leadership [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=216.68s)]
*  condemning Chuck Schumer's statements. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=222.56s)]
*  It is more important than ever that the United States stand strongly with Israel and the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=224.8s)]
*  duly elected leaders of Israel as they are fighting for their very existence. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=229.56s)]
*  And this is why we're very proud to have a strong conference of House Republicans condemning [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=234.54s)]
*  anti-Semitism and supporting Israel. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  That's in stark contrast to Joe Biden, the Democrat Biden campaign, and Chuck Schumer, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=243.0s)]
*  who have failed to support Israel. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=248.32s)]
*  And Joe Biden's silence on this is deafening. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=250.48s)]
*  And he owns these riots because they are a part of the Democrat base, and that's why [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=253.44s)]
*  they're so desperate in trying to morally equivocate from the White House. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=259.9s)]
*  Congresswoman, tell me about this Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, which the House voted on Wednesday. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  It would mandate the Department of Education to use the International Holocaust Remembrance [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  Alliance definition of anti-Semitism. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=274.7s)]
*  Tell me what this does. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=277.22s)]
*  How important is this that you all voted on this week? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=278.3s)]
*  This is very important. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  This codifies President Trump's executive order. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  So President Trump doesn't get credit from the mainstream media, but it was President [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  Trump that expanded Title VI protections for Jewish students on college campuses. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  And the Biden administration and the Biden Department of Education, they have failed [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=295.6s)]
*  to open up investigations into each of these college campuses that have been egregious [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=299.32000000000005s)]
*  and failed to protect Jewish students on those campuses. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  So what this legislation does is that codifies it, it strengthens it legislatively, and we [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  need to continue to hold the Biden administration accountable for their failure to comply with [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=312.46s)]
*  this executive order that's on the books because of President Trump. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=317.78s)]
*  So who is funding this? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=321.58s)]
*  I was told that a lot of these groups were getting their direction from social media. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=323.62s)]
*  At one point, there was a directive on social media to go and take over buildings where [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=328.41999999999996s)]
*  academics take place, and then they went and they took over Hamilton Hall at Columbia. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=332.9s)]
*  We're hearing a lot that there are anti-antagonists that are not connected to the school. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=337.9s)]
*  Give us your sense of who's behind it, who's funding it, and how many people are students [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  versus outside agitators. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=348.64s)]
*  These are really important questions, Maria. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  So this is a well-organized entity of far-left Democrat radical groups domestically. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=352.4s)]
*  It is well-funded, well-organized. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=358.53999999999996s)]
*  But in addition, there is a foreign funding piece that is very important that we get to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  the bottom of, whether it's the foreign funding flowing into these Middle Eastern studies [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=365.14s)]
*  programs at these universities, propping up anti-Semitic professors as well as propagating [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=369.5s)]
*  anti-Semitic curriculum. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=375.38s)]
*  We need to not allow that foreign funding, and that is going to be an important legislative [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=377.1s)]
*  solution. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=382.02s)]
*  In addition, any individuals who are part of these pro-Hamas riots or pro-Hamas encampments [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=383.02s)]
*  who are on student visas, those visas need to be revoked and those individuals need to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=388.82s)]
*  be deported immediately. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=393.66s)]
*  And in the case of Columbia, we found from NYPD that over 40 percent of the rioters were [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=395.46000000000004s)]
*  unaffiliated with Columbia University, meaning they were neither students, professors or [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  faculty members. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  And that just shows the failure of Columbia leadership to deal with this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=408.06s)]
*  They have allowed these outside rioters, these outside far-left Democrat pro-Hamas activists [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=411.48s)]
*  to take over their campuses, putting all students at risk, especially Jewish students. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=416.68s)]
*  So this is why I've called for the resignation of the Columbia president, Manu Shafik. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=421.84s)]
*  She negotiated with the terrorists, and that was a recipe for disaster. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=426.08s)]
*  Look, I know that China also has a role, whether it be the propaganda coming out of TikTok [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=430.08s)]
*  or all the money that China has sent to these institutions, and we never see the Biden administration [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=435.53999999999996s)]
*  push back on that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=440.79999999999995s)]
*  Is it largely the institutes that are connected to college institutions or something else [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=442.35999999999996s)]
*  in terms of China's role? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=448.21999999999997s)]
*  Yes, Communist China has tried to infiltrate our college campuses through their Confucius [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=449.88s)]
*  Institutes. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=455.24s)]
*  This is something that Republicans have worked to address to not allow Confucius Institutes. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=456.4s)]
*  But we're also seeing it in the information warfare space, Maria, that you touched upon, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=461.08s)]
*  on TikTok, which is a Communist Chinese front to collect data. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=465.64s)]
*  It's a national security threat. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=469.26s)]
*  They have promoted anti-Semitic content on TikTok, and they have suppressed any pro-Israel [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=471.02s)]
*  content on TikTok. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=477.28s)]
*  And we know that these radicalized far-leftists utilize TikTok to organize, to get their [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=479.04s)]
*  message out, which is why the ban on TikTok, the requirement that TikTok divest from Communist [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  China, is so incredibly important. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=491.32000000000005s)]
*  We passed that in the House, and that's a big result that we've been able to deliver. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=493.72s)]
*  Congresswoman, before you go, let me switch gears and ask you about the Manhattan trial [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=497.24s)]
*  of President Trump right now. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=500.88s)]
*  I know that you have issued ethics complaints against the judge. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=502.56s)]
*  You also want an investigation of Michael Cohen. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=507.0s)]
*  Tell me what you're doing with regard to that, and how would you assess this trial right [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=509.92s)]
*  now for Trump? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=514.04s)]
*  This is a political witch hunt against Joe Biden's opponent, who is Donald Trump, and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=515.44s)]
*  it's because Democrats cannot win at the ballot box. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=519.72s)]
*  The fact that they have a gag orner on President Trump in the midst of a general election campaign [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=521.96s)]
*  shows how desperate the Democrats are. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=526.56s)]
*  You have a corrupt judge in Judge Merchant. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=528.68s)]
*  Not only did he donate personally to the Biden campaign, but an immediate member of his family [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=531.32s)]
*  is raising tens of millions of dollars off of the trial itself and attacking Donald Trump. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=535.84s)]
*  This is the chief online fundraiser for Adam Schiff to the tune of nearly 90 million dollars, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=540.88s)]
*  Maria. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  So this is corrupt to its core, and yet this is in the left and the corrupt DOJ. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=547.3199999999999s)]
*  This is apparently what they're doing with lawfare, and we need to stand strong and make [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=552.36s)]
*  sure that this never happens again. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=556.4399999999999s)]
*  When it comes to the star witness for this political witch hunt, this is an individual [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=558.64s)]
*  who perjured himself in front of Congress, who is a known liar. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=563.88s)]
*  And I urge the Department of Justice to continue the criminal contempt against Michael Cohen. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=568.5999999999999s)]
*  But there is no case here. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=574.3599999999999s)]
*  It is desperation and it's a desperate form of election interference. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=575.88s)]
*  Congresswoman, you were in Mar-a-Lago this week. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=579.24s)]
*  Did President Trump bring up you being his vice presidential candidate? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=582.24s)]
*  Oh, we had a lot of great members there. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  What really came out across to me, Maria, was how unified the Republican Party is and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=588.28s)]
*  how many rising stars we had. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=592.7199999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of names that are in the mix. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=594.52s)]
*  I'm honored to have my names as one of them in the mix right now. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=596.0799999999999s)]
*  But it is a true testament to the strength of the Republican Party. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=599.4s)]
*  You have so many up and comers who are working hard every day to save America. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=602.5999999999999s)]
*  And this is really a unified campaign to support President Trump, who will save this country [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=606.76s)]
*  this November. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=611.68s)]
*  Congresswoman, it's good to see you this morning. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=612.68s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sToBHz2s8Qw&t=614.16s)]
