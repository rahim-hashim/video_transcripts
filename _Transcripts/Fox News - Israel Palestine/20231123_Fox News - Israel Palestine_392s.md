# Hamas knew this would happen: Capt. Sadler
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I)
*  Retired Navy captain Brent Sadler former Pentagon official now a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=0.0s)]
*  Joins me now. This is a tricky situation. It's a four-day ceasefire essentially [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  This means they can get humanitarian aid they can get 50 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=10.08s)]
*  Hostages released here's the concern obviously you give Hamas an opportunity to rear themselves [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=14.36s)]
*  And what happens to the other? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=21.16s)]
*  Two hundred hostages there were 240 hostages total [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=23.64s)]
*  They're only getting 50 as a release Israel is only getting 50 hostages released meantime the Palestinians are expecting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=27.44s)]
*  150 prisoners in exchange does this seem like a fair and smart deal to you [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, I can't really say if it's fair [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=41.28s)]
*  it certainly doesn't seem like it for soul to soul because [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=43.8s)]
*  The odd the number of Israelis that are being released and maybe even three Americans [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=47.68s)]
*  It's basically a three to one kind of ratio. So fair maybe not smart. Also, I think is questionable [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=52.839999999999996s)]
*  There's a history and there's a tactic behind Hamas taking hostages [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  This was their intent on October 7th when they went in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  to take hostages so that they could then slowly release them and try and force the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=66.36s)]
*  Israeli public and even the American public to slow down or to halt Israel's offensive that they anticipated [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=71.72s)]
*  It's certainly been a lot more effective today [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=77.9s)]
*  But the the end objective still must remain the same the destruction of Hamas in Gaza [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=79.82000000000001s)]
*  Carter's prime minister and top diplomat said that he hoped the deal would eventually lead to a permanent ceasefire and quote serious talks on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=85.3s)]
*  Resolving the Israeli Palestinian conflict that seems to be overly optimistic. Would you agree? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=93.06s)]
*  Very optimistic and and it also ignores the fact that Hamas by intentionally going into Israel on 7 October and taking [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  hostages committed a war crime and it'd be interesting to see if the world [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=107.74s)]
*  Actually looks to try to hold Hamas to account even in the International Criminal Court or other venues [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=111.97999999999999s)]
*  But that is a war crime clear and plain and simple and it can't be rewarded with a lasting [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=117.46s)]
*  Ceasefire that leaves some awesome place. No and there should be no reward whatsoever [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=123.42s)]
*  First of all the Palestinians Gaza and Hamas right now, they're not doing Israelis any favor [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=127.02s)]
*  And and by releasing these hostages, let's just say most of them if not all have been tortured [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=133.70000000000002s)]
*  Many of their family members have been tortured to death in Gaza. God only knows how many hostages there really are there were [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=139.18s)]
*  240 and already there have been multiple that have been found dead the Wall Street Journal's editorial board [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=145.58s)]
*  Writes this on the Israel Hamas hostage deal innocence will be freed [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=151.46s)]
*  But the terrorists get a chance to regroup quote the deal again shows the moral gulf [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=155.74s)]
*  Between the two sides even as Israelis rejoice for the women and children who will return home [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=161.66s)]
*  They know Hamas is rejoicing to its war crimes have been rewarded [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=166.86s)]
*  It will steal fuel from its own people to power its terror tunnels [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  It's shattered northern Gaza brigades will use the ceasefire to regroup [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=175.66s)]
*  Escape from weak positions and set more ambushes for Israeli troops Israel's leaders made this deal [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=181.02s)]
*  Knowing that their soldiers will pay for it your thoughts [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=188.34s)]
*  Well, I think this war has to be fought to its conclusion and the destruction of Hamas and the notion that there can be no [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=193.54000000000002s)]
*  Israel Hamas is is obligated and committed to the destruction of Israel that needs to change and needs to be put aside for [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=201.02s)]
*  Final in the conclusion of this war if anything less than that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=209.5s)]
*  We're gonna be seeing this and confronted with Americans at risk and killing and hostage taking continuing into the future, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  I want to turn to the widening threat in the Middle East Iran proxies attacking US troops in Iraq and Syria [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  66 times in just over one month [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  Pentagon officials are saying the latest was a ballistic missile attack on al-assad airbase in Iraq [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=232.1s)]
*  Eight of our American troops were injured in that one the US military hitting back only its fourth [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=237.44000000000003s)]
*  retaliatory strike after a dozen of US military members have been wounded this round included an immediate [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=244.08s)]
*  self-defense strike and another that targeted two facilities in Iraq now this marks the first time [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=252.12s)]
*  That the US has carried out an airstrike in Iraq since President Trump ordered the one that killed Iranian [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=259.04s)]
*  General Soleimani back in 2020 the three previous US strikes hit targets in Syria and the national security spokesman [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  Sounding the alarm on the Iran threat and the nation's close ties to another top US adversary watch this [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=272.92s)]
*  Iran is seeking to purchase additional military equipment from Russia including attack helicopters radars and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=280.92s)]
*  combat trainer aircraft [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=287.56s)]
*  In total Iran is seeking billions of dollars worth of military equipment from Russia to strengthen its military capabilities [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  Russia has also been helping Iran develop and maintain its satellite collection capabilities and other space-based programs yet again Iran is [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  Financing and is behind more than one war here [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=306.56s)]
*  Obviously, it's been fueling the war behind Russia and now it's fueling the enemy against Israel and the US [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  When when our targets are our US military doesn't seem to be fighting back full force [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=317.48s)]
*  Are we appearing to be weak in the eyes of Iran and should this administration be taking a stronger stance? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=323.08000000000004s)]
*  Well without a doubt the United States appears weak for the last two years [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=330.04s)]
*  I mean these attacks have been going on without in an effective response [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think general keen earlier was on programs at Fox News [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=338.48s)]
*  Echo his statement that this is too little these are still little pinpricks for every one of these attacks [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=343.4s)]
*  And they have yet to really go after the commanding control of these [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria and until they do that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  It's just gonna continue and we've been lucky that we have not seen more casualties on the US side as far as [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=355.4s)]
*  Admiral Kirby's comments about Iran buying Russian equipment troubling it. It's definitely troubling [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ZJvwlKK4I&t=361.71999999999997s)]
