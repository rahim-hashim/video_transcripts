# This is a 'total gift' to Putin: Dan Senor
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE)
*  Dan Seenor's former foreign policy advisor, excuse me, and the president George W. Bush, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=0.0s)]
*  author of the new book, The Genius of Israel, that just got an amazing review I saw. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=5.0s)]
*  So congratulations on that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=9.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=10.64s)]
*  Okay, there's lots to get to, and you're here for a good reason. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=11.64s)]
*  So Jonathan Hunt talking about the protests in the West Bank. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=13.48s)]
*  You said while it was playing, you said this is a big deal so that our viewers understand [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=16.52s)]
*  why. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=20.88s)]
*  Because the big fear in Jerusalem is this turns quickly from a one-front war to a potential [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=22.12s)]
*  three-front war. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=27.52s)]
*  We obviously have the ground incursion in Gaza right now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=29.0s)]
*  By last count, as of last night, there were 19 IDF soldiers and officers that had been [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=32.28s)]
*  killed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=36.68s)]
*  The fighting there is going to continue. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=37.68s)]
*  It's going to deepen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=39.84s)]
*  The IDF is going to get deeper and deeper into Gaza. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=41.08s)]
*  You got Nasrallah speaking, the head of Hezbollah speaking. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=44.1s)]
*  We don't know what that's about, but it's probably not a good thing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=48.24s)]
*  So Hezbollah probably wants to escalate. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=51.0s)]
*  We can see how much they want to escalate, but that's on the northern front. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=53.1s)]
*  Keep in mind that Hezbollah has 10 times the manpower of Hamas and at least 10 times the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=56.239999999999995s)]
*  military capabilities. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=61.32s)]
*  And they've spent the last few years fighting in the civil war in Syria, so they're actually [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  well-trained. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=66.28s)]
*  They're much better trained than Hamas's. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=67.28s)]
*  They've gotten real on-the-ground training. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=68.56s)]
*  And then you've got some radicalization in the West Bank that Mike Tobin was talking [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  about, which again, smaller than the Hamas threat and smaller than the Hezbollah threat, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=74.28s)]
*  but it certainly feels like a big threat if Israel's now suddenly dealing with fronts [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=79.96s)]
*  all around it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=84.0s)]
*  North, south, and then in the West Bank. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=85.16s)]
*  So we wait to see really what Hezbollah does. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=86.88s)]
*  We wait to see what signal Iran gives to them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=89.8s)]
*  And by extension, Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=93.2s)]
*  Wall Street Journal writes today, call for number four, guys, the Iran-Russian military [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=96.0s)]
*  axis. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=99.96s)]
*  The two countries are increasingly working together against U.S. allies and interests. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=100.96s)]
*  There's a suggestion the SA-22, which is an air defense system which has been operating [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=106.6s)]
*  for several years, could be given to Hezbollah. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=113.0s)]
*  And the reason you would do that is to take on the fighter jets from Israel if that northern [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=116.08s)]
*  front gets hot. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=120.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=121.72s)]
*  So again, it's just important to take a step back and understand the three powers that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=122.72s)]
*  are at work here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=126.28s)]
*  There are three threats. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=127.28s)]
*  There are China, Russia, and Iran. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=128.28s)]
*  And we used to believe that they were all threats to Israel in the West. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=131.0s)]
*  Their interests were aligned, but we weren't sure how much direct coordination there was. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=135.32s)]
*  Now we're seeing, based on what you just cited, is real direct coordination. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=140.56s)]
*  And it filters down not just between Tehran, Beijing, and Moscow, but with the actual proxy [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=144.32s)]
*  militaries like Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  So in the last couple of days, one of the leaders of the Quds Force, of the Iranian [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=152.16s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Corps, was in southern Lebanon meeting with Hezbollah. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=155.72s)]
*  So there's Iran officials getting ready in advance of Nasrallah's speech. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=160.28s)]
*  Khaled Mashal, who's a leader of Hamas, says, you know, the war we launched against Israel [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=164.44s)]
*  on October 7th is good for Russia because it distracts the West from the Russian Ukraine. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  Which is, just to make a fine point on that, which is precisely what Vladimir Putin would want. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=175.2s)]
*  This is a total gift to him. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=180.83999999999997s)]
*  The whole world is fixated on Israel-Gaza and potentially Israel and other fronts, and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  now we're all paying less attention to what he's doing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  And Beijing is more, you know, they've got military assets in the Middle East too. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=189.48s)]
*  So the idea that this all happens coincidentally is preposterous. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=193.83999999999997s)]
*  There's real coordination going on here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=198.68s)]
*  So, Antony Blinken is going to take some questions. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=200.12s)]
*  He's our Secretary of State. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  He's there in Israel, back again. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  What would you ask him or what would you like to hear from him today? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=207.28s)]
*  Because now we have, because of a heckler, a new policy about a possible pause. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=210.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=214.96s)]
*  The question for Secretary Blinken, to me, is very simple. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=215.96s)]
*  Has U.S. policy changed with regard to Israel, supporting Israel in its efforts to eradicate [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=220.0s)]
*  Hamas? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=227.08s)]
*  If the answer is yes, then Israel is in a war. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  There's no ceasefire in a war. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=232.52s)]
*  There was a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel on October 6th. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=235.32000000000002s)]
*  It ended on October 7th. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=238.3s)]
*  Israel is now in a war. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  If you believe Israel has to eradicate Hamas, tragically, as the U.S. knows all too well [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=241.32000000000002s)]
*  from our wars against ISIS all the way back to our wars in World War II, when we firebombed [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  Tokyo, there were 100,000 people killed, civilians, in March of 1945. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=250.56s)]
*  This is what happens in a war, tragically. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=256.7s)]
*  It's not a war that Israel started. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  So if the U.S. position is to stand by Israel as it seeks to eradicate Hamas, a genocidal [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=260.97999999999996s)]
*  threat on its southern border, then it means stand with Israel as it tries to eradicate [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=266.7s)]
*  Hamas, not try to micromanage the war for Israel. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=271.53999999999996s)]
*  Complicated stuff. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=275.62s)]
*  It's good to have you on, Dan. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=276.62s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=277.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=278.62s)]
*  Dan Sinor with a lot of experience in the region. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjmM0BZrBE&t=279.62s)]
