# Netanyahu hammers UN official: This is hogwash
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8)
*  Israel's war on Hamas terrorist grinds on Gaza's largest hospital now at the center of that battle and it has caused [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=0.0s)]
*  thousands of Palestinians to flee for their lives their own people living amongst them the Hamas terrorists [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=7.76s)]
*  Put them in harm's way [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  innocent patients are [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=17.72s)]
*  Still inside some of these buildings and the IDF is now trying to help them get out [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=20.12s)]
*  Here's what's been posted a video saying our troops risk their lives to hand deliver 300 liters of fuel to the hospital [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=25.64s)]
*  For urgent medical purposes Hamas forbade the hospital from taking it [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=33.28s)]
*  The United Nations human rights chief claims both Israel and Hamas have committed war war crimes [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  Israel's prime minister clap back [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=45.2s)]
*  What the commissioner said is hogwash because we're the main differences [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=48.56s)]
*  Are you deliberately targeting civilians? No, we're deliberately doing everything everything in our power to target the terrorists [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=53.44s)]
*  That's clearly what Israel is doing and what clearly Hamas is doing is the opposite [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  I think any civilian loss is a tragedy and it should the blame should be placed squarely on Hamas [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  All right [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=71.92s)]
*  Let's go to the northern part of the country now the border between Israel and Lebanon and and this is interesting to note today [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=72.6s)]
*  I've been asking is this now officially becoming a second front of the war [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=79.76s)]
*  So Israel's northern border with Lebanon Hezbollah terrorists launched missiles yesterday [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=84.12s)]
*  Injuring several Israeli civilians. It was the most violent day there since the start of the war [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=90.44s)]
*  Alex Hogan is in northern Israel now Alex [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=96.08s)]
*  Hi, Harris the country's defense minister traveled to this part of the country warning Hezbollah that if it continues with these [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=100.4s)]
*  Escalations and these attacks that the IDF could do to be root what the IDF has already done to Gaza [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=107.28s)]
*  So very strong words here, but there is a lot of tension on the ground, especially as these incoming airstrikes here continue [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah is more as a more developed, you know [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  Military they developed a warfare since the last war all the rockets and launchers and basically all the military abilities they have [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=125.92000000000002s)]
*  We're with the IDF in northern Israel [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=133.76s)]
*  These were all fields converted into ammunition spaces targeting Hezbollah sites on the other side of the border and Lebanon [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=136.12s)]
*  This has become the most deadly conflict here on the northern border of Israel and Lebanon since [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  2006 for the safety of these soldiers this location is undisclosed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=149.56s)]
*  But the IDF says in the air fighter jets are striking Hezbollah weapons compounds and infrastructure and on the ground [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  These troops are constantly watching the horizon for cross-border attacks [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=159.04s)]
*  It has been lies a different story than Hamas in the southern border [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  a 38 of the war in Gaza the IDF says that it's found new Hamas bases in a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  University and a mosque the main focus remains under the area's largest hospital there [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=172.76s)]
*  The World Health Organization is warning that electricity has been out for days and we're hearing that in the last three days [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=177.92s)]
*  32 patients in that hospital have died including three NICU babies world leaders and other countries are pledging to send ships [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=184.62s)]
*  to this part of the world as [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=192.88s)]
*  Makeshift hospitals just off of the shore and we're learning that the very first one a ship from Turkey carrying medical equipment [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=196.02s)]
*  Has now arrived at the Rava crossing on the Egyptian side Harris [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=202.46s)]
*  Almost 40 days in and and finally some help arriving from around from other Arab nations around the Middle East [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=207.86s)]
*  Thank you very much in focus now retired Navy captain Brent Sadler former Pentagon official now a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=214.74s)]
*  Want to tick down a lot of points with you today. Welcome to the program. First of all, is it fair now to start asking about a potential? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=222.82s)]
*  Second front to the north in Israel as they fight Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=230.86s)]
*  Well, I think that second front's been active fairly early on this this conflict with Hamas [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=237.86s)]
*  So it's not a new front but I but clearly Hamas has not unleashed the full weight of its missile [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=242.82s)]
*  Arsenal yet has well and that actually could [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=249.22s)]
*  Really ratched up the pressure on Israel and their armory for defenses. Yeah [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  You had said Hamas. I'm just thinking Hezbollah [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=257.54s)]
*  Hmm, yeah, and and what is their capability actually? I know it's north of a hundred and fifty thousand missiles and and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=261.18s)]
*  They're already targeting Israeli civilians. Are is there some sort of coordination? Do you think now between Hamas and Hezbollah? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=268.38s)]
*  Well, it's no secret [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  They've actually met both Hamas and Hezbollah have met in the in the months and weeks leading up to this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=277.21999999999997s)]
*  Attack in October 7th and they continue to coordinate today [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=282.5s)]
*  So I think it's fair to assume that there is coordination that's ongoing and I would add to that mix the Iranians themselves the IGRC [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=285.68s)]
*  specifically [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=293.36s)]
*  But of course the number of weapons the missiles that Hezbollah has if you add into what's already been used to defend against [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=294.6s)]
*  Those attacks from Hamas it runs the real risk of Israel running out of its munition in what we call the Navy going going [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=301.72s)]
*  Winchester if that happens then Israel has less ability to defend against these attacks and it's Hezbollah that has the ability to basically [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=308.4s)]
*  Deplete those defenses well and and while we still haven't been able to move with [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  Sending more aid within the house on the hill Capitol Hill. They got to get it together. All right, here we go [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=320.16s)]
*  We're fighting now against us against our men and women stationed in the region [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=326.2s)]
*  And if we pop up that map you'll be able to see just how many areas that the enemy can target the Wall Street Journal [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=331.12s)]
*  editorial board with this headline Iran is not impressed by US airstrikes talking about those [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  Retaliatory airstrikes they've hit us 52 times. We've hit them three times [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=342.62s)]
*  And written before this latest strike a quote Iran's militias try to kill Americans and the US targets [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=347.46s)]
*  Ammo dumps, is that fair? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=355.42s)]
*  Absolutely, I think general Keane said it right at this stage simply just posturing and giving words and through diplomacy is not enough [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=358.62s)]
*  To actually stop these attacks [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=365.9s)]
*  It hasn't stopped these attacks and just doing one or two pinprick on either empty buildings or a place where you may have a small [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=367.46s)]
*  Gathering of some of these proxy forces is not enough [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=374.42s)]
*  You have to hit more widespread you have to go after the leadership and I think senator Warner's off base or at least is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=377.78s)]
*  Getting it wrong. It's not simply the positioning of a carrier strike group in a SSG in [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=383.58s)]
*  submarine with [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=389.38s)]
*  154 Tomahawk cruise missiles that deters [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=390.74s)]
*  It's actually the willingness to use it and this administration needs to show that it's willing to use its full force to deter further [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=393.3s)]
*  Attacks I get more confused every time I hear some of these people talk [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=400.42s)]
*  Secretary Lloyd Austin says we will do what is necessary to protect our troops and then they don't do that real quickly [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=403.5s)]
*  Nine Americans a three-year-old among them the hostages your quick thoughts [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=409.38s)]
*  No, I think Americans need to remember that Hamas has killed also [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=415.06s)]
*  Dozens of Americans in their October 7th attack and currently are holding those nine and perhaps a tenth [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=418.5s)]
*  If you add in the green card holder, that's also in the count [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=425.38s)]
*  We pray for their release and that they're okay right now Brent Sadler. Thank you very much [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZKZJdJyQ8&t=429.73999999999995s)]
