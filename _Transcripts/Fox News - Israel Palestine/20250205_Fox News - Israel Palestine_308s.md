# Ex-national security official: We need to break the paradigm in Gaza
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs)
*  Joining me now is Victoria Coats, former Trump deputy national security adviser. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=0.0s)]
*  Victoria, this has been another day of just nonstop news. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=4.72s)]
*  Your reaction to the president's proposal that the U.S. essentially take over the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=10.8s)]
*  Well, Laura, good to be with you. Now, it's been another momentous day in, I would say, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=19.76s)]
*  the most momentous first two weeks of any president's tenure. And today we heard President [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=24.479999999999997s)]
*  Trump come out and say what no American leader has had the courage to say before, which is that the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  United States is willing to step in here and play the leadership role we need to play. The situation [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=36.72s)]
*  in Gaza is untenable. What happened on October 7th of 2023 cannot happen again. And the only way to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=42.4s)]
*  ensure that is to break the paradigm, to create a new mold. And I think that's what he was proposing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=49.92s)]
*  today in concert with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Great to see them together again at the White [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  House. And last time they came together and had some of these discussions, we got the Abraham Accords. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=61.84s)]
*  So I think this is a great way to get the conversation going. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=67.84s)]
*  And people have to remember that the Palestinian control of the Gaza Strip is a recent phenomenon. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=70.88s)]
*  People who aren't steeped in the history of the Middle East, as tumultuous as it is, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=79.19999999999999s)]
*  and may think that, well, how can you do this? This is a homeland going back. Well, no, this was [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=83.91999999999999s)]
*  recently administered as under the authority of the Palestinian Authority. But that stemmed [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=90.88s)]
*  ultimately from the Oslo Accords, Victoria. And we can see that, unfortunately, it has been an abysmal [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=97.36s)]
*  failure. And Trump doesn't like to see parts of the world failing, that America has sent billions [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=106.0s)]
*  and billions of dollars to, either directly or indirectly. And this is really ground zero for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=112.0s)]
*  utter failure and destruction. No, that has been, I mean, failure is the word. For the last 50 years, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=117.84s)]
*  Laura, we've been trying to make the Palestinians into something that they're not, which is a nation [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=125.68s)]
*  state. And until they build institutions, until they build institutional memory, this simply isn't [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=130.32s)]
*  going to work. So reporters insisting that the president embrace a two-state solution, this has [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  failed for half a century. And so I think what he is saying is we will not go down this path again. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  And the same people who told us that we couldn't get to peace deals between Israel and Muslim [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  neighbors until we got to a Palestinian deal 10 years ago, they were wrong. These people are [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=156.4s)]
*  wrong, too. And it has always been my hope there may be some Palestinians who say, hey, this is a [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=162.08s)]
*  good deal. The president is a businessman. He's a real estate guy. He knows a great piece of land [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=168.4s)]
*  when he sees it. Maybe we can build something here, and maybe we can get some of those institutions. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=174.24s)]
*  But they don't have them now, and pretending that they do will just lead us to another round of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=180.0s)]
*  failure. But you can hear the chorus of criticism. It began earlier today and it's continued all day [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=184.56s)]
*  long that this is just Trump's world to remake and shape as he sees fit. Let's listen. President Trump [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=192.16s)]
*  was essentially parroting talking points straight out of a right-wing Israeli playbook. An alarming [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=201.2s)]
*  escalation in the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. And that's precisely what the U.S. president is [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=207.76s)]
*  doing in all of this rhetoric. This is the president who says outrageous things because he [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=212.56s)]
*  thinks it always will result in a deal. I'm not sure that works as well in the Middle East. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=217.68s)]
*  Well, that's not at all what he said. In fact, what he just said was this would be primarily [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=224.08s)]
*  when rebuilt, the place where Palestinians would love to live because it would be finally [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=229.04s)]
*  safe and not a launching pad for more terror attacks. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=235.44s)]
*  And interestingly, those were some of the same characters who in 2017, when the president made [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=239.04s)]
*  the announcement about the move of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, were insisting [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=244.32s)]
*  that the sky was going to fall and the streets were going to run with blood and Israel didn't [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=249.83999999999997s)]
*  want this to happen and would be attacked. And again, these are talking points from the far [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=253.92s)]
*  Israeli right. Well, that didn't turn out to be the case. Ambassador Friedman and President Trump [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=258.8s)]
*  and Jared Kushner moved that embassy at warp speed. And there was peace in Jerusalem that day. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=264.16s)]
*  Now CNN, which you showed, showed riots in Gaza miles and miles away. But Jerusalem was at peace [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=272.8s)]
*  that day. It was a great day for Jerusalem. It was a day of truth. And I think that's what today was [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=279.44000000000005s)]
*  at the White House. And as you say, what President Trump is offering the Palestinians is what he has [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=284.72s)]
*  always offered them. Peace through prosperity. He wants them to have a better future. It's theirs to take. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=290.4s)]
*  All right, Victoria, thanks so much. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBy7Gc94Rxs&t=296.56s)]
