# Gen Jack Keane: Hamas will declare victory if this happens
**Fox News - Israel Palestine:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI)
*  Jackie is a Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, Chairman of the Institute for the Study of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=0.0s)]
*  War. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=3.72s)]
*  Great to have you here, sir. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=4.72s)]
*  I want to show you two things, because there was some possibility, or we heard that there's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=5.72s)]
*  discussions about possible hostage releases. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=10.16s)]
*  Two possibilities, they're saying the first one would be three to five days of no fighting, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  and Hamas would release 50 women and children on day one. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=18.88s)]
*  Israel releases a similar number of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, so that would be [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=22.76s)]
*  the first set. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=26.32s)]
*  The second would be that Hamas would release 10 more hostages each day of ceasefire when [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=27.44s)]
*  hostages release, I'm sorry, when hostage release stops, then the ceasefire stops. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  And that would also mean Israel allows more amounts, large amounts of fuel and trucks [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=37.0s)]
*  into Gaza. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=41.2s)]
*  So those are the two possibilities. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=42.2s)]
*  The administration's saying they're cautious, they're not saying it's happening right away, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=44.08s)]
*  but they're thinking that they want to get this done. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=48.56s)]
*  What do you know? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=51.52s)]
*  Well, certainly I think there's something here is going to happen. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=53.6s)]
*  They're working out the final terms of it, and obviously we're not privy to what the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=58.2s)]
*  differences are. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=61.52s)]
*  But we knew from the outset that Hamas did something very different here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=63.02s)]
*  One, they attacked the civilian population on October the 7th, which was their primary [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=67.12s)]
*  attack versus the IDF, which has been the case in the past, and two, they took significant [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=71.48s)]
*  amount of hostages as part of their plan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=76.56s)]
*  And we speculated that the reason for the hostages was that they would use them in tranches [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=80.22s)]
*  to be able to release them to get ceasefire so that they can rearm, reequip and move their [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=85.94s)]
*  people out of harm's way, and also keep sufficient number of hostages to make certain that the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=92.4s)]
*  regime survives. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=99.9s)]
*  Remember, the military task assigned by Israel's national authority is to dismantle Hamas, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=101.62s)]
*  and that's what they are attempting to do as a military and terrorist organization's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=109.58s)]
*  effectiveness, their entire network, and also as a governing body. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=113.86s)]
*  That is a tall task, and obviously Hamas absolutely sees one of the things that they want out [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=118.6s)]
*  of this is to preserve the regime. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=125.46s)]
*  If they're able to preserve their regime, they will declare victory, that everything [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=127.5s)]
*  that they lost was absolutely worth it, because they got widespread condemnation of Israel [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=132.32s)]
*  in the international community, some geopolitical isolation of it, and they believe weakening [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=138.10000000000002s)]
*  of the Israeli government in terms of its inability to respond effectively to their [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=143.54000000000002s)]
*  attack. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=148.9s)]
*  So the stakes are very high here for the Israelis, and it is a formidable challenge what they're [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=149.94s)]
*  up against. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=155.9s)]
*  General, I mean, your first answer surprised me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=156.9s)]
*  You have optimism that this can work. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=159.88s)]
*  You know, I see two sides who just flat out don't trust each other. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=162.34s)]
*  I see an act of war. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=165.9s)]
*  I see both sides want destruction of the other, and we've yet to see significant signs that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=167.7s)]
*  there is proof of life for so many of these hostages, and that's just where I'm left to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=173.34s)]
*  think about. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=179.1s)]
*  I want to be optimistic. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=181.42s)]
*  Well, I think- I mean, give us some hope that I'm wrong and you're right. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=183.22s)]
*  Well, I would suspect the Israelis have asked for proof of life. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=191.1s)]
*  We just, they're not going to show it to us. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=195.22s)]
*  These are classified secret negotiations that have taken place. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=197.28s)]
*  They've got- I'm assuming they do have some evidence of that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=201.2s)]
*  This is going to happen, in my judgment, because it's in the interest of both parties, and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=206.16s)]
*  that's the obvious one. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=211.16s)]
*  As I mentioned, Hamas needs this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=213.36s)]
*  What is happening here on the ground, so our audience understands, Israel is clearing northern [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=215.64s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=221.28s)]
*  They have to move to the eastern part of Gaza to finish it and deal with the tunnel complex. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=222.28s)]
*  What Hamas has been doing, they have not been defending. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=227.0s)]
*  They have been delaying actions, and that's, in military terms, trading space for time. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=230.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=237.4s)]
*  To preserve their force. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=238.4s)]
*  A lot of their force has their leaders, and a lot of their fighters have already moved [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=239.4s)]
*  south, where there will be a pending humanitarian crisis, given the concentration of people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=244.52s)]
*  Plus, obviously, a very intense combat operations being conducted there. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=251.0s)]
*  That is what I mean about the challenges that the Israelis are facing here. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=257.28s)]
*  It's in their interest to get the hostages back, and Hamas knows that, and it's in Hamas's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=261.54s)]
*  interest to buy some more time, and I think at some point that compromise will be made. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=268.0s)]
*  Hope you're right, General. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=273.48s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=275.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=276.24s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=277.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=278.24s)]
*  Jack Keane, thanks. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbJFGOf8BxI&t=279.24s)]
