Video Description: Comments to the media by Danny Danon, Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations, on the situation in the Middle East.

------------------------

Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon today (1 Oct) told reporters in New York that Israel’s response to a barrage of ballistic missiles launched by Iran on Israeli territory, “will be noticed” and “it will be painful.”

Danon said, “the Islamic regime in Iran has now shown the world its true face. They are a terrorist state. For years they have armed terrorist and rogue states. They are responsible for the death of innocent civilians across the globe.”

Until now, he said, “they have hidden behind proxies, but the mask has dropped. They have exposed themselves directly, launching hundreds of missiles into civilian areas. Their evil is now laid bare for all to see.”

The Israeli diplomat vowed to “defend our people.” He said, “we will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions.”

Danon expressed disappointment at Secretary-General António Guterres’ message issued after the Iranian attacks calling for de-escalation and stressing the need for a ceasefire.

He said, “we have no desire for war or escalation. But we cannot sit idly by when our civilians are being attacked in such manner.”

Asked about specific plans for Israel's response, he said, “we will decide about when and how we will respond” an added, “the people of Iran who are watching us understand that it's not against the Iranian people. It's against the radical regime that dragged the Iranian people into this situation.”

*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=25.28s)]
*  Just hours ago, the Iranian regime launched an unprecedented assault on Israel, launching [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=27.04s)]
*  close to 200 ballistic missiles at our civilian population. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=33.32s)]
*  An attack on this scale has not been seen since the blitz of London. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=38.879999999999995s)]

*  The Islamic regime in Iran has now shown the world its true face. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=59.0s)]

*  For years, they have armed terrorists and rogue states. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=66.88s)]
*  They are responsible for the deaths of innocent civilians across the globe, from Europe's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=70.88s)]
*  war zones to terror attacks in the Middle East, from embassies in Latin America to assault [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=76.52s)]
*  on U.S. personnel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=83.6s)]
*  Iran's blood-stained fingerprints are everywhere. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=85.76s)]
*  Until now, they have hidden behind proxies, but the mask has dropped. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=89.96s)]
*  They have exposed themselves, directly launching hundreds of missiles into civilian areas. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=96.16s)]
*  Their evil is now laid bare for all to see. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=103.52s)]
*  I have called for an emergency session of the Security Council to convene as soon as [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=108.68s)]
*  possible to discuss this unprecedented attack and to issue a clear, unequivocal condemnation [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=114.68s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=122.44s)]
*  Let me be very clear. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=123.44s)]
*  We will defend our people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=125.68s)]
*  We will act. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=128.56s)]
*  Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=130.44s)]
*  The response will be painful. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=135.68s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. Ambassador Edith Lettera from the Associated Press. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=138.68s)]
*  The Secretary General has called for a halt to these escalating attacks between Israel [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=150.88s)]
*  and Iran and its proxies. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=160.88s)]
*  There is widespread concern about this conflict spreading throughout the Middle East and drawing [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=165.08s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=176.0s)]
*  Is this a concern of Israel and how are you addressing these fears? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=179.0s)]
*  First of all, I will tell you frankly, Edith, that I am very disappointed from the reaction [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  of the Secretary General. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=191.08s)]
*  Few hours after such a vicious attack and the statement he put out basically ignores [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=193.24s)]
*  the aggressor and speaks about de-escalation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  But we have a member state of the United Nations that just came to this building a few days [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=203.36s)]
*  ago and they sent ballistic missiles to another sovereign state and instead of condemning [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=208.0s)]
*  them some people call for de-escalation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=213.72000000000003s)]
*  That's disappointing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=217.08s)]
*  We have no desire for war or escalation, but we cannot sit idly by when our civilians [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=218.92s)]
*  are being attacked in such manner. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=226.0s)]
*  And as I said earlier, Iran used to send proxies, but now when they send almost 200 ballistic [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  missiles, that's something that I don't think any other nation in the world will ignore. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=235.76s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, just a quick follow-up. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=241.76s)]
*  Iran has put out a statement saying that if Israel responds, they will respond even more [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=245.8s)]
*  seriously. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think I would not advise Iran to challenge our determination, our capabilities. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  In the past we have proved it and we will prove it again. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=264.88s)]
*  Ambassador, Michelle Nichols from Reuters, could you give us any indication of how Israel [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=267.8s)]
*  might respond to this attack? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=272.76s)]
*  Are Iran's nuclear facilities on the table in terms of a target? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=275.12s)]
*  So we will decide about when and how we will respond, but I can tell you one thing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=279.88s)]
*  It will be noticed. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=286.88s)]
*  It will be painful. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=288.4s)]
*  And I think that the people of Iran who are watching us understand that it's not against [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  the Iranian people, it's against the radical regime that dragged the Iranian people into [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  this situation. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=300.92s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=302.44s)]
*  Gabriel Elizondo from Al Jazeera English. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=304.44s)]
*  Ambassador, at the very podium that you're at now, just a few days ago, Ayman Safadi, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  the Foreign Minister of Jordan, stood at the very podium there and he said, on behalf of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=312.28s)]
*  57 Arab and Muslim countries, they are willing to provide safety or help provide safety to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=316.88s)]
*  Israel, safety and security to Israel, your country, if for long-term... [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  If Israel... [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=329.16s)]
*  Should I go ahead? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=335.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=336.16s)]
*  If Israel ends their occupation and really pursues an independent state for the Palestinian [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=337.16s)]
*  people, they are willing to work with you towards peace. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  And he said from that podium, asking the Israeli official, what is their long-term plan for [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  peace other than what you're doing in Lebanon and what's happening in Gaza? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=352.0s)]
*  So I ask you, sir, what is Israel's long-term plan for peace? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=357.0s)]
*  I appreciate the sincerity of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and we have peace treaty [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=362.0s)]
*  with Jordan, but when you look at what's happening today in our neighborhood, attacks from Lebanon, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=368.16s)]
*  attacks from Yemen, attacks from Iran, every Israeli asks himself today, who is my partner? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=373.64s)]
*  And unfortunately, today the leadership of the Palestinian Authority are not capable [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=380.32s)]
*  of proving themselves as partner for peace. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=385.44s)]
*  You know, they haven't condemned Hamas. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=388.44s)]
*  President Abbas spoke in the General Assembly for half an hour, ignored the atrocities in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=390.44s)]
*  Hamas completely. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  He never mentioned Hamas. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=395.71999999999997s)]
*  So I think once there will be a genuine leader among the Palestinians who is serious and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=397.71999999999997s)]
*  sincere about his intentions, he will find the Israelis sitting there willing to negotiate [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=403.0s)]
*  peace. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=409.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, it is not the case today. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=410.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCSWXUY-dWo&t=413.0s)]
