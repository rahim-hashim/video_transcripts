# (EN/FR) France on Gaza - Security Council Media Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs)
*  Hello. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=0.0s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=11.36s)]
*  As you know, the Security Council will hold at 3.30 an emergency session to discuss the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=13.88s)]
*  latest developments in Raqqa and in Ghadha. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=20.64s)]
*  I think this meeting is necessary. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=23.96s)]
*  It's timely and France pushed a lot to have this exchange. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=26.96s)]
*  I will just have three points today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=33.28s)]
*  First, as President Macron recalled yesterday, there must be an immediate ceasefire in Ghadha [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=35.4s)]
*  and the unconditional release of the hostages. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=42.2s)]
*  There is no safe zone for Palestinian civilians in Raqqa. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=45.6s)]
*  President Macron has expressed his indignation at the Israeli strikes, which have claimed [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=50.84s)]
*  many victims among the displaced persons in Raqqa yesterday. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=56.36s)]
*  Another strike against a camp killed civilians this morning as well. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=60.96s)]
*  These Israeli operations must stop immediately, as requested by the International Court of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=65.72s)]
*  Justice. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=72.16s)]
*  At the same time, we also call on Palestinian armed groups to cease their rocket attacks [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=73.16s)]
*  on Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=79.6s)]
*  My second point is on the humanitarian situation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=81.1s)]
*  Aid must enter Raqqa on a massive scale, through as many crossing points as possible. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=85.56s)]
*  The needs are huge, and the UN has warned us clear against the difficulties of access. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=92.76s)]
*  The distribution of aid via land routes must be the priority, even if the operationization [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=99.04s)]
*  of the maritime corridor is good news. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=106.4s)]
*  Finally, the Security Council must fulfill its mandate and take action now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=109.68s)]
*  It must allow the UN to play its full role in the Gaza Strip in order to cover the immediate [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  needs of the population. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  It must enable the Palestinians to govern the Gaza Strip that will be an integral part [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=124.2s)]
*  of their state. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=130.2s)]
*  Otherwise, we will continue to go from one crisis to the other. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=131.84s)]
*  France will remain committed to building a state for the Palestinians and security guarantees [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  for Israel. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=142.28s)]
*  It's high time for this Council to take action and to adopt a new resolution. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=143.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=148.56s)]
*  Ambassador, how are negotiations going on the French draft? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=149.56s)]
*  I think you know the French draft is covering the short term, the mid term, the long term. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=153.32s)]
*  So I think we will continue to discuss on this draft to give the Security Council the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=159.24s)]
*  possibility to frame a political solution. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=165.52s)]
*  What we are talking about now is the emergency situation in Raqqa after yesterday's bombing, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=169.88s)]
*  indiscriminate bombings, and how to make sure that it stops. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=178.2s)]
*  So I think what I was referring to is action by the Security Council to put a stop on the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=181.52s)]
*  military actions in Raqqa and just to implement or to contribute to implement what the international [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=188.56s)]
*  Court of Justice has been asking for at the end of last week. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=195.44000000000003s)]
*  This is a matter of life and death. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  This is a matter of emergency. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=203.04000000000002s)]
*  We will discuss that this afternoon. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  We'll see where we are. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=209.28s)]
*  But I think the Security Council cannot just talk. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=210.76000000000002s)]
*  The Security Council needs to act. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=214.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  For now, that's what I just explained in English. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=225.36s)]
*  What we need is a decision on the situation in Raqqa. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  There was this attack yesterday that killed dozens of people. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=245.68s)]
*  We are talking about a bombings, a camp to move. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=250.56s)]
*  We are risk, mechanically, to go from an incident of this type to other incidents of this type. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=255.04s)]
*  It will continue. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  The civil populations in Raqqa are not in a safe zone. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  The situation is terrible on the security level, on the humanitarian level. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=266.4s)]
*  So it is absolutely essential that the operation in progress stops and that we give priority [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  to the civilians. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=279.32s)]
*  Are you ready? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=281.08s)]
*  Is France ready to put another resolution on the table, in addition to the one that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=282.08s)]
*  is already there? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=286.48s)]
*  We will discuss this at the Security Council with the other members. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=287.48s)]
*  You know, we are 15, so we have to agree. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=290.68s)]
*  We need to find a compromise with the 14 other countries. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=293.12s)]
*  Can we imagine a Franco-Algerian resolution? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  We can imagine everything. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=302.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=304.0s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, a question about universal jurisdiction. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=305.68s)]
*  Assad regime and key members in his security apparatus are now facing trial in France since [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=310.48s)]
*  last week. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=317.6s)]
*  Universal... [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=318.6s)]
*  I will not comment on that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=319.6s)]
*  I know there are trials in France. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=323.08s)]
*  We have an independent justice. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=326.28s)]
*  And I will just trust the French judges. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=328.52s)]
*  I'm sure they will make the right decisions. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr_5coiTENs&t=333.6s)]
