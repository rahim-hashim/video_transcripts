Video Description: In a briefing from Gaza, WHO’s Dr. Peppercorn underscores the urgent need for a polio vaccination campaign targeting nearly 600,000 children under ten. Despite restricted access and evacuations, the campaign has reached many children with support from local health workers and international partners. While forced displacement has unexpectedly increased access, key northern areas remain out of reach. Dr. Peppercorn emphasizes that sustained access is essential to fully protect Gaza’s young population amidst the ongoing crisis.

# Polio Campaign in Gaza | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333hH9DvsHY)
*  We are ready. We need regular access, properly supported and facilitated. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333hH9DvsHY&t=0.0s)]
*  The Polio Campaign is one key activity. It's about a broader health sector, basic health service, referral health service. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333hH9DvsHY&t=7.0s)]
*  How do we make sure that the health system in Gaza remains functional? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333hH9DvsHY&t=15.0s)]
*  So the campaign aimed to vaccinate an estimated 592,000 children, almost, under 10 years of age, with a second dose of the novel oral polio vaccine type 2. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333hH9DvsHY&t=22.0s)]
*  So the target for the North is 190,000 children. And after the first two days, we already covered almost 94,500 children under 10 with polio, which is almost 79% of the target. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333hH9DvsHY&t=34.0s)]
*  The shelter conditions for all those people, by the way, are incredibly basic. So much more is needed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333hH9DvsHY&t=51.0s)]
*  Gaza has a lot of fantastic health workers, very well educated and incredibly capable. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333hH9DvsHY&t=62.0s)]
*  And the health service before this crisis, I don't say they were perfect, but they're relatively good, including some of the public health services, vaccination coverage over 90%. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333hH9DvsHY&t=70.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of capacity and we have to make sure that we facilitate and support that as good as possible. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=333hH9DvsHY&t=80.0s)]
