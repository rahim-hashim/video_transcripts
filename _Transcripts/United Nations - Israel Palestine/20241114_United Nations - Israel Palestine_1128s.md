# Interview: Philippe Lazzarini (UNRWA) on Gaza & Lebanon as well as the future of the agency
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8)
*  We're joined today by Commissioner General Filippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=0.0s)]
*  United Nations Palestinian Relief Agency, and we're live from UN headquarters in New [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=5.76s)]
*  York. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=11.52s)]
*  Commissioner General, you've described the current situation in Gaza as dystopian, as [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=12.52s)]
*  post-apocalyptic, and yet potentially it could get even worse. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  We're looking at a situation where in January there could be Israeli legislation implemented [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=23.48s)]
*  that would outlaw UNRWA. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=29.2s)]
*  On top of everything else that people in Gaza are suffering, what would this mean for them? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=31.52s)]
*  I did describe the situation as being a dystopian horror. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=36.92s)]
*  I mean, if you listen to our colleagues on the ground, they're telling us stories about [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  people in north of Gaza just waiting to be killed by airstrike, trying to struggle not [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  to die again because of diseases or because of hunger. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=58.44s)]
*  The level of destruction is absolutely unbelievable, and indeed people have been reduced to live [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=63.44s)]
*  in the rubble, in the garbage, in the sewage water, and without any hope of a better future. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=74.28s)]
*  Now in this context, we have an imminent response. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=82.32s)]
*  UNRWA is a backbone of this response, partnered with a number of UN agencies, but would UNRWA [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=87.96s)]
*  have to disappear from Gaza? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=96.0s)]
*  Not only our collective ability to respond to unprecedented need would decrease, but [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=99.11999999999999s)]
*  we would also sacrifice the future generation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=107.76s)]
*  Today, Stephen, we have more than 650,000 girls and boys living in the rubble, deeply [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=112.0s)]
*  traumatized. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  And if you get rid of an agency like UNRWA, who will be in charge to bring them back in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  a learning environment? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=128.96s)]
*  There is absolutely no UN agency geared to provide public-like services, like education [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=130.76s)]
*  at the primary and secondary age. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=140.28s)]
*  That would mean sacrificing an entire generation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=143.64s)]
*  That would also mean that we would plant the seed for more extremism, for more resentment, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  and for more hate in the future. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=156.84s)]
*  So the consequences would definitely be catastrophic. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=159.24s)]
*  For those unaware of what exactly UNRWA does on the ground, not just in Gaza, but in the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  West Bank, in East Jerusalem, Lebanon, and Syria, it goes beyond education, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  What other services do you provide for Palestinian refugees? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=173.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, UNRWA is primarily operating in Lebanon, in Syria, in Jordan, in the West Bank, East [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=176.36s)]
*  Jerusalem, and Gaza. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  We are primarily a human development organization, providing public-like services such as education [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=184.36s)]
*  to more than 550,000 girls and boys across the region. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=193.06s)]
*  We are running 700 schools. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=198.0s)]
*  But we are also providing primary health care to more than 2 million people across the region. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=200.36s)]
*  And only in Gaza today, despite the challenges our staff are confronted with, we are still [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=207.16000000000003s)]
*  providing, on a daily basis, 16,000 consultations. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=214.32s)]
*  How do you do that in times of war, during active combat? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  More than around 90% of Gaza is considered under evacuation orders. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=224.84s)]
*  How do your staff actually operate? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=230.92s)]
*  Are they also on the move, or are you positioned in your traditional centers? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  What is it like on that daily life? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  Our staff is primarily from the community, so basically they endure the same challenges, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=241.32s)]
*  the same suffering, the same tragedy than anyone else in Gaza. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=249.52s)]
*  As you know, people have been on the move constantly. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=254.58s)]
*  They have been kind of pinballs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=259.04s)]
*  Our staff also, being part of the community, has followed the community. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=261.72s)]
*  Our staff also is living in shelters, shelters which, as you know, most of the time have [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=266.32s)]
*  been damaged or even targeted. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=272.56s)]
*  So somehow our strength is that our staff is part of the community. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=275.84s)]
*  And because they are part of the community, because they move with the community, we have [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=280.88s)]
*  this proximity and ability to provide these services. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=284.92s)]
*  There seems to be, on the one hand, some consensus on this. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=289.28s)]
*  The United States has said that UNRWA's mission is critical. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  The Security Council has demanded that it not be disbanded. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=296.08s)]
*  And yet this legislation could pass. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=299.44s)]
*  What actual steps can be taken? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  Who are you talking to here at the United Nations headquarters? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=304.96s)]
*  What can be done, if anything? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=308.28s)]
*  Well I addressed the General Assembly last week. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=310.56s)]
*  I went also to Riyadh for the Global Alliance for the Two-State Solution. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=312.88s)]
*  And my ask to the Member States is very clear. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=318.08s)]
*  First we need to convince the Israeli government to put on hold the implementation of this [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=322.0s)]
*  law. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=328.2s)]
*  And once this is on hold, we need to insert the role of the agency within any possible [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=329.2s)]
*  political pathway leading to a two-state solution, leading to empowered Palestinian institutions. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=338.2s)]
*  In fact, only a functioning state, public institutions, can properly take over the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=347.2s)]
*  activities of UNRWA. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=354.24s)]
*  And if we do not do this, and if in three months' time we stop abruptly all the activities [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=355.68s)]
*  of UNRWA, that would create a vacuum. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=362.03999999999996s)]
*  It's like throwing the baby with the water. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=365.08s)]
*  And if there is a vacuum, how will it be filled? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=367.8s)]
*  Because there is absolutely no ecosystem which likes vacuums. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=371.28s)]
*  And certainly not by anything that Israel or the Palestinians or any of us would like [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=374.8s)]
*  to see. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=380.92s)]
*  Are you taking your case directly to Donald Trump now that he's been elected as the next [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=381.92s)]
*  president of the United States? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=386.6s)]
*  Well the newly elected president has indicated that promoting peace will be a priority. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  I do believe that there cannot be peace without addressing the Palestinian issues, which would [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=396.36s)]
*  mean that if there is a pathway, indeed UNRWA has a positive and important role to play. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=403.98s)]
*  So yes, I will be reaching out in order to ensure or to propose that the agency retrieve [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=410.98s)]
*  in fact its temporary nature. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=420.98s)]
*  We have been a temporary agency for 75 years, but if we are genuinely committed to a political [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=424.34s)]
*  pathway today, we might retrieve the temporary nature of the agency. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=430.18s)]
*  What about with the Israelis? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=435.86s)]
*  Are there direct talks or indirect talks through mediators to press home this point that you've [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=436.86s)]
*  made this week at the UN that if UNRWA has to stand down, ultimately it's up to Israel [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=442.18s)]
*  to take care of the people on the ground in Gaza? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=446.98s)]
*  Yes, ultimately if UNRWA has to end up its activity and UNRWA is a United Nations response [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=449.82s)]
*  to the plight of the Palestinian refugees, UNRWA in reality is a tool of the international [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=458.14s)]
*  community of the UN General Assembly. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=464.34s)]
*  So if UNRWA is dismantled or has to end its activities on demand of one member state, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=468.46s)]
*  that means the owners will shift back on the shoulder of the occupying power being the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=475.94s)]
*  state of Israel and they will have to be the one to provide education and primary health [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=481.7s)]
*  to millions of Palestinians. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=488.1s)]
*  You've said this law is politically motivated. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=490.78000000000003s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=493.06s)]
*  Who could possibly stand to gain from a situation like this? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=494.22s)]
*  We keep hearing that this law has been designed because UNRWA is colluding or infiltrated by [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=498.46s)]
*  Hamas, but we are just a casualty of this law. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=506.46s)]
*  We are a soft target. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=511.46s)]
*  We have been under harsh criticism from Hamas over the last few years because of our education, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=513.46s)]
*  because we were promoting gender equality, because we were organizing summer camp with [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=521.46s)]
*  girls and boys together to promote art, music and sport. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=526.46s)]
*  And there is also in Israel a belief that if you get rid of UNRWA, you will strip the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=534.46s)]
*  Palestinian from the refugee statue and through this you will also undermine the future aspirations [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=542.46s)]
*  of the Palestinian for self-determination. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=550.22s)]
*  In a certain extent, they are unilaterally modifying the parameter for a future solution. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=553.94s)]
*  So, yes, I do believe that the primary reason behind this law, and we heard it from the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=561.94s)]
*  author of the law saying this is one opportunity in a generation to once for all put an end [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=569.22s)]
*  to the refugee statue or to the victimhood that UNRWA might have perpetuated. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=576.82s)]
*  But here again, it's a false argument because even if UNRWA would end its activities, the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=583.62s)]
*  refugee statue will continue. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=592.1s)]
*  The refugee statue is entrained in Resolution 194 of the General Assembly, where the mandate [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=594.18s)]
*  of UNRWA is entrained in a completely different resolution which was adopted later on. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=601.3s)]
*  Let's talk about aid. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=609.3s)]
*  We all know that the Biden administration set an ultimatum and said aid needs to increase [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=612.42s)]
*  into Gaza. Where do we stand currently on that? Are they anywhere near meeting those [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=617.78s)]
*  goals? And you talk a lot about accountability. What if those goals are not met? What actually [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=622.62s)]
*  happens in the international system? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=627.1s)]
*  Well, you know, the Secretary General in his opening remark at the General Assembly was [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=629.06s)]
*  highlighting the impunity crisis the world is going through and this has been a very [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=634.86s)]
*  applied also to the situation in Gaza. We have seen over the last months that aid flow [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=642.34s)]
*  has significantly decreased while at the same time there have been an increase of military [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=652.86s)]
*  operations but also increase of humanitarian needs and this is the reason why we hear from [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=658.78s)]
*  our colleagues that hunger is spreading, that famine is again at the corner and that the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=664.1s)]
*  people in reality are also dying because of this disease and the hunger and I think it [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=672.34s)]
*  would be also, I mean, we should also be aware that there is certainly an excess of mortality [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=679.9s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip which so far has not yet been accounted for. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=688.78s)]
*  Are you, what's your reaction to, the global reaction to this? This is a war really unprecedented [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=694.78s)]
*  in many ways and a lot of the international media are not able to cover it but there's [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=702.06s)]
*  heroic journalism and eyewitness testimony happening from people on the ground, journalists [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=706.54s)]
*  on the ground, UN workers on the ground but what about international reaction? Where's [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=710.98s)]
*  the outrage? Are you shocked by the fact that for many this is perhaps being factored in [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=715.34s)]
*  as just another war? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=721.8199999999999s)]
*  I think we, what is shocking is that the unbearable is becoming a new norm and I think that the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=724.18s)]
*  unbearable is becoming more and more and becomes bearable. Yesterday at the France committee [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=732.18s)]
*  I was also saying that the difficulty today is that this conflict is so divisive, is so [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=736.46s)]
*  emotional that people are capable to feel compassion for one side but not for the other [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=744.74s)]
*  side which means people have difficulties to understand the suffering and the trauma [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=752.86s)]
*  October 7 has triggered in Israel and at the same time to feel the suffering, the devastation [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=760.86s)]
*  and the tragedy that the Palestinians are going through and I think as long as we are [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=770.14s)]
*  not capable to have this mutual empathy, mutual compassion we will still be far away from [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=776.62s)]
*  any reconciliation or any prospect of two people living in harmony or in peace. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=783.62s)]
*  What about the financing of Renora? It costs a lot of money to support people on the ground [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=795.46s)]
*  as we all know. The Americans have withheld financial aid for you, many countries around [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=800.98s)]
*  the world did after the brutal attacks of October 7th but that money has come back in. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=808.98s)]
*  That's not enough right? What are you projecting in terms of 2025 with the new US administration [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=813.82s)]
*  and are you also worried that there could be a knock on effect that other countries [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=819.78s)]
*  might decide to reverse their decision to fund? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=824.34s)]
*  To start with the cost is absolutely nothing compared to what's being invested in military [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=828.46s)]
*  capacity in this conflict. We are talking about one or two billion dollars, two billion [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=836.26s)]
*  dollars maybe in total to respond to humanitarian tragedy in Gaza when we keep hearing about [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=843.5400000000001s)]
*  the tens of billion dollars being invested for the continuation of this war. Now it is [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=850.5400000000001s)]
*  true that the appeal for Gaza is currently underfunded and that our agency is confronted [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=856.0600000000001s)]
*  to in the past to a chronic financial crisis but our financial situation has not improved. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=864.06s)]
*  As you rightly mentioned the US, the United States has frozen its contribution, it is [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=871.6999999999999s)]
*  and has been a long standing partner of the agency, the biggest donor. We still have today [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=878.6999999999999s)]
*  a short form, we are still struggling to cover all our costs between now and the end of the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=886.7s)]
*  year and it is true that the forecast for 2025 sounds quite bleak. The US will not start [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=894.7800000000001s)]
*  its contribution during the first quarter. Traditionally they paid their contribution [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=902.74s)]
*  at that time. A number of European countries are also entering into austerity budget so [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=908.86s)]
*  indeed 2025 might be financially also a challenging year. In fact the agency is going through [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=916.5s)]
*  an extraordinary existential crisis. I described it at the General Assembly as being one of [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=925.0600000000001s)]
*  the darkest hours the agency is going through. We have a double challenge, the political [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=932.54s)]
*  challenge with the desire to put an end to the agency and at the same time the financial [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=941.9799999999999s)]
*  challenge. Are there any ways to diversify funding? Are there any countries or regions [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=947.9399999999999s)]
*  that might be stepping up to try and fill that gap? Well we have seen in 2024 that a [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=952.56s)]
*  number of new donors came in and primarily from the global south but this is still far [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=959.06s)]
*  from compensating the loss we register from our main donor. Given all these crises and [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=966.98s)]
*  all these headwinds coming in your direction, is it even possible to project forward beyond [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=975.66s)]
*  this war after a ceasefire to the reconstruction of Gaza? You've seen it on the ground, your [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=981.06s)]
*  team sees it every day on the ground. It seems so daunting to try and not only rebuild materially [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=987.0600000000001s)]
*  Gaza but also do something about the trauma of the people. How do you project forward [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=993.58s)]
*  in that regard? Well it is daunting. I think it all will depend on the genuine desire and [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=998.1s)]
*  commitment of the international community to promote a political pathway, to promote [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1007.34s)]
*  peace, to promote a two-state solution. What we have seen before October 7 was increased [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1014.74s)]
*  disinterest of the international community, a de-prioritization of the Israel-Palestinian [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1024.14s)]
*  conflict and the region had the feeling that the international community was turning its [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1031.22s)]
*  back. So maybe the shockwave of October 7 is now telling us that we cannot have a lasting [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1038.22s)]
*  peace in the region without the Palestinian issue being properly addressed. And perhaps [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1051.58s)]
*  a possibility for more international media to be able to come in for it to resonate more [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1058.02s)]
*  in their home countries. We definitely need the presence of international media. We had [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1062.54s)]
*  heroic Palestinian journalists who have reported the situation in Gaza but unfortunately international [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1069.1s)]
*  media have been denied access and this is also fueling ultimately this war of narrative [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1077.5s)]
*  that we are witnessing and indeed one of the questions we should ask ourselves is what [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1085.5s)]
*  objective is Israel pursuing by denying the access of international journalists in Gaza? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1096.98s)]
*  Journalists are used to go in war zone. They have gone to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1105.34s)]
*  Why are they prevented to go to Gaza? And a critical tool in the fight against disinformation. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1111.26s)]
*  Exactly. Commissioner General, thank you so much for your time. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1116.7s)]
*  Thank you, Stephen. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GefmXojUQb8&t=1120.82s)]
