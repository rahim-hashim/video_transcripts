# (EN/HEB) Israel on the Middle East - Media Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc)
*  Good morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Israel's Ambassador to the UN, Danny Dunham, will deliver a brief statement ahead of this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  morning's General Assembly session. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  We are also joined by a special guest, Mia Shem, who the Ambassador will introduce. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=25.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=55.74s)]
*  I am honored to stand here today with Mia Shem. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=61.54s)]
*  For 50 days, Mia experienced what we cannot begin to comprehend. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  Mia saw her friends murdered at the Nova Music Festival, and she herself was taken hostage [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=72.16s)]
*  by Hamas terrorists. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=77.92s)]
*  She will soon share more about the atrocities she witnessed and experienced. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=80.36s)]
*  The United Nations is focused today on UNRWA, an organization that has spent decades fostering [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  the very violence and terrorism that tormented Mia and her friends. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=93.86s)]
*  We in Israel are focused on the hostages, the 101 innocent human beings still held captive, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=100.22s)]
*  tortured daily by Hamas. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=108.26s)]
*  The UN's complete moral failure is unforgivable. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=111.5s)]
*  It is unforgivable that while Mia was locked in a cage alongside other women, none of the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=115.56s)]
*  UN bodies, neither the Security Council nor the General Assembly, found the decency to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=122.72s)]
*  condemn Hamas and demand the hostages' release. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=130.02s)]
*  They have failed to meet this most basic moral obligation to this very day. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=134.98s)]
*  As the UN looks the other way, I make this promise to each and every hostage, to their [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  families and to the people of Israel. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  We will never forget you, never abandon you, and never stop until you are all safely back [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=153.42s)]
*  home. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=162.22s)]
*  Today, the UN will continue with its fixation on UNRWA, but we will always stay focused [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  on bringing our people home. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=171.26s)]
*  I would now like to ask Mia to say a few words in both English and Hebrew. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=174.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=181.22s)]
*  I am Mia Shem. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=194.22s)]
*  A year ago, I went out with my best friend to a sports event that turned into a time [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=195.22s)]
*  for alone hours, with hundreds of bodies of women and young men, victims, victims of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=200.22s)]
*  abuse and others who were kidnapped by the UN in Gaza. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=206.22s)]
*  I was in a state of zero control and wandered around in the streets when I almost fell off [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=211.22s)]
*  the body, covered in blood. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=217.22s)]
*  Around me, I heard the cries of men and women who were raped and murdered, when all [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=220.22s)]
*  of them laughed and laughed and turned their plans into mercy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=227.22s)]
*  Eliat Oledano, my good friend, was caught in front of me and I didn't know he would [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=232.22s)]
*  be killed and never see him again. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=239.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=242.22s)]
*  A short time after that, I was in a state of zero control in a car with seven Hamas [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=247.22s)]
*  gangs who kidnapped me in a farm in Gaza. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=252.22s)]
*  I was only 50 years old. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=257.22s)]
*  I was badly hurt, with pain in my hand, without treatment, without antibiotics and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=260.22s)]
*  without any other medicine. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=266.22s)]
*  Throughout the entire period, I was suffering from a loss of my body and soul. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=269.22s)]
*  A Hamas gang sat in a dark room with weapons aimed at my head. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=273.22s)]
*  No humanitarian cause came to see me, and my hand was in a state of despair. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=280.22s)]
*  On the 50th day, I was taken to the Gaienon mine, 60 meters underground. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=285.22s)]
*  There I was held in a small body with five other Israeli women. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=297.22s)]
*  Two Hamas gangs were afraid that I would sit in the dark, silent and silent. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=303.22s)]
*  We were in a state of panic, nervous, hurt and confused. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=309.22s)]
*  On the 55th day, I returned home and arrived at the hospital in Israel, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=315.22s)]
*  the last moment before my child was born, when she was already in a state of critical condition. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=320.22s)]
*  A year had passed since the terrible nature we had passed through, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=326.22s)]
*  and no one in the UN took a finger to remove my friends. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=330.22s)]
*  To remove sick, young men and one mother with two daughters. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=335.22s)]
*  I stand here to take care of the 101 victims and victims still in the Gaienon mines [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=341.22s)]
*  for 397 days. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=347.22s)]
*  Tabi to bi. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=350.22s)]
*  I am proof that they can be saved. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=352.22s)]
*  I call on you to save those who can be saved, and also to bring those who are in danger to the top of the world. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=355.22s)]
*  At this moment, 60 meters underground, in a dark room, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=361.22s)]
*  without air, my friends are buried. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=367.22s)]
*  My heart is with them, they were buried in Gaza. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=371.22s)]
*  I stand here, watching from my mother and begging you to bring everyone home now. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=375.22s)]
*  Be human, take care of our [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=381.22s)]
*  family, help us bring them home. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=385.16s)]
*  My name is Mia Shem. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=391.22s)]
*  One year and one month ago, I went with my best friend to a dance party. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=393.22s)]
*  It became a bloodbath. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=399.22s)]
*  Hundreds of young men and women were shot, dismembered, and others were brutally kidnapped to the tunnels of Hell in Gaza. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=402.22s)]
*  It was shot in point-blank range when my arm almost detached from my body, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=413.22s)]
*  hanging and bleeding. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=419.22s)]
*  All around me, I heard screams of people being raped and murdered, while their butchers left. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=423.22s)]
*  Eliyat Oledano, my best friend, was kidnapped before my eyes. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=432.22s)]
*  I did not know that we would be murdered and I would never see him again. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=441.22s)]
*  I was then dragged by my air into a car with seven Hamas monsters who kidnapped me while shouting with joy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=449.22s)]
*  For 50 days, I was kept alone, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=460.22s)]
*  suffering from unbearable pain in my hand without any treatment. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=465.22s)]
*  The Hamas terrorists would sit in front of me in a dark room with a gun pointed at my head. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=473.22s)]
*  Not a single humanitarian agency saw me or treated me, even as my arm got worse. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=481.22s)]
*  Where was the Red Cross? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=489.22s)]
*  Where was the UN demanding that we have access to us? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=492.22s)]
*  On day 50, I was lowered into the tunnels of Hell, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=498.22s)]
*  where I was kept in a small cage with five other Israeli women, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=504.22s)]
*  two armed terrorists made sure we sat in the dark in silence. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=511.22s)]
*  When I returned home, I needed life-saving surgery on my arm. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=517.22s)]
*  It's been over a year and the UN has not lifted a finger to free the hostages. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=522.22s)]
*  You sit here in your comfortable chairs, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=529.22s)]
*  demanding the lives of my friends as if they are political issues [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=534.22s)]
*  and not innocent people being tortured by terrorists. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=540.22s)]
*  I ask you, why do we have even a United Nations if you won't stand for us in the darkness of moments? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=545.22s)]
*  What grew are your resolutions, your debates, your empty promises? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=555.22s)]
*  If the sick, the elderly, mothers and their children are left to rot in terror tunnels, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=564.22s)]
*  I stand here to echo the cries of the 101 hostages who have no been in Hell for over a year. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=574.22s)]
*  Look at me. I am proof they can still be saved. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=584.22s)]
*  In this moment, 60 meters underground, with no air, no light, no hope, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=590.22s)]
*  my friends are still being held by monsters. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=598.22s)]
*  My art is still with them, captive in Gaza. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=603.22s)]
*  I stand here and demand that you bring them all home now. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=607.22s)]
*  Just be human. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=613.22s)]
*  Find some morality, find some courage and speak up. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=616.22s)]
*  Help us bring them home. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=621.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=625.22s)]
*  Question? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=633.22s)]
*  Ambassador, can we get your reaction to the U.S. election and what you think it means for the UN? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=637.22s)]
*  We first congratulate President Trump for his victory, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=643.22s)]
*  and we are looking forward to working with him, with the administration. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=647.22s)]
*  We have major tasks ahead of us. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=650.22s)]
*  The enemies of the United States are the enemies of Israel, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=652.22s)]
*  and I'm sure we will continue to work together. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=655.22s)]
*  You were here the first time around. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=658.22s)]
*  What are you expecting to see at the UN specifically? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=660.22s)]
*  Well, I think there are lots of things to change at the UN, to reform, to show the moral clarity, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=663.22s)]
*  and I hope that the new administration will lead to that direction. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=669.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ix3oN3RVkc&t=672.22s)]
