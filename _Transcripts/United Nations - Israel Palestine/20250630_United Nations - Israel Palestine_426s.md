# Israel on Gaza - Security Council Media Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc)
*  Good morning. As you all know, we still have 50 hostages in Gaza, and this war will not end when the hostages are still there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=0.0s)]
*  So hopefully we will have news about the negotiations, but I will stress to the Council today our commitment to bring them home, back, all of them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=12.0s)]
*  For weeks now, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been feeding the people of Gaza. Over 46 million meals have been delivered directly to Palestinian families. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=23.0s)]
*  Over 2 million meals are distributed in a single day, safely, efficiently, and without looting from Hamas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=34.0s)]
*  However, instead of supporting this effort, the UN has tried to sabotage it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=42.0s)]
*  It has ignored the GHF's offers for coordination. It has refused to condemn the brutal kidnapping and murder of GHF workers by Hamas. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=51.0s)]
*  Even it has threatened NGOs working with the GHF and assisting civilians in Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=63.0s)]
*  The UN is putting politics over humanitarian work. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=71.0s)]
*  Many in the UN are actively spreading disinformation promoted by Hamas-controlled sources, defaming the GHF's work and providing cover for further attacks. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=77.0s)]
*  This is a campaign, an organized, orchestrated campaign, of defamation has now reached the point of absurdity. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=89.0s)]
*  Some actors have even promoted the insane conspiracy that GHF aid contains drugs. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=99.0s)]
*  That's what they are trying to do. The UN should stop standing in the way. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=110.0s)]
*  I urge the Secretary General and all UN officials, if you care about the people of Gaza, stop with this campaign of defamation and the obstruction. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=117.0s)]
*  And help them, help the people of Gaza. Thank you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=128.0s)]
*  First, the follow-up. You mentioned about the Gaza humanitarian fund and the disinformation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=134.0s)]
*  Is the killing of civilians by IDF disinformation? And isn't the whole Gaza humanitarian fund a political campaign? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=143.0s)]
*  Secondly, your finance minister Smok Cic said, and I quote, this war must end only in victory. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=154.0s)]
*  No agreements, no partners, no mediators, only a decisive blow. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=162.0s)]
*  The destruction of Hamas and the return of hostages from the position of power. Is that the official position of the Israeli government? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=167.0s)]
*  First regarding the GHF, so yes, there is a campaign spreading lies. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=175.0s)]
*  And whenever we get those reports, we check them. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=180.0s)]
*  And that's what Hamas is trying to do, preventing people from getting to those places. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=184.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, the UN is doing the same. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=189.0s)]
*  And I would expect the UN to look at the facts. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=192.0s)]
*  So when we get reports, we check them. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=196.0s)]
*  And we make sure that those areas will be safe for civilians to come. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=199.0s)]
*  There are other forces who are trying to do the opposite. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=205.0s)]
*  Regarding your question about the government, whenever we had an agreement on the table, we accepted it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=208.0s)]
*  The government of Israel accepted already few ceasefire agreements. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=216.0s)]
*  And now there are negotiations. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=221.0s)]
*  And I believe that if it will come to the point of a vote in the government, there will be a majority to accept a ceasefire. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=223.0s)]
*  So yes, you have different voices. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=232.0s)]
*  We are a democracy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=234.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, the government votes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=235.0s)]
*  And so far, whenever the prime minister brought a proposal for a ceasefire to the government, he got the majority and it was approved. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=238.0s)]
*  So are there deaths close to the Gaza humanitarian fund position? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=246.0s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=253.0s)]
*  Are there civilian deaths there? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=254.0s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, there were a few incidents. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=257.0s)]
*  But I can tell you one thing for sure. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=261.0s)]
*  The numbers that were reported by Hamas were not correct. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=263.0s)]
*  They were lies. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=268.0s)]
*  They tried to create the impression that it's not safe and people should not go there. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=270.0s)]
*  Instead of actually showing the real facts, please. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=275.0s)]
*  Ambassador Celia Davaren, Africa Confidential. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=278.0s)]
*  Is that true what we read in the newspaper that your government gave order to kill the people from Gaza who were trying to get food? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=282.0s)]
*  Is that true or not true? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=292.0s)]
*  Absolutely not true. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=294.0s)]
*  On the contrary, we're taking efforts in order to guarantee the security of the parameter and push Hamas away from those areas. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=295.0s)]
*  Hamas is trying to make those areas not safe for people to come in. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=304.0s)]
*  Our interest is that this initiative will work. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=308.0s)]
*  Hamas' interest is exactly the opposite. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=311.0s)]
*  They want people not to cooperate. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=314.0s)]
*  They want people not to come to those centers. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=316.0s)]
*  We have exactly the different approach. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=318.0s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=321.0s)]
*  In Kufr Malik, settlers killed three civilians the other day. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=323.0s)]
*  And on Monday, they killed in the same village a 13-year-old boy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=329.0s)]
*  Did Israel ever put a settler on trial and sentence him to what he deserved to be sentenced for? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=334.0s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=343.0s)]
*  Israel sentenced people who breached the law. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=344.0s)]
*  So you had the incident in the village of Dora that you have people who committed a horrible crime, and now they're in jail for many, many years. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=348.0s)]
*  I gave you an answer. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=364.0s)]
*  But today I will speak in the council about the terror attacks in Judea and Samaria where a family drove to the hospital when the baby was about to come to life. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=366.0s)]
*  And the mother was killed with the baby. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=377.0s)]
*  And it happened only a few weeks ago. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=379.0s)]
*  So we hope that we will be able to fight those terrorists and not only them, but also those who are sending the money for them to purchase those weapons. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=381.0s)]
*  And I'm talking about Iran. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=391.0s)]
*  One last question, please. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=393.0s)]
*  General, the media and the press service, why would Israeli soldiers lie about being ordered to shoot civilians going into fighting? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=394.0s)]
*  They are not lying. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=400.0s)]
*  On the contrary, our soldiers work according to international law. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=401.0s)]
*  We're doing everything we can to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=406.0s)]
*  Hamas is doing exactly the opposite. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=409.0s)]
*  They want to see more civilians dead. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=411.0s)]
*  We have exactly the opposite goal. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=414.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1E46g8TTxc&t=416.0s)]
