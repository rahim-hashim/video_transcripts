# Israel on Gaza | Security Council Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8)
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to start by expressing my gratitude to the delegation of the U.S., the U.K., and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=8.28s)]
*  France for calling this long overdue session of the Security Council. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=14.24s)]
*  What is happening now here in this building is unprecedented. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=19.78s)]
*  We hear many voices demanding that we halt our efforts, lay down our weapons, some even [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=23.34s)]
*  question why we continue to fight Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=29.98s)]
*  You're going to hear it in a few minutes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=34.02s)]
*  The disconnect between the horrific reality of October 7th, the massacre, the abductions, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=37.3s)]
*  and the current situation in Gaza is difficult to comprehend. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=43.9s)]
*  Many seem to have forgotten why we started this war, why we are fighting now in Gaza. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=48.46s)]
*  But we have not. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  We remember the faces, we remember the families, and we will not forget them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=56.26s)]
*  The disconnection allows some to behave as if October 7th never happened, as though there [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=64.78s)]
*  are no hostages in Gaza now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=70.14s)]
*  Babies, young girls suffering in the hands of Hamas. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=72.82s)]
*  Today I will remind the Council and the world that we will never forget them. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=77.62s)]
*  We will never abandon our sons, daughters, sisters, and brothers who are being tortured [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=82.98s)]
*  by monsters. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=89.86s)]
*  Since October 7th, the Security Council has passed four resolutions with no condemnation [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=90.86s)]
*  of Hamas for their crimes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the General Assembly has passed two resolutions. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=99.26s)]
*  Hamas is never even mentioned in either resolution. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=103.62s)]
*  They vaguely mention the release of those held captive, but fail to identify the Hamas [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=108.34s)]
*  monsters who took them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=116.5s)]
*  Today I will demand that the Security Council adopt a clear and unequivocal resolution. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=119.42s)]
*  This should not require negotiations or deliberations. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=125.97999999999999s)]
*  The Council has a moral obligation to adopt a very simple resolution that condemns Hamas, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=129.74s)]
*  their atrocities, designates them as a terrorist organization, and demands the release of the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=136.78s)]
*  hostages. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=142.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=144.58s)]
*  Thank you, Ambassador. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=149.74s)]
*  I'm Sheree Fitcherton from UNHCR. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=150.74s)]
*  I would just like to ask you about the latest situation on the hostage deal and ceasefire [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=152.46s)]
*  talks. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=156.34s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu has been criticized by many, including President Biden, for not [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=157.34s)]
*  doing enough, and the protesters in Israel, some of them, are also blaming the Prime Minister [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=163.02s)]
*  for not wanting to reach a deal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=168.18s)]
*  Are you disappointed by this criticism, or do you not take it into consideration at all? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=170.18s)]
*  And could you elaborate on the latest situation on the talks? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=174.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=178.26s)]
*  First, I'm proud to be in a strong democracy that one is allowed to demonstrate and to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=179.26s)]
*  criticize the government. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=183.5s)]
*  We haven't seen any demonstrations in Gaza since October 7th, and I'm sure you have a [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=184.5s)]
*  lot of people who are not happy with what's happening there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=189.38s)]
*  But let's speak about the facts regarding the ceasefire proposals. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=192.46s)]
*  On May, the U.S. presented a draft agreement. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=196.66s)]
*  We said yes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=202.18s)]
*  Hamas said no. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=203.18s)]
*  In August, it happened again. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=204.18s)]
*  The U.S. put another draft. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=206.26s)]
*  We said yes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  Hamas said no. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  So I think the blame is on Hamas, not on the Prime Minister and not on the Israeli government. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  Ambassador, Shiedotra with China Central Television. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  I have two questions, but first, sorry for the loss of six lives. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=219.26s)]
*  But how would this tragic event impact? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=222.82s)]
*  Will you still have this negotiation going on? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=225.66s)]
*  And will there be any terms changes? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=228.22s)]
*  So we will continue in our efforts to bring the boys and girls back home. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=232.01999999999998s)]
*  Today, I will reveal in the Council some of the testimonials of the hostages who were [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=236.22s)]
*  able to get out of the tunnels of Hamas. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=240.42s)]
*  We will pray and we will fight to bring them back. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=244.92s)]
*  So we will continue both the military action to find them, but also we will continue with [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=247.14000000000001s)]
*  negotiations because we are determined to bring them back home. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  Ambassador, here's the thing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=255.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean, Prime Minister Netanyahu has said many times that the target for the military [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=258.86s)]
*  operation in Gaza is to eliminate the capacity of Hamas. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  While you're still having the negotiation with Hamas, can you elaborate a little bit [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=266.7s)]
*  why Hamas would engage in a negotiation that even they had a deal, they were still doomed [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=271.74s)]
*  to be eliminated? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=277.5s)]
*  No, for the future of Gaza and the future of Israel, Hamas will not be in presence in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=279.7s)]
*  the near future. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=285.98s)]
*  We are moving. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=287.18s)]
*  We are achieving our goals. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=288.36s)]
*  But at the same time, we cannot leave behind the hostages. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=290.06s)]
*  It's part of the Jewish value to pray and to do whatever we can to release the hostages. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=294.42s)]
*  That's why we are actually not negotiating directly with them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=300.28s)]
*  We do it with the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt, but we know that we are sending messages to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=303.64s)]
*  Hamas because we see the faces of the hostages in front of our eyes every day. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=308.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=316.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=317.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=318.24s)]
*  Today I will present to the Security Council our request to defend Hamas and to declare [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=319.24s)]
*  the release of the hostages immediately. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=326.24s)]
*  It is not certain that the UN General Assembly and the Security Council will discuss only [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=329.24s)]
*  issues related to the Palestinian crisis in Gaza and will not discuss what is happening [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=334.24s)]
*  to our hostages. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=339.24s)]
*  I thank the United States, France and Britain for holding this important discussion today, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=340.24s)]
*  but it is not enough. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=345.24s)]
*  We are making a decision that defends Hamas and denies the release of the hostages. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=347.24s)]
*  We will not sit quietly until we return everyone home. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=353.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=356.24s)]
*  You want to give me the... [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMCm974pVC8&t=376.24s)]
