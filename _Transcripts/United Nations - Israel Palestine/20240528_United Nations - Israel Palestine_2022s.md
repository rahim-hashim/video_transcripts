Video Description: The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)’s Director of Communication said, “According to our teams on the ground, the heavy bombardment continued overnight in the area including Tel al-Sultan, that is north of Rafah where the UN main offices including the UNRWA offices are in Gaza." She added that “people are absolutely terrified.”

________________________

The Agency’s senior official Juliette Touma spoke to reporters from Amman today (28 May) via a video link.

She said, “The teams today said that the aftermath of the harrowing attack on Sunday is huge. According to some international medical sources that our teams spoke to, at least 200 people were killed in that attack amongst them women and children. The attack added to the general fear of death, people are seeing so much death around them.”

On humanitarian supplies, Touma updated reporters that “just over 200 trucks with humanitarian supplies have been picked up in the last three weeks. This is of course a drop in the ocean amid people's humanitarian needs, as they continue to immensely grow.”

She continued, “This very, very small number of trucks that has been picked up is due to several factors. One is the heavy movement restrictions that the Israeli authorities continue to impose on the humanitarian community; the ongoing Israeli forces airstrikes; recent expansion of the military operation in the area; the recent launch of rockets by Hamas delays and limitations in general on the routes that can be used by the humanitarian teams including UNRWA and the fuel coming in by far is not enough to support of humanitarian operations in Gaza.”

The Director of Communications also said, “We're also running out of medical supplies and basic medicines due to shortages of humanitarian deliveries.”

“On the general situation, our teams reported that there's very little to no electricity in Rafah and very patchy internet conditions, the telecommunication’ network continues to be interrupted,” she added.

In closing of her statement, Touma reiterated the call of the UN Secretary General for “an immediate ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages to end the suffering of civilians.”

She added, “We also echo the SG’s dismay on the lack of the implementation of the recent order of the International Court of Justice regarding Rafah. These decisions are binding, military operation in Rafah must immediately end and the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza must improve without further delay.”

Asked about funding, Touma said, “Most of the donors who have suspended the funding to UNRWA back in January and have now returned, apart from countries that is the United States and the United Kingdom. And the funding that comes to UNRWA also includes funding to our operations in Gaza. We are not at all out of the woods of course and it is very, very hard for us to know what will happen beyond the end of June with regards to operations across the region of the agency including those in Gaza.”

Asked about Israeli Knesset to vote on a bill to designate the Agency as a terror organization, the UNRWA’s Director of Communications said, “this is the last straw, the last attempt in a number of attempts over the past month to dismantle UNRWA.”

She reiterated, “UNRWA is the backbone of the humanitarian operation in Gaza, and it provides human development services to Palestine Refugees around the region, including over half a million boys and girls that go to UNRWA schools.”

*  On that note, Juliette, if we could put our guest on the screen, we're delighted to be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=0.0s)]
*  joined by our friend Juliette Thuma, who is briefing us from Amman. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=10.0s)]
*  Juliette, please, I don't know if you want to say a few words and then we'll take some [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=16.0s)]
*  questions. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=20.0s)]
*  Hi, can you hear me? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=21.0s)]
*  Yes, we can. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=24.0s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=25.0s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=26.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me and good to see everyone. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=27.0s)]
*  Yes, I'll say just a few words, operational update on what's happening in Gaza and what [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=30.0s)]
*  we've been getting from our colleagues there and then, yes, for sure we'll take some questions. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=36.0s)]
*  An update on the displacement over the past three weeks, so since the 6th of May, according [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=41.0s)]
*  to ANRA, more than a million people have fled Rafah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=49.0s)]
*  The displacement continues today. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=54.0s)]
*  This caseload of people that has been recently displaced, it's been displaced several times [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=57.0s)]
*  already. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=66.0s)]
*  According to our teams on the ground, heavy bombardment continued overnight in the area, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=67.0s)]
*  including in Tala Sultan, that's north of Rafah, where the UN main offices, including [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=73.0s)]
*  the ANRA offices, are in Gaza. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=79.0s)]
*  This is the center of operations. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=82.0s)]
*  Most of our staff could not make it to work today. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=85.0s)]
*  They were packing and moving. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=89.0s)]
*  People are absolutely terrified. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=92.0s)]
*  A lot of people are fleeing to Almawasi and they're also fleeing to the middle areas, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=93.0s)]
*  including to Deir el-Balach. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=99.0s)]
*  These are already, as you may know, crammed and crowded areas. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=103.0s)]
*  On the humanitarian supplies, an update on the overall number of trucks. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=107.0s)]
*  Just over 200 trucks with humanitarian supplies have been picked up in the last three weeks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=113.0s)]
*  This is, of course, a drop in the ocean amid people's humanitarian needs as they continue [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=121.0s)]
*  to immensely grow. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=127.0s)]
*  This very, very small number of trucks that has been picked up is due to several factors. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=131.0s)]
*  One is the heavy movement restrictions that the Israeli authorities continue to impose [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=139.0s)]
*  on the humanitarian community, the ongoing Israeli forces' airstrikes and the recent [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=145.0s)]
*  expansion of the military operation in the area, and the recent launch of rockets by [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=151.0s)]
*  Hamas, delays and limitations in general on the routes that can be used by the humanitarian [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=157.0s)]
*  teams, including UNRWA, and that the fuel coming in is by far not enough to support [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=163.0s)]
*  the humanitarian operation in Gaza. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=169.0s)]
*  We are also running out of UNRWA medical supplies and basic medicines due to the shortages [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=172.0s)]
*  of humanitarian deliveries. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=178.0s)]
*  On the general situation, our teams reported that there is very little to no electricity [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=181.0s)]
*  in Rafah and very patchy internet connection. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=187.0s)]
*  The telecommunications network continues to be interrupted. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=191.0s)]
*  The UNRWA commissioner general has just issued a statement on his official ex-account, previously [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=196.0s)]
*  known as Twitter, where he described the situation in Gaza as, quote, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=203.0s)]
*  End of quote. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=208.0s)]
*  He added, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=213.0s)]
*  End of quote. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=217.0s)]
*  The teams today said that the aftermath of the harrowing attack on Sunday is huge. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=221.0s)]
*  According to some international medical sources that our teams spoke to, at least 200 people [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=229.0s)]
*  were killed in that attack, among them women and children. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=236.0s)]
*  The attack added to the general fear of death. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=240.0s)]
*  People are seeing so much death around them. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=244.0s)]
*  A colleague who recently returned from Gaza told me today, people are dying inside. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=247.0s)]
*  Everywhere they look, there is death, and it is as if people have accepted that death is their fate. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=254.0s)]
*  One colleague who has moved this morning from Rafah to Almawasi after debating for weeks asked me, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=262.0s)]
*  what's the point of moving yet again if I'm going to be killed anyway? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=269.0s)]
*  It is a chance here to pay tribute to all our UNRWA team members who have been killed since the war began. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=274.0s)]
*  There are 192 of them to date. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=281.0s)]
*  One colleague killed is one colleague too many, and the agency UNRWA will never be the same without them. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=284.0s)]
*  In closing, UNRWA reiterates the call of the UN Secretary General for an immediate ceasefire [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=291.0s)]
*  and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages to end the suffering of civilians. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=297.0s)]
*  We also echo the SG's dismay by the lack of the implementation of the recent order of the International Court of Justice regarding Rafah. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=303.0s)]
*  These decisions are binding. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=312.0s)]
*  The military operation in Rafah must immediately end, and the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza must improve without further delay. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=314.0s)]
*  Staff, thank you, and I'm happy to take questions. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=324.0s)]
*  Thank you. We'll start with Edie. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=327.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, Juliet, on behalf of the United Nations Correspondence Association. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=330.0s)]
*  Thank you for doing this briefing. My name is Edith Lederath from the Associated Press. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=337.0s)]
*  First, could you give us some more details on where you just said that at least 200 people had been killed in the Israeli airstrike in Gaza yesterday. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=344.0s)]
*  And could you also tell us what UNRWA's expectations are for this legislation that's being debated in Israel tomorrow, I believe. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=366.0s)]
*  Great. Thanks, Edith, and good to see you and hear you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=386.0s)]
*  Thank you. Look, the 200 people killed that came from the International Aid Organization Medical Aid for the Palestinian Map UK that came from them this afternoon. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=389.0s)]
*  On the bill, exactly what Steph said, I would also say that our Commissioner General has described this bill as outrageous. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=402.0s)]
*  All right, Nabil. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=416.0s)]
*  Hi, Juliet. This is Nabil Abisab, an Arabi TV station correspondent. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=422.0s)]
*  Two questions. It seems that there are a lot of funding coming from maybe European countries or other countries that target only certain projects or maybe limited to certain areas or I don't know what kind of services they target. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=428.0s)]
*  But have you received this kind of funding that does not or do not include Gaza? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=453.0s)]
*  Or do you feel that Gaza is now excluded from many funding coming from certain governments? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=464.0s)]
*  No, we have not, Nabil. Nice to see you. Look, most of the donors who have suspended the funding to UNRWA back in January have now returned apart from two countries, that is the United States and the United Kingdom, I beg your pardon. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=475.0s)]
*  And the funding that comes to UNRWA also includes funding to our operations in Gaza. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=492.0s)]
*  We are not at all out of the woods, of course, and it is very, very hard for us to know what will happen beyond the end of June with regards to the operations across the region of the agency, including those in Gaza. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=499.0s)]
*  And my second question is about Ain al-Hilwi camp in Lebanon. What's the situation there? Are you able to provide services as usual or the way you used to do in Ain al-Hilwi? Because there was a problem with a political committee, I think, in the camp between UNRWA and some parties in the camp. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=515.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Nabil. I have just returned from Beirut last night where I was accompanying the UNRWA commissioner general on a trip there. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=542.0s)]
*  We have had some disruption in the service delivery of the UNRWA services in the camp. We have also had a sit-in outside our compound in Beirut where members of the Palestinian factions have closed our offices in Beirut for the past six weeks. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=555.0s)]
*  Fortunately, the office has now reopened and the services have largely resumed. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=576.0s)]
*  Thanks, Juliet. Michelle Nichols from Reuters. Sorry, just to clarify again, you said that MAPS has said nearly 200 or around 200 were killed in the Israeli strikes in Rafah on Sunday. That's right? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=584.0s)]
*  Yes, this is according to medical aid for Palestinians, yes. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=601.0s)]
*  Okay, great, thank you. What can you tell us about the incident today that appears to have killed more than 20 people? What does UNRWA know about that? And then what's left to distribute at the moment in terms of aid given there's so little getting in? Thank you. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=604.0s)]
*  Which incident, Michelle, today? Which one are you referring to? I think it was in... [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=627.0s)]
*  I think a couple. Yeah, Al Mawasi. There was about 21 I think was the last test though. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=631.0s)]
*  Yes, we've only seen reports on Al Mawasi that we haven't been able to confirm. But to say that these reports are testament to the fact that no place is safe in Gaza, that no one is safe in Gaza, that no one is spared in Gaza, that there's certainly no so-called, quote-unquote, humanitarian or safe zone in Gaza. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=638.0s)]
*  If we get more information on Al Mawasi, Michelle, we will send an update. And the second question is on what's left to distribute? Not much. I mean, we've run out of food very early on when the military operation started. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=662.0s)]
*  We're getting very, very, very little humanitarian supplies into Gaza. And I think in the briefing I covered why we're not able to pick up those humanitarian supplies. And we're running out of medicines in UNRWA clinics and pharmacies. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=682.0s)]
*  And in just over three weeks to the south of Gaza, and I think it's important to say just to the south of Gaza, the UN has been able to pick up just over 200 trucks, which is not at all enough because normally what Gaza needs is 500 trucks and it should be a combination of commercial supplies and humanitarian supplies. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=702.0s)]
*  So what we've got right now is in just over three weeks is 200, just over 200. We have this dashboard that we track the data on the trucks that you're welcome to consult. It's on the UNRWA website. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=727.0s)]
*  And sorry, just one last quick follow-up. Egypt said they didn't want to reopen Ra'far because it was too dangerous for humanitarians on the Gaza side. Does UNRWA agree with that? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=742.0s)]
*  Look, what I do know is that the Ra'far crossing has not opened yet. And those very, very little amounts of humanitarian supplies are only coming via the Kerem Abu Salim or Kerem Shalom crossing that connects Israel with southern Gaza. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=755.0s)]
*  Zhu Deshi? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=772.0s)]
*  Hi, Julia. This is Dezhu Xu with China Central Television. Just now you said the Commissioner General of UNRWA, when he described the Knesset move, he said it's outrageous. Can you elaborate why UNRWA thinks that's outrageous? In what way that would impact the operation of UNRWA? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=775.0s)]
*  And second, you just mentioned in about three weeks, there are just over 200 trucks get into Gaza. UNRWA has already suspended its operation in Ra'far area. Do you feel like there might be more suspensions for UNRWA on its humanitarian operations? Thank you. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=797.0s)]
*  Okay, thanks. I'm good to see you again. Look, we have not suspended our operations. Just to be accurate, we have suspended the food distribution in southern Gaza because we simply ran out of stuff to give out to people, food stuff, right? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=823.0s)]
*  But we have continued our operations. Our operations are ongoing. We continue to provide primary health care as one example to the communities in need. We have opened mobile clinics in places like Almawasi also to respond to the needs of the population in that area. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=838.0s)]
*  So we have not suspended our operations. What we are saying, however, is that the humanitarian space is shrinking by the hour, by the day, because of all these restrictions that are imposed on the humanitarian community. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=858.0s)]
*  On the Commissioner General describing the decision outrageous is because this is the last straw in a series of accusations, allegations, outrageous in that sense against the agency, which is the beating heart and the backbone of the humanitarian operation in Gaza, which is an agency that has been for more than seven decades providing human-deaf-care. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=872.0s)]
*  And we have also extended our development services to one of the most deprived communities in the world right now, the Palestine refugees. So this is why he called it outrageous. And I can send you also the transcript from the briefing, the press briefing that he did in Beirut yesterday. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=902.0s)]
*  There's also a video I can send to the colleagues in the spokesperson's office if you'd like to know more. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=919.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=925.0s)]
*  Thank you, Juliet. This is Abdulhamid Asiam of the Arabic daily Al-Quds Al-Arabi. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=926.0s)]
*  First, if you can tell us more about the situation in Jabalia refugee camps. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=933.0s)]
*  Do you have people there trying to distribute anything? And if you can give us more details about the latest development in Jabalia refugee camp. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=939.0s)]
*  Okay, thanks, Abdulhamid. And good to see you as I've already looked at the latest that we have on Jabalia is that since the 6th of May when there was also further expansion of the Israeli military operation in the area is that there's give or take 100,000 people who are forced to be displaced in in in in Jabalia. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=951.0s)]
*  And Andrea has teams everywhere across the Gaza Strip, including in in Jabalia camp. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=974.0s)]
*  But obviously, with the recent expansion of the military operation, the the restrictions and ability for our staff to deliver humanitarian assistance in the area is a is very, very limited. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=979.0s)]
*  And we also have very little supplies that humanitarian supplies that come into northern Gaza. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=997.0s)]
*  You see, the Israeli authorities have banned Andra in March from sending humanitarian convoys to to to northern Gaza. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1004.0s)]
*  And the last time that Andra was able itself to deliver humanitarian convoy with food to Gaza was on the 29th of January. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1014.0s)]
*  That was four months ago. Thank you. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1023.0s)]
*  Regarding the countries that resumed funding for honor, you said just only two did not resume the UK and the US. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1026.0s)]
*  How how did you manage with the is there a big deficit now in the budget? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1035.0s)]
*  Can you sustain yourself to the end of the year or still large shortages in the budget? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1043.0s)]
*  We're only able so far to operate until the end of June. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1050.0s)]
*  It is very, very difficult for us to have any forecast on what's going to happen beyond the end of June. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1059.0s)]
*  Taking into account that 14 countries resume funding, that means they didn't believe in the allegations. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1067.0s)]
*  So the allegations Israel launched against honor had been proven untrue. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1076.0s)]
*  Yet Israel is going too far to declare honor. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1084.0s)]
*  What is a terrorist organization? Can you talk about this paradox? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1088.0s)]
*  What is the question of the question as many as the word is believing that honor is innocent of all these allegations. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1093.0s)]
*  Yet Israel is going too far to accuse honor of being a terrorist organization. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1100.0s)]
*  Can you address this? I think you need to ask the member states on the donors why they have resumed their funding to honor. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1106.0s)]
*  That's the question that you need to ask the donor countries. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1114.0s)]
*  I also take a chance to say that there were several countries who have come forward who have not been donors to the agency before. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1117.0s)]
*  That also includes countries from the region like most recently Iraq and Algeria. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1127.0s)]
*  And we've also seen huge global solidarity from individuals from around the world that came forward in support of AMRA. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1133.0s)]
*  So only since the war began we have received over $120 million from private donors and individuals. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1142.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1154.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1158.0s)]
*  Kristen from Al Jazeera English. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1159.0s)]
*  You mentioned an UNRWA facility was struck over the weekend. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1161.0s)]
*  Can you give more details on that? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1165.0s)]
*  And given what's happening in the Knesset, do you feel like UNRWA is being directly targeted by Israel? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1167.0s)]
*  Can you tell us what was in that facility? Was it being used? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1175.0s)]
*  And how many facilities have been hit in the last week maybe or month? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1179.0s)]
*  Yes, thanks so much. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1185.0s)]
*  I'm not sure I said that another facility was hit on the weekend. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1188.0s)]
*  I think what I referred to is the attack that happened on Sunday that was quite close to an UNRWA facility. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1192.0s)]
*  And that is the logistics base that UNRWA has in the area. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1200.0s)]
*  So the facility was not hit on Sunday. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1207.0s)]
*  But just to answer your question on the number of facilities that have been hit since the beginning of the war, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1211.0s)]
*  it's over 160 facilities of UNRWA that have been hit since the war began. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1218.0s)]
*  Some were directly hit. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1225.0s)]
*  Some were hit more than once. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1226.0s)]
*  And overall, there have been over 450 people who were killed. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1228.0s)]
*  They were sheltering in UNRWA facilities when these hits have taken place. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1239.0s)]
*  On the Knesset bill, like I said, this is the last show, the last attempt in a number of attempts. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1244.0s)]
*  Over the past months, UNRWA is the backbone of the humanitarian operation in Gaza. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1257.0s)]
*  And it provides human development services to Palestinian refugees around the region, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1267.0s)]
*  including over half a million boys and girls that go to UNRWA schools. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1274.0s)]
*  Okay. Margaret Breshear. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1281.0s)]
*  Hi, Juliet. It's Margaret Breshear with VOA. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1285.0s)]
*  Again, on this Knesset bill, if it is adopted, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1289.0s)]
*  would that essentially mean that UNRWA is shut down in the territories and East Jerusalem, West Bank, all of it? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1293.0s)]
*  Yeah. Thanks for your question. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1302.0s)]
*  Look, I'm not a legal expert. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1304.0s)]
*  There are several other colleagues who are looking into the what if. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1306.0s)]
*  At the moment, we are not speculating. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1312.0s)]
*  Okay. Linda Fasula. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1315.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1317.0s)]
*  I have a question regarding the distribution of food. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1319.0s)]
*  What portion of the Palestinians in Gaza, the civilians, what portion is given food, provided food by UNRWA, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1323.0s)]
*  versus I've been reading the various commercial trucks have been entering Gaza or have entered Gaza, and food is being bought. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1333.0s)]
*  So I was just wondering what portion of people are buying versus being given. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1341.0s)]
*  Okay. So a lot of people depend on UNRWA and other humanitarian organizations for their food intake. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1346.0s)]
*  This is true because the private sector has very early on shut down. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1357.0s)]
*  So the shops, the stores in Gaza have shut down early on because they couldn't replenish the supplies. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1364.0s)]
*  So the entire population of two million people was forced to rely almost entirely on food handouts [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1370.0s)]
*  and other humanitarian assistance coming largely from UNRWA as the largest humanitarian organization working inside Gaza. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1380.0s)]
*  On the commercial trucks, I don't have much information. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1390.0s)]
*  I do know that there's been, according to reports that we're not able to verify, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1394.0s)]
*  that there's been commercial trucks indeed crossing into Gaza. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1399.0s)]
*  The question is when these commercial trucks bring in food supplies, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1405.0s)]
*  how will people afford those food supplies that are coming to the market? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1410.0s)]
*  Because most people in Gaza don't have enough cash. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1416.0s)]
*  There is a cash flow problem or they simply cannot afford it because we understand that the prices of these commodities [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1420.0s)]
*  are quite high and unaffordable for the vast majority of the community in Gaza. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1428.0s)]
*  This is precisely why there needs to be more humanitarian supplies coming into Gaza on a regular basis. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1434.0s)]
*  Yes, in the back. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1441.0s)]
*  Thank you. This is Anas with Sky News Arabia. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1442.0s)]
*  I was wondering, apparently the U.S. military suspending the mission of delivering aid through the pier across from Gaza's coast. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1444.0s)]
*  Since we got to this point, do you have any assessment of how efficient was this idea [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1455.0s)]
*  and how many trucks, tons of human aid have been delivered to Palestinians in Gaza? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1462.0s)]
*  How do you assess the whole process since beginning till the suspension? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1471.0s)]
*  Thanks, Anas. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1475.0s)]
*  UNRWA is not at all involved on the pier side. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1478.0s)]
*  We do not have any information on what came through on the pier. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1481.0s)]
*  What we've been saying is that any way that brings any message, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1485.0s)]
*  any way that brings in more humanitarian supplies into Gaza is very welcome. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1490.0s)]
*  However, the cheapest, most efficient, most secure, fastest way to bring in humanitarian supplies into Gaza [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1495.0s)]
*  is via road and via the crossings that connect Israel with the Gaza Strip. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1504.0s)]
*  Has the UNRWA received any humanitarian aid from that pier, like through that pier? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1510.0s)]
*  We have not been involved in the pier. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1517.0s)]
*  Just to add, it was the World Food Program that was the entity in charge of logistics [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1520.0s)]
*  once we received aid from the floating dock. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1530.0s)]
*  And they said that they've received something on the order of 96 trucks worth during the time that the floating dock was functioning. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1533.0s)]
*  Also, are you in touch with Biden administration in terms of funding the UNRWA, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1541.0s)]
*  given that your office here in the U.S., especially in Washington, D.C., [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1546.0s)]
*  receiving a lot of donations from American citizens who are willing to give through UNRWA to the Palestinian people, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1551.0s)]
*  are you in touch with them in terms of resuming the funding through the U.S.? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1557.0s)]
*  And if you have any update on that? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1565.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. We are in touch with all our partners. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1568.0s)]
*  And the U.S. government is a partner to UNRWA. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1574.0s)]
*  I think we should just, just to be accurate, there are two separate things. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1577.0s)]
*  There is an NGO in Washington, D.C., that is called UNRWA USA, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1582.0s)]
*  that primarily does fundraising through the private sector or the private individuals. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1589.0s)]
*  So what I mentioned in answer to one of the questions on the funding, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1594.0s)]
*  the 120 million dollars that came from individuals, some of it also came through the UNRWA USA work. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1599.0s)]
*  And one last thing. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1608.0s)]
*  That make sense? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1610.0s)]
*  Yes. One last question. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1611.0s)]
*  If you have any update on the number of UN facilities, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1612.0s)]
*  especially UNRWA facilities that have been targeted in Gaza and the number of your employees, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1616.0s)]
*  like an update number for both? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1622.0s)]
*  Sure. I think I just gave an update to the friend from Al Jazeera. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1624.0s)]
*  160 facilities since the beginning of the war. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1629.0s)]
*  160 UNRWA facilities have been hit. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1633.0s)]
*  Some of them have been hit more than once. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1636.0s)]
*  Some of them have been directly hit, some indirectly hit. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1639.0s)]
*  And there's been overall more than 450 people who were killed [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1642.0s)]
*  while they were taking shelter in UNRWA facilities. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1649.0s)]
*  Okay. Iri? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1653.0s)]
*  Hi, Julia. Two follow-ups. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1656.0s)]
*  First, can you give us an update on the extent of famine in Gaza? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1658.0s)]
*  And secondly, is there any indication of when fuel is going to run out? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1667.0s)]
*  Yeah, Idit, thanks. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1676.0s)]
*  On the famine, perhaps it's better to wait for the report that's going to come out from the IPC, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1677.0s)]
*  which is the World Experts on Food Security and Nutrition. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1683.0s)]
*  It's due to come out end of the month, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1687.0s)]
*  and perhaps better to be in touch through Farhan with colleagues in WFP and FAO and others. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1689.0s)]
*  What we are very, very worried about, Idit, is the situation in the South [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1697.0s)]
*  and whether we are going to see a repeat of what we saw in the North, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1702.0s)]
*  including Gaza City, when it comes to levels of hunger and starvation. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1708.0s)]
*  That is very, very much related to what I mentioned on the little humanitarian supplies, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1712.0s)]
*  including food available in southern Gaza. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1718.0s)]
*  And the IPC will be able to tell us more, including about the situation in the South. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1723.0s)]
*  Sorry, what was the other question? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1728.0s)]
*  Sorry, on fuel available, running out. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1730.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. Yes, thanks. I beg your pardon, Idit. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1736.0s)]
*  There is, on every two days, we are getting around 100,000 liters of fuel. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1739.0s)]
*  We, I mean the humanitarian organizations, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1747.0s)]
*  UNRWA picks that up on behalf of the humanitarian organization. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1750.0s)]
*  This is just about a third of the daily needs. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1755.0s)]
*  The daily needs are plus minus 300,000 liters. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1759.0s)]
*  So we are getting 100,000 liters. That is by far not enough. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1764.0s)]
*  And we are getting that every other day, not every day. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1768.0s)]
*  So there needs to be a more regular flow of fuel. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1771.0s)]
*  Okay, Abdulhamid, last question. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1778.0s)]
*  Thank you, Juliet, again. This is Abdulhamid. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1780.0s)]
*  I want to ask you about the office in Sheikh Jarrah. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1782.0s)]
*  Is it still closed? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1785.0s)]
*  And what about the training center in Qalandia Refugee Camp, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1786.0s)]
*  which was Israel ordered to close this to the headquarter in Sheikh Jarrah [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1791.0s)]
*  and the training center in Qalandia? Are they still closed? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1797.0s)]
*  Both open and both functional. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1801.0s)]
*  The office in Sheikh Jarrah just closed for the 48 hours after the arson attack [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1804.0s)]
*  by Israeli youngsters who tried to set fire to the compound. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1811.0s)]
*  And it reopened a couple of days later. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1816.0s)]
*  And the office in the training center in Qalandia is open and operational. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1820.0s)]
*  All our operations in the West Bank are on. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1825.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1830.0s)]
*  And I'd like once more to thank our comrade and our colleague Juliet Thuma, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1831.0s)]
*  the spokeswoman for the UN Relief and Works Agency. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1836.0s)]
*  Thank you for your very extensive... [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1839.0s)]
*  I think there's a hand up online. Do you want to take that? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1842.0s)]
*  A handout? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1847.0s)]
*  Someone's raising their hands. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1849.0s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1853.0s)]
*  Yes, I can see. I think Farhan. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1854.0s)]
*  Is that... Okay. Yeah, whoever it is, please log in. I can't quite see you. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1856.0s)]
*  Hi. Can you hear me? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1862.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1864.0s)]
*  Yeah. Hi, Juliet. Hi, Farhan. Thank you for the briefing, Juliet. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1865.0s)]
*  I wanted to go back and ask you about the 200 casualty number that you have [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1869.0s)]
*  for the Sunday night attack. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1875.0s)]
*  Have you been able to confirm these numbers with the Gaza Ministry of Health [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1877.0s)]
*  or any other group operating? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1882.0s)]
*  We received... But now, thanks. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1885.0s)]
*  Like I said, we received this number from an international organization, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1887.0s)]
*  and that is Medical Aid for the Palestinians. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1893.0s)]
*  Do you have any other details on that number? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1897.0s)]
*  No, that's all I have for now. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1901.0s)]
*  But what we do know is among those people killed, there were many women and children. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1903.0s)]
*  Because the number that we all had was 60 from Gaza Ministry. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1914.0s)]
*  So this is significantly higher than the number that was put out. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1918.0s)]
*  You might want to check with MAP UK because the source is MAP UK. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1923.0s)]
*  But this is the number that MAP gave to UNRWA? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1927.0s)]
*  Yes, that gave out, not necessarily to UNRWA. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1930.0s)]
*  Today? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1933.0s)]
*  Today. This afternoon, yeah. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1934.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1936.0s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1938.0s)]
*  Okay. Farhan, I think there is... Iftikhar Ali, I think he wants to say something. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1939.0s)]
*  Okay, yeah. Iftikhar, are you seeking the floor? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1947.0s)]
*  Hello. Can you hear me? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1951.0s)]
*  Yes, we can. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1954.0s)]
*  Just following up on Farhan's question, if this figure of 200 is confirmed, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1956.0s)]
*  would this be... I know 36,000 Palestinians have been killed, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1964.0s)]
*  but would you characterize it if confirmed that this is the biggest death toll in a single strike? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1970.0s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that, Iftikhar. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1979.0s)]
*  And I think you better go back to the source, which is MAP UK. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1983.0s)]
*  And throughout this war, there's been so, so many attacks on civilians. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1988.0s)]
*  And what matters is that many, many, many people have lost their lives totally, totally unnecessarily. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=1994.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=2003.0s)]
*  Is that it from the colleagues online? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=2006.0s)]
*  I think so, Farhan. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=2011.0s)]
*  Okay. All right. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=2013.0s)]
*  Back to you. Thanks so much for having me. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=2014.0s)]
*  Thanks, Juliet. Take care. Good luck. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=2016.0s)]
*  Bye. Thank you. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvx5vrStH0I&t=2019.0s)]
