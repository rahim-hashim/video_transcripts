# Palestine Refugees update - Press Conference UNRWA | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [July 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY)
*  Okay. Hello everybody. Thank you so much for being here on a Friday afternoon. Mr. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=0.0s)]
*  Filipe Lazzarini, as you all know, is a commissioner general for UNRWA. He'll be [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=22.06s)]
*  making some short remarks and then we'll be taking some questions. Thank you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=25.98s)]
*  Thank you so much, Shirin. It's a real pleasure to be with you. Yes, I will try to be short. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=29.900000000000002s)]
*  Though short is not always the case, but sorry for that. We had today the UNRWA pledging conference, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=36.900000000000006s)]
*  which is the annual pledging conference organized by the president of the General [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=44.540000000000006s)]
*  but this morning we had also, you have seen a stake out with a number of member states about [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=50.459999999999994s)]
*  the shared commitment that the countries have vis-a-vis UNRWA. As you know, there have been [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=58.62s)]
*  118 countries having signed this shared commitment. Among them, all the members of the Security [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=65.42s)]
*  Council and basically among the commitment that you heard from the Minister for an Affair of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=72.42s)]
*  this morning, but there is a strong political support of the agency and they are also stressing [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=78.34s)]
*  the indispensable role of the agency. I think it's particularly important at the time the agency is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=85.9s)]
*  under severe attack. There have been quite a number of political attack over the last few months, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=94.42s)]
*  but there have been also, as you know, a number of allegations. Now today during the conference, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=105.5s)]
*  I have stressed the importance of this political supporter also to ensure the role of the agency [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=115.7s)]
*  in a possible transition once a ceasefire and hopefully this fire will once for all be agreed, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=125.62s)]
*  but I believe that the agency has an important role to play in any day in between between a ceasefire [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  and possibly a day after. And I have stressed the importance of education, reminding that the one [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=144.1s)]
*  in two person in Gaza is below the age of 18. That education is the only thing the Palestinian [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=153.78s)]
*  has never ever been dispossessed of. And we have today more than 600,000 girls and boys of the age [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=163.58s)]
*  of primary and secondary school living in the rubble, deeply traumatized and for which I believe [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=174.22s)]
*  we have a common responsibility to bring them back as a matter of urgency into an education setting. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=183.18s)]
*  And basically there is no one beside the state or no one beside the UNHWA which can bring back this [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=192.9s)]
*  number of children to an education setting in such a scale. We are already in a relation with a number [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=202.02s)]
*  of partners where basically we would have a kind of a three-stage approach. The first one is a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=212.94000000000003s)]
*  psychosocial support being provided to the children which by the way is already ongoing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=220.86s)]
*  Secondly, we will have to look at in a second stage to have a safe space where basically we can [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=229.5s)]
*  restart the learning, the reading, the writing, the math. And thirdly, at a later stage, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=239.45999999999998s)]
*  which will require in fact to bring back the children into a formal education setting is also [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=248.1s)]
*  the reconstruction of the school. But to be realistic, the reconstruction of the school [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=255.77999999999997s)]
*  will not take place anytime soon or at least as long as there is no commitment from the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=264.62s)]
*  international community that we are investing into the reconstruction. Maybe just one or two [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=271.18s)]
*  elements regarding the overall humanitarian situation in Gaza. We are already nine months [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=278.22s)]
*  into this war. Displacement basically keeps going on. You have seen over the last week that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  there have been evacuation orders in the Middle Region, in the Middle East, but also evacuation [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=296.42s)]
*  orders in Gaza and in the north. In fact, it's a perpetual movement, a perpetual exodus, and we [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=301.58s)]
*  estimate that in average people are on the move once every month. So it's not uncommon to meet [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=312.46s)]
*  people who have moved since the beginning of the war six, seven, eight times, which is an indication [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=324.29999999999995s)]
*  that there is absolutely no safe space in the Gaza Strip. We are constantly on the edge of a [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=330.53999999999996s)]
*  frontline, constantly on the edge or on the fence of military operation. One thing, and I know that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=338.94s)]
*  you have stressed quite a lot for this, but we keep hearing so many different types of stories. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=350.7s)]
*  You as journalists keep asking us, is it true, is it untrue? We hear narrative. There is another [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=357.1s)]
*  narrative. I know you are asking for months now to have access to Gaza, but I think it's also [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=362.86s)]
*  important to take note that we are nine months in and there is still no international media present [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=370.62s)]
*  in Gaza. I think our national colleagues have made an extraordinary, have been absolutely [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=378.94s)]
*  erratic to try to report from what they describe has been held on Earth, but I think it is also [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=385.98s)]
*  time that once for all you, the international journalists, do have access. You have been, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=394.46000000000004s)]
*  you know, you had access to all the possible war situations across the world. I don't believe that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=400.38s)]
*  Gaza should be an exception. I have also in my intervention this morning beside the Gaza [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=407.18s)]
*  reminded the situation in the West Bank. I keep saying that the West Bank in fact is overshadowed [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=417.26s)]
*  by the situation in Gaza, that if we wouldn't have Gaza today, the West Bank and Israel would [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=426.14s)]
*  definitely hit the headline. More than 500 people have been killed since October 7. Among them, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=433.66s)]
*  135 children. We can see that there have been increased of attack by Israeli settlers, that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=442.62s)]
*  whenever there are military incursions or security operations taking place, they lead also to the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=454.22s)]
*  large scale destruction of home and public infrastructure and this seems to be a pattern, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=461.9s)]
*  a new pattern which has emerged in the West Bank. Last but not least, because we were in a funding [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=470.46s)]
*  and pledging conference today, you know that the agency has gone through a chronic financial crisis [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=478.46s)]
*  for the last 10 years. We certainly have been the only agency operating for years now with a [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=487.66s)]
*  negative cash flow and I can tell you it's highly and deeply unsettling. We always had a mismatch [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=494.78000000000003s)]
*  between what we are expected to deliver and the resource being made available. You remember that [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=501.90000000000003s)]
*  at the beginning of the year when we had the allegation of the 12 staff which became 19 staff [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=509.42s)]
*  allegedly having participated to the massacre of October 7, at that time 16 countries suspended [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=517.1800000000001s)]
*  their contribution to the agency. We are now a few months later, we have the OIO report going on, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=525.58s)]
*  we had the Catherine Colonna report which has been presented to you and today I'm happy to say that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=532.46s)]
*  at the exception of the United States, we cannot resume before March 2025 because of legislative [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=539.9799999999999s)]
*  constraint. All the other countries are back. Now the question is, is the UK back or not? We have [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=548.78s)]
*  signed, I hope that they will be back in the very short period or at least these are the messages [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=556.54s)]
*  that we are receiving. As of today, I can say that we have visibility to function until the end of [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=567.18s)]
*  September. When we started the conference today, I told the Member States that we do not have [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=576.62s)]
*  visibility beyond the month of August. I believe that today we have received a strong message [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=583.26s)]
*  of solidarity, of support. The day started by this commitment by this 118 Member States. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=593.02s)]
*  It has been recalled after that during the pledging conference and we will continue now [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=601.5799999999999s)]
*  our effort to make sure that we can bridge between end of September and the end of the year. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=609.02s)]
*  My concern today is that while we will find, I hope, ways to bridge [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=615.66s)]
*  with the support of the Member States our core activities, we still have an emergency [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=623.9s)]
*  appeal, 1.2 million dollars for the occupied Palestinian territories and 460 million dollars [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=631.5s)]
*  for the Syrian crisis, which remains at this stage severely underfunded because both appeals [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=639.18s)]
*  are only 20 percent funded. So I think, Shireen, I will stop here but obviously available for question. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=647.02s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. Lazzarini, on behalf of the United Nations Correspondence Association. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=661.66s)]
*  Edith Lederer from the Associated Press. Can you give us any figure on how much money was pledged [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=669.42s)]
*  today from donors? I know you said, you just said that you got enough for one month to keep [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=681.0999999999999s)]
*  going but that doesn't sound like a whole lot. And in your opening speech, you talked about the [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=692.22s)]
*  1.2 billion dollars needed for Gaza until the end of the year and then you talked about funding for [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=701.5s)]
*  Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, the rest of the UNRWA operations, also being 20 percent funded. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=714.06s)]
*  Was that the 460 million you were just talking about or was that another number? I'm slightly [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=725.3399999999999s)]
*  confused. Thank you. I am sorry, with numbers we can easily be confused. So I will try to be as [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=732.06s)]
*  didactic as possible. We have a core budget for our core activities which basically covers the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=740.3s)]
*  spending of our 30,000 workforce of the agency where basically we provide all the education, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=748.8599999999999s)]
*  primary health, the human development activity of the agency. That's what we call the core budget, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=756.06s)]
*  the backbone of the organization. The appeal for that is about $850 million. Now when I'm saying [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=762.3s)]
*  that we have visibility until the end of September, I refer to that. I refer to the backbone. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=772.2199999999999s)]
*  In addition, I'm interrupting you. That's for the regular budget. But that's for Gaza, the West Bank, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=779.02s)]
*  Jordan, Syria, Lebanon. Exactly. This is the regular budget, the normal human development [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=789.0999999999999s)]
*  activities that the agency is tasked or mandated to provide to the five million [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=795.9799999999999s)]
*  Palestinian refugees across the region. So that's a regular budget. In addition, whenever there is [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=802.78s)]
*  a humanitarian crisis and we have two big crises in the region, one triggered by Syria, we have an [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=809.8199999999999s)]
*  additional humanitarian appeal for $460 million. That covers the assessed humanitarian need for [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=816.22s)]
*  Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, $460 million. And we have an additional humanitarian appeal for the war [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=825.9s)]
*  in Gaza and the crisis in the West Bank and East Jerusalem for a total amount of $1.2 billion. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=836.14s)]
*  When I say that we are severely underfunded, it's mainly for the humanitarian appeal, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=845.1s)]
*  both for Gaza and the West Bank and the Syrian crisis. The 20 percent refer to that. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=852.3s)]
*  I would love to give you a figure, but I still do not have a final figure. I just ended the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=860.38s)]
*  conference now. I have to see what's repackaging or new money, but I'm confident enough after [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=866.38s)]
*  what I heard today that the agency now has enough resources to function till the end of September. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=874.3s)]
*  I have to say over the last three, four years, I rarely had visibility for more than two, three [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=884.38s)]
*  months. So basically that means the coming couple of months, I will focus to make sure that we are [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=891.9s)]
*  bridging the financial gap between September and the end of December. We continue to work on a, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=899.42s)]
*  you know, hand-to-mouth basis and a monthly basis. And just to make absolutely certain that until the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=907.34s)]
*  end of September includes the appeal for the $1.2 billion appeal, the special appeal for Gaza [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=917.98s)]
*  and money for the special Syrian appeal, there's enough for that until the end of September as well. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=929.98s)]
*  I can tell you that our agency, our staff, we continue to keep school running across the [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=940.22s)]
*  region, health center running. Everybody is paid until end of September. When it comes to the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=948.7s)]
*  emergency appeal, the less we have, the less we can do, the more we have, the more we can do. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=956.22s)]
*  Now we have a pipeline when it comes, for example, to the food supply, to the food distribution, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=962.62s)]
*  which will be running at least till fall. Today already my colleagues are looking at making sure [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=970.22s)]
*  that in fall our pipeline does not break down and that's where the emergency appeal becomes very [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=977.98s)]
*  important. I know it's a little bit complicated, but basically, you know, we have a two portal, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=985.1s)]
*  regular budget, emergency appeal, like any other agency. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=994.0600000000001s)]
*  Okay, let's start with Ibtissam, Bissan, and then Deji. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=999.1800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. My name is Ibtissam Azem, Al-Arabejid newspaper. Good to see you. I want to ask you about [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1003.4200000000001s)]
*  something that you touched upon during your briefing and that's the proposal to designate [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1011.26s)]
*  UNRWA as a terrorist organization by the Israeli authorities. If you could put that in a broader [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1018.38s)]
*  context, what would that mean not only to UNRWA and your operation there, but also to humanitarian [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1026.22s)]
*  and UN systems? And do you feel that you are getting enough support beside lip service from [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1036.14s)]
*  many countries? Are they putting enough pressure on the Israelis against the attacks on your [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1045.82s)]
*  facilities in Jerusalem, etc.? Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, I... [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1053.1s)]
*  all the attack the agency is under is definitely a source of deep concern as far as I'm concerned. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1063.82s)]
*  There are various types of attack. The first one is the blatant disregard of our staff [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1071.18s)]
*  facilities and operation that we have observed in Gaza, for example. Nearly 200 staff killed. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1079.5s)]
*  More than half of our installation have been damaged, sometimes completely destroyed. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1089.02s)]
*  More than 500 people killed in our installation while they were seeking the protection of the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1096.78s)]
*  United Nations. And we have also seen a kind of lip service over the last few months where our [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1102.62s)]
*  installation are used for military purposes, either by Palestinian armed group Hamas or by [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1111.82s)]
*  the Israeli army, but most of the time in places where UNRWA had to vacate. And we have also seen [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1119.18s)]
*  boring trend that number of schools have been targeted over the last few days. Now, in addition [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1128.6200000000001s)]
*  of that, there are political pressure, call to dismantle the agencies. We keep hearing, we have [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1135.66s)]
*  a number of allegations, we have a smearing campaign, we have legislative effort, we have [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1143.9s)]
*  civil lawsuit pressure, we have a demonstration in Jerusalem, the arson attack also, and all this [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1151.02s)]
*  is definitely also fueling, I would say, an atmosphere of fear, anxiety, and a lot of [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1160.46s)]
*  pressure is put on our staff. Are we doing enough? I keep asking Member States. First, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1168.78s)]
*  we need investigative mechanism and ask for accountability for all those who are responsible [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1175.74s)]
*  of blatant disregard of IHL, of our staff and premises, because if we don't do this, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1183.82s)]
*  this will become the new norm anywhere else. Secondly, I mean, there is absolutely, I make, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1192.7s)]
*  I have absolutely no illusion, you know, today there are attack on UNRWA, tomorrow it can be [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1200.3000000000002s)]
*  an attack on any other UN organization or any other international organization, and we have to [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1208.46s)]
*  push back to make sure that this is not becoming a new norm. And when it comes to the attempt [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1216.86s)]
*  to label the organization as a terrorist organization, would we, would this be the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1224.6999999999998s)]
*  case or would this happen? Basically, that might also become the new norm anywhere else in the [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1232.3s)]
*  world whenever we want to get rid of an organization or an humanitarian organization, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1239.66s)]
*  basically in any kind of conflict situation or autocratic type of environment, you just [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1246.22s)]
*  label terrorists to get rid of the organization. So there is a real danger, and I keep, I mean, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1253.18s)]
*  drawing the attention of the Member States that we have to vehemently push back against this type of [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1259.9s)]
*  attack because these are also assault on our, you know, on the multilateralism, on our shared value [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1267.58s)]
*  within the international community. Are we doing enough? We can always do more, and there is no [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1276.78s)]
*  doubt about that. Thank you. Yeah, Bissan. Thank you very much, Bissan. I'll quick with Al-Jazeera [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1283.5s)]
*  Arabic. The U.S. signed the declaration this morning, but they did not clearly participate [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1288.9399999999998s)]
*  in the conference. How do you think or what visibility do you have that their signing of [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1295.74s)]
*  this declaration might be translated into since they cannot actually resume funding before next [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1303.02s)]
*  year given the, what has been passed by Congress? And I have another question, too. You mentioned [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1310.38s)]
*  that UNRWA is the agency that is better equipped clearly to bring back children in Gaza to schools, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1319.02s)]
*  but of course there's going to be a reconstruction process. I mean, I know this is hypothetical, but [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1326.94s)]
*  how much time would it take if there is a ceasefire to actually get this going, and would more money [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1332.78s)]
*  be needed for that reconstruction effort given what has happened to UNRWA schools and them being [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1340.78s)]
*  targeted? I think on the first question, you have to ask the question in Washington and the [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1347.18s)]
*  administration, but it was a very good sign to have the United States joining the 117 other countries [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1355.9s)]
*  for the shared commitment vis-a-vis UNRWA, which indicates that they are also providing the necessary [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1365.5800000000002s)]
*  political support to the agency, and it's important for other countries also to know that [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1373.18s)]
*  there is such a support. When it comes to the reconstruction, I think we really have to look at [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1378.8600000000001s)]
*  a phased approach. I keep talking about the day in between, in fact, because I believe [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1387.3400000000001s)]
*  that there will be a long period between the day there will be a ceasefire and the day we can really [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1395.42s)]
*  talk about the day after the reconstruction. There will be a long period during which, you know, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1402.54s)]
*  if you start to invest into reconstruction, you need also to have the necessary trust and confidence [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1410.1399999999999s)]
*  that you can invest development money and reconstruction money into Gaza Strip, and this [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1416.94s)]
*  will very much depend on the political solution being on the table and the level of trust, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1423.8999999999999s)]
*  the various parties will have vis-a-vis this political solution, which also needs to be time [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1432.06s)]
*  bound. So it's extremely difficult to talk about a timeline when we talk about reconstruction, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1437.98s)]
*  but what I am saying and warning is we do not have the luxury of time when it comes to bring back [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1444.3s)]
*  these children into an education environment, and we have to do so before even we start to [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1452.86s)]
*  rebuild the school. We have to find ways because the more we will be waiting, the more we will be [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1460.46s)]
*  sowing the seeds for more, you know, resentment, for more despair, and the children will be more [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1467.26s)]
*  and more exposed to possible recruitment with a new criminal group or armed group in the Gaza Strip, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1476.3s)]
*  and that would also mean the sacrifice of a generation. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1485.42s)]
*  Deji and then Abdulhamid and then Mike. Hi Mr. Lazzarini. Deji Xu with China Central [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1493.02s)]
*  Television. I'm sorry, I got a couple of questions. First, I want to ask for a clarification. You just [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1497.8200000000002s)]
*  mentioned that our school, our facilities has been used by Hamas and Israel military. You said that. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1503.3400000000001s)]
*  Is that the case? I am saying that we keep receiving allegation report of, you know, discovery [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1511.0200000000002s)]
*  of harms being hided. We can see sometimes on video, in social media, that you have armed people [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1522.14s)]
*  in UNRWA premises. We see in some social media video of presence of the Israeli army in UN premises. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1533.5s)]
*  So basically, there are multiple allegations and reports of UN premises being used by armed [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1544.3s)]
*  element. That's also the reason why, I mean, I cannot tell you what happened when these are [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1554.78s)]
*  all places which have been vacated, and this is also the reason why I do believe we will need, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1562.7s)]
*  we need a board of inquiry once the environment permits to clearly understand [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1570.46s)]
*  what happened and who was responsible. Okay, so actually my questions are, sorry, first, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1578.94s)]
*  obviously you have to deal with the Israeli officials and they are also labeling [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1586.62s)]
*  UNRWA, trying to label UNRWA as terrorist group. How would you describe the sentiment when you're [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1594.7s)]
*  talking with Israeli official officers about your cooperation? And second, you mentioned that $1.2 [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1601.1s)]
*  billion for the emergency Gaza appeal, and you said you cannot really predict that long term. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1610.54s)]
*  But we heard here repeatedly that it's a very optimistic, opportunistic operation in Gaza. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1620.2199999999998s)]
*  So for this $1.2 billion, how are you going to spend it if you don't have a very stable or, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1628.46s)]
*  let's say, frequent operation inside Gaza? Thank you. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1637.5s)]
*  You know, right now it's extraordinarily difficult to operate in Gaza, and I'm sure that you heard [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1643.5s)]
*  many of my colleagues who came here to describe to you the challenges due to the collapse of the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1651.74s)]
*  law and order, of civil order, the chaotic type of environment, the looting, the hindrances due to [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1662.06s)]
*  the military operation, the difficulties we have also in the confliction. So the operating [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1673.5s)]
*  environment is extraordinarily difficult nowadays. Now when we talk about an appeal of $1.2 billion, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1679.98s)]
*  it's also based on an environment where we can properly operate. Today, you know, we are talking [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1689.02s)]
*  about collectively from the UN agencies of 40, 50 trucks coming in in an ideal environment, and if [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1696.22s)]
*  we would just collectively try to cover all the humanitarian needs, we would need much more than [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1705.98s)]
*  that. So again, the $1.2 billion is based on the most critical assessed humanitarian needs, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1713.26s)]
*  but the environment today does not allow us to fully deploy the capacity we would have, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1723.1s)]
*  would the environment be conducive for that. Now the second question is more about, you know, the [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1731.1s)]
*  communication between you and the Israeli officials. Well, I mean, you know, there is always, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1741.1799999999998s)]
*  and I keep reminding this, two levels of communication. We have the pragmatic and [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1746.06s)]
*  operational communication which takes place on a day-to-day basis, sometimes hour-to-hour basis, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1750.9399999999998s)]
*  with the Kogat, with the army in Gaza, and then you have, I would say, the more political type of [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1758.5400000000002s)]
*  communication where indeed here you have more of this, I would say, information, counter information [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1768.38s)]
*  type of situation, allegation, smearing campaign, you say, we say, and that's the reason why also [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1776.6200000000001s)]
*  sometimes it would be good that in addition to the you say, we say, that the journalists be also [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1786.14s)]
*  present and can make their own opinion on what is really going in places like Gaza. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1794.22s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Lazarini. Nice to see you again. I have a few questions as well. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1805.5800000000002s)]
*  This is Abdul Hamid Sayam from Al-Quds Al-Arabi. Last Saturday there was an attack on Al-Jauni [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1812.0600000000002s)]
*  UNRWA school. Sixteen people were killed, 56 wounded. You voice your concern and you ask for [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1821.1000000000001s)]
*  investigation. You have been asking for investigation again and again and again, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1829.18s)]
*  not one single incident was investigated. But when there was allegations against UNRWA, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1834.54s)]
*  immediately two tracks of investigation, not one but two. Why is that? That's one question. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1841.4199999999998s)]
*  Second, normally if the pro-Israeli advocates, they attack the agency, if they cannot dismantle it, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1848.78s)]
*  then they try to attack the person the way they did with, for example, Pierre Cranbourg. They [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1856.86s)]
*  attacked him personally. Are you concerned about yourself? I think you are a saint. There is nothing [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1862.94s)]
*  they can't catch you about. Otherwise they will attack you personally. Are you concerned about that? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1869.42s)]
*  And last but not least, how do you see the concept of the right of return, which is in fact, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1875.8200000000002s)]
*  it is the target of all this smearing campaign against UNRWA? Thank you. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1887.18s)]
*  I will start with the last question. I think I have been clear, for example, today again [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1894.3s)]
*  with the member state that let's do no mistake. All the attack against the agency are ultimately [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1901.18s)]
*  politically motivated. I do not believe it's a question of neutrality. We had a review and I'm [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1911.74s)]
*  very happy that we had this track and this review because it has helped in fact to address, I would [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1919.26s)]
*  say, a problem of perception with our donors. It was important that the review tells them that [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1927.02s)]
*  UNRWA has a system of risk management which are more robust than any other UN agency or international [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1935.5s)]
*  organization, but because of the context we are operating in, deeply polarized, deeply politicized, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1944.94s)]
*  and because of our footprint and particularity, we can still do more and hence the 50 recommendations [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1956.3s)]
*  of Catherine Colon's report that we have agreed and embraced. So that was important. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1963.9s)]
*  But I also keep saying the members, let's do no mistake, the attack ultimately are politically [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1971.26s)]
*  motivated. They are aiming at stripping the Palestinian from the refugee statue and through [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1976.94s)]
*  this they are aiming at undermining the aspiration to self-determination of the Palestinian and for [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1984.3000000000002s)]
*  some most likely also to undermine the two-state solution being on the table. So that's [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=1993.1s)]
*  I believe that part of these concerted attacks are politically motivated. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2002.78s)]
*  Would I take the same decision today with the 12th or 19th staff? Yes, I would at that time [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2015.6599999999999s)]
*  I knew that if the agency, first of all the nature of the allegation was absolutely terrible, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2023.5s)]
*  was unprecedented as an agency. I also say that would these people be recognized responsible, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2031.02s)]
*  would, I would say that would be a terrible betrayal vis-a-vis the Palestinian refugees [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2040.3799999999999s)]
*  and the mandate of the agency. But I think it was very important, I think it was very important [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2046.6999999999998s)]
*  to take at that time to take the necessary action and this were actions the agency could take. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2053.02s)]
*  When it comes to the investigation or board of inquiry that I'm calling for, when it comes to [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2060.38s)]
*  the attack on the premises, it's very different because we are still in a war zone, we are still [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2066.7s)]
*  military operation going on and if you want to do an investigation you have to send people [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2073.66s)]
*  on the ground to you know to collect information, to have a foreign seek [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2080.7s)]
*  evidence and for the time being it's impossible to conduct an independent investigation of this [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2088.22s)]
*  nature. I really hope that once we have a ceasefire, once the environment becomes more conducive, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2094.8599999999997s)]
*  that such type of investigation take place. It has taken place in 2014 [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2102.7s)]
*  following the attack on some of our premises. We are now in 2024 and the scale is just cannot [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2110.06s)]
*  be compared to what happened in 2014 but at least we had already a precedent at that time. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2120.3799999999997s)]
*  Thank you. Mike, please go ahead. Mr. Commissioner General, welcome back to New York. Mike Wagenheim [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2126.78s)]
*  with I-24 News. I had two questions for you, I want to ask them separately. Building on the you say, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2133.02s)]
*  we say theme that you talked about a few moments ago, UNRWA has been handling the count of [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2138.86s)]
*  humanitarian aid going into Gaza which, and please correct me if I'm wrong, OCHE handled this in [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2144.54s)]
*  previous conflicts. It's now under UNRWA's auspices. UNRWA was told for many months by [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2150.62s)]
*  COGAD and by other analysts that its count was wrong, that it was off by exponentially. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2158.14s)]
*  The IPC's famine review committee came out with a report last month confirming that, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2166.2999999999997s)]
*  that it simply has not been counting certain points of entry, hasn't been counting the correct [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2171.18s)]
*  amount of trucks coming in, hasn't been counting private food sources coming in. The difference [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2176.62s)]
*  between starvation and survival essentially is how far UNRWA has been off. Why did UNRWA persist [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2183.1s)]
*  and insist for so long on keeping what was known to be an incorrect count of humanitarian aid coming [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2191.02s)]
*  in? Thank you. I think you are mixing two things. One is the convoys and the counting [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2197.74s)]
*  of what comes into Gaza and the second one is the IPC and the IPC basically is to measure how acute [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2206.8599999999997s)]
*  the malnutrition could be in Gaza and this is measured by, you know, experts from [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2217.2599999999998s)]
*  WFP, FAO, UNICEF and so on and they don't count the number of trucks coming in. They look at [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2225.1s)]
*  what's available in the market for the people and do people have access to what is available [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2231.26s)]
*  or not available because basically this is what is causing malnutrition. So that's the IPC. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2238.0600000000004s)]
*  When it comes to the counting, I mean let's be extremely clear, UNRWA has been only present [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2245.1000000000004s)]
*  in Rafa when it was open and in Karim Shalom. We have not been present anywhere else. So we can [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2251.9s)]
*  monitor only what comes in for the broader UN community and basically that was the entry in [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2259.66s)]
*  Rafa and that was the entry in Karim Shalom that we were operating. Secondly, they have been also [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2268.7s)]
*  and here is if you do, I'm not an expert, but if you talk to people on the ground they are also [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2275.58s)]
*  saying oh there is a discrepancy on the number of trucks. You have smaller trucks [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2281.9s)]
*  going to Karim Shalom and dropping their goods and you have larger trucks inside Gaza [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2288.94s)]
*  going to pick up. So if you need two trucks to come in and one truck's in, we basically count the [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2295.9s)]
*  trucks we are dealing with because basically that's what's being moved in Gaza. So here I know that [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2303.58s)]
*  there have been different ways of counting. I was asked recently in a press conference, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2310.3s)]
*  who is telling the truth? I say everyone is telling his own truth when it comes to [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2318.3s)]
*  the trucks and what is coming in, but the way of counting has been different and we are also [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2323.7400000000002s)]
*  talking about different size of trucks. But ultimately when we talk about how bad is [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2330.54s)]
*  the malnutrition, how bad is the hunger in Gaza, it has nothing to do with counting trucks in a [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2338.86s)]
*  crossing point. It has all to do with what is really available and accessible for the people [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2347.5s)]
*  and if it is not available and not accessible that's where it starts to impact people and the [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2356.46s)]
*  IPC has been very clear. Hunger has spread all across Gaza and you had a pocket of acute malnutrition [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2363.98s)]
*  phase four, phase five looming, edging close to a situation of famine and starvation in some pocket. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2373.6600000000003s)]
*  At one point it was north and later on, the air reds started to open, less people in the north. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2382.94s)]
*  The situation has been stabilized and slightly reversed and then in the south where the situation [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2390.54s)]
*  was better until during the month of April, all of suddenly started to deteriorate again. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2397.58s)]
*  At the time, RAFA started to shut down, less could come in from Karim Shalom. People were moved [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2405.18s)]
*  again at multiple occasions in the center and again they have been pocketed where the situation [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2412.54s)]
*  has again deteriorated. The IPC and the calculation of what comes in are two unrelated [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2419.98s)]
*  exercises. So a quick follow-up then, if UNRWA doesn't have the resources to staff [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2431.5s)]
*  all of the entry points and doesn't have the resources to count the private [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2437.1s)]
*  of food deliveries coming in, the commercial food deliveries which the IPC also noted, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2441.5s)]
*  what good is its numbers to begin with if they're not reflecting the reality? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2446.8599999999997s)]
*  Listen, UNRWA has been authorized to be present only in Karim Shalom and in RAFA. UNRWA was not [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2451.98s)]
*  authorized to be anywhere else as a starting point. Secondly, UNRWA has always contributed [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2460.7s)]
*  to the counting of trucks we were handling for the broader UN community and the humanitarian [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2469.98s)]
*  community. That's what we are doing. We are not handling for the commercial sector. Now, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2477.1s)]
*  people are saying the commercial sector came in, more came in. The question after that, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2482.46s)]
*  people were saying, well, they came in with goods that no one really could have access [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2487.5s)]
*  because they cannot afford to buy what they brought in to the market. So that's a different, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2491.66s)]
*  again, but it's a discussion which is impacting the discussion on the IPC on [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2497.42s)]
*  do we have access or can we afford access to the food being made available? Now, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2503.26s)]
*  for the humanitarian community, we have a humanitarian coordinator on OCHA which [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2511.7400000000002s)]
*  consolidate all the information we are receiving and we contribute to this. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2517.58s)]
*  Second question. I tried to contact your office for an answer and they didn't get back to me, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2522.8599999999997s)]
*  but I know you guys have your hands full. There is an allegation made in a civil lawsuit here [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2529.58s)]
*  and filed in New York that UNRWA's policy in Gaza is to distribute aid in US dollars in cash and [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2536.06s)]
*  that policy only applies in Gaza. It does not apply in the Palestinian territories in Judea and [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2544.54s)]
*  Samaria. It does not apply in Lebanon. It does not apply in Syria. Is that factually correct? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2549.86s)]
*  Factually, if I remember well, they talk also about salaries being paid only in dollar in [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2556.1800000000003s)]
*  Gaza. This is factually incorrect. Not just salaries, but aid as well. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2564.9s)]
*  I'm saying salaries was the main issue in this lawsuit. We pay salaries in dollar in Lebanon [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2570.1800000000003s)]
*  and we pay also our staff in Syria on dollar base like we do in Gaza. Ultimately, the distribution, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2577.62s)]
*  if you talk about the cash assistance, if I'm not mistaken, I say if it's in Shekel. It's not in [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2587.94s)]
*  dollar. But our reference of what we are doing, it's always at the beginning because our budget [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2595.38s)]
*  are in dollar, our contribution are in dollar, but the cash which would be distributed would be in [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2602.82s)]
*  Shekel. But I can come back to you to be 100% sure. That's my instinctive answer to you. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2607.94s)]
*  Last thing isn't a question, just a comment. I know you tried to submit a letter to an Israeli [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2616.98s)]
*  newspaper in Hebrew to reach out to the Israeli public with your thoughts and your sentiments [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2621.54s)]
*  and that newspaper, I guess, rejected that particular letter. You're more than welcome [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2628.02s)]
*  anytime to speak to the Israeli public through my outlet and we'll be happy to have you. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2632.6600000000003s)]
*  Thank you. This is well noted. Can I just clarify this? You might know that I issued an essay in [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2637.0600000000004s)]
*  the New York Times and basically there is 30 days of copyright and after 30 days, this essay has been [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2644.5800000000004s)]
*  offered to other newspaper and that's what was offered. So it was not a different paper [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2652.9s)]
*  than the essay published in the New York Times. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2658.42s)]
*  other questions in the room? Online, I see somebody's hand or are you just waving goodbye? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2663.78s)]
*  Please speak up. Yes, I have a question for Mr. Lazzarini. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2671.62s)]
*  Lazzarini, Stefano Vacara, La Voce di New York, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2677.14s)]
*  Italpress. I know it's not your decision, but if the Security Council asks you an opinion [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2680.5s)]
*  on a UN mission, a UN peace mission for Gaza, what would be your answer? Do you think it's a [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2692.1s)]
*  good idea and something similar to UNIFIL or do you think that for Gaza it's not a good idea? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2704.74s)]
*  My honest answer right now is I don't know what I would advise because it all depends on [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2715.7s)]
*  where we are in terms of political solution, what has been negotiated or not negotiated. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2722.5s)]
*  Is this something that everybody wants or is it opposed by certain parties? I think I need [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2732.58s)]
*  more element before being able to articulate even an advice. I won't be asked because I'm just [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2739.3s)]
*  the commissioner of UNHWA and not necessarily a political expert, but I would expect that anyone [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2748.1s)]
*  providing an advice would need a little bit more element. But I know that the issue of [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2754.82s)]
*  international presence pops up from time to time in some discussion that shows also [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2762.82s)]
*  the collective difficulties we have right now to envision what a day after might look like [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2772.6600000000003s)]
*  in the context of Gaza right now. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2780.7400000000002s)]
*  Can we just take two more questions? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2786.58s)]
*  Let's start with Gabriel and then we go to Abdulhamid. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2791.46s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Lazzarini. I know it's been a long day. I appreciate you taking another question for [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2795.38s)]
*  me. I just want to clarify, most of my colleagues have asked all my questions, but I just want to [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2799.54s)]
*  clarify, you said of the 16 countries that paused or suspended funding to UNHWA after [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2805.06s)]
*  the Israeli allegations, 15 of those countries have come back. Is that correct? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2811.38s)]
*  I said most came back, 14 officially came back, and I believe that very soon I will be able to say [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2817.38s)]
*  15 came back. Okay, thank you. Thanks for that clarification. Just one last question. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2827.62s)]
*  I'm just taking a step back for a second. Have you thought about how this conflict has changed UNHWA [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2835.14s)]
*  forever? How the organization might change in the future once this conflict is over? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2844.5s)]
*  I keep asking myself this question. I was even asking myself this question before October 7, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2855.54s)]
*  and one of the questions I tried always to envision was this year we are marking the 75th. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2864.5s)]
*  75th UNHWA exists because there is no political solution, let's be clear, but then the question [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2874.1s)]
*  I wanted to ask to Member States was, but what if the next symbolic anniversary, which might be [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2880.6600000000003s)]
*  100 years, there is still no political solution? Would the international community still fund [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2890.66s)]
*  and renew the mandate of an agency like ours providing public-like services to one of the [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2900.8199999999997s)]
*  most destitute communities in the region? And I tried to bring this question on the table to try [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2906.8999999999996s)]
*  to collectively start to think about, you know, not changing the mandate, but we were in such [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2914.02s)]
*  a situation where our main existential threat was the financial crisis, the discrepancy and the [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2922.66s)]
*  tension between what we are asked to deliver and the expectation and the resource being made available. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2931.22s)]
*  And we all know that before this, you know, this tragedy we are all witnessing and this [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2939.78s)]
*  systemic transformation in the region, before the conflict was not a priority anymore of the [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2950.7400000000002s)]
*  international community, it was deprioritized and we started to deeply suffer from this [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2959.46s)]
*  indifference. Everybody suffered, the political process was stalled, there was absolutely nothing, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2967.06s)]
*  no one knew in which direction it was going, but we as an agency became the proxy of that. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2971.54s)]
*  So I tried to bring this conversation. Now today, yes, it is important, there is a discussion about [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2979.1400000000003s)]
*  what could be, what should be the role of UNHWA in Gaza now on the day in between, the day after. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2986.02s)]
*  I do believe that our main comparative advantage is education, its primary health. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=2994.74s)]
*  No one else is in a position to provide these services in Gaza, but when it comes to [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3005.46s)]
*  rebuilding the hardware, that's not necessarily where we have a comparative advantage and anyway [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3014.42s)]
*  it is destroyed to such a scale that only bigger institutions used to that [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3021.62s)]
*  can do a better job than we would do. So yes, there is quite a number of reflection going on. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3029.14s)]
*  Now I don't have the answer in two words. Appreciate it. Well, if you keep it short [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3035.94s)]
*  because I think we're done. First, I strongly wish that you say Karim Abu Salim and not [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3044.9s)]
*  that's my inability to. That's second. And the second question fast, when was the last time you [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3056.1800000000003s)]
*  were in Gaza and if you want to go now, will you be prevented from going to Gaza now as we speak? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3064.02s)]
*  As I speak, I have asked to go I think two, three weeks ago, three weeks ago, and I haven't received [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3071.62s)]
*  the authorization. As we speak today, my visa for Jerusalem is not yet renewed. Okay. Thank you. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3079.8599999999997s)]
*  And last, there was a memorandum signed by UNHWA and Israel right after the occupation of 1967. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3089.46s)]
*  Very important memorandum of understanding. Can you make it available to us? When was it signed? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3097.7s)]
*  1967 after the occupation. Israel was very concerned about the UNHWA services to be cut off [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3105.14s)]
*  from the refugees and they might revolt. So the military leader, military governor of Israel [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3112.1s)]
*  rushed to UNHWA office in Sheikh Jarrah and signed a memorandum of understanding. Very detailed one. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3118.1s)]
*  Could it be available? First of all, I need to know if I can find this memorandum. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3124.98s)]
*  So thank you for the information. We'll ask my team to look into it and once I'm aware of this [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3132.1000000000004s)]
*  memorandum, I will let you know if I can make it available. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3140.5s)]
*  I think we're done with the questions. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3145.78s)]
*  Oh, I think everybody knows. The United Kingdom, you know, is today they have announced that they are [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3154.26s)]
*  looking at coming back. I don't, you know, the decision is not taken but they are reviewing [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3165.86s)]
*  their position regarding the funding. Thank you so much. And I have expressed some optimism [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3174.1000000000004s)]
*  on this one. Thank you so much. Thank you everybody. Thank you, Mr. Lazzarini. Thank you. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McoLrnRuafY&t=3180.42s)]
