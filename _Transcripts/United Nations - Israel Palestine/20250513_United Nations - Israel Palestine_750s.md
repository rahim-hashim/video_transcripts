Video Description: Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher today (13 May) asked the Security Council Members “to reflect for a moment on what action we will tell future generations we each took to stop the 21st century atrocity to which we bear daily witness in Gaza.”

Fletcher, briefing the Council on the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave, said, “Israel is deliberately un unashamedly imposing inhumane conditions on civilians in the occupied Palestinian territory. For more than ten weeks. Nothing has entered Gaza. No food, medicine, water, or tents. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have again been forcibly displaced and confined into ever shrinking spaces, as 70 percent of Gaza's territory is either within Israeli militarized zones or under displacement orders.”

The humanitarian official said Israel denies humanitarians access, “placing the objective of depopulating Gaza before the lives of civilians.”

He said, “we have lifesaving supplies ready now at the borders. We can save hundreds of thousands of survivors. We have rigorous mechanisms to ensure our aid gets to civilians, and not to Hamas. But

He asked Council Members, “what more evidence do you need now? Will you act decisively to prevent genocide and to ensure respect for international humanitarian law? Or will you say instead that we did all we could?”

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Director of its Liaison Office with the United Nations, Angélica Jácome, told the Council that “agrifood systems have collapsed in the Gaza Strip while food prices have soared.”

Jácome said, “we are witnessing the systemic breakdown of conditions essential for survival. People in Gaza are not only experiencing lack of food, but they are going through a profound breakdown of health, livelihood, and social structures, leaving entire communities in a state of desperation, devastation, and death.”

Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour told the Council that “930,000 children are at critical risk of famine” in Gaza, “not because there is no food. Food is there. A few meters away. Rotting instead of reaching those who desperately need it. But because Israel has been openly and brazenly blocking humanitarian aid for over two months now.”

Mansour said, “this is engineered starvation. It is the most inhumane form of torture and killing.”

He noted that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had told the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the Israeli Knesset on Sunday “we are destroying more and more homes. They have nowhere to return to. The only inevitable outcome will be the wish of Gazans to immigrate outside of the Gaza Strip.”

For his part, Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon said, “we will not accept a humanitarian mechanism that props up the terror organization that butchered our people. We will not sit idly by as food, fuel and funds meant for civilians are funnelled into the Hamas terror machine. We will never allow our morality to be weaponized against us again.”

Danon said Secretary-General António Guterres had “refused to engage” in a new humanitarian distribution plan proposed by Israel, alleging that the plan “in his view, does not meet the principles of and I quote, ‘impartiality, humanity, independence and neutrality.”

The Israeli Ambassador said, “the irony is unbelievable, as the previous mechanism made a mockery of every one of those principles. That is not diplomacy. That is not neutrality. That is sabotage disguised as principle.”

Danon said, “to Secretary-General Guterres I say this; the aid that ended up in Hamas hands did not bring hope. It did not bring progress. It brought death. That path leads nowhere, Mr. Guterres, you are invited to return to the table. But if you do come with open eyes, and open ears, something can be achieved.”

# Gaza: UN Urges Immediate Action to Save Lives - OCHA Briefing | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU)
*  Mr. President, members of the Council, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=0.0s)]
*  Briefing you again on this subject is a grim undertaking. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=6.8s)]
*  Before starting, I ask you to reflect for a moment on what action we will tell future [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=12.98s)]
*  generations we each took to stop the 21st century atrocity to which we bear daily witness [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=26.580000000000002s)]
*  It is a question we will hear, sometimes incredulous, sometimes furious, but always there for the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=29.42s)]
*  rest of our lives. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=36.88s)]
*  We will surely all claim to have been against it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=40.08s)]
*  Maybe we will say we issued a statement, or that we trusted that private pressure might [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=45.22s)]
*  work despite so much evidence to the contrary. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=51.38s)]
*  Or pretend that we thought a more brutal military offensive had more chance of bringing [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=57.02s)]
*  the hostages home than the negotiations which brought so many hostages home. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=61.92s)]
*  Maybe some will recall that in a transactional world we had other priorities. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=69.74000000000001s)]
*  Or maybe we will use those empty words, we did all we could. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=76.68s)]
*  Mr. President, let me start with what we see and are mandated by this Council to report. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=85.42s)]
*  Israel is deliberately and unashamedly imposing inhumane conditions on civilians in the occupied [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=93.18s)]
*  Palestinian territory. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=100.14s)]
*  For more than 10 weeks nothing has entered Gaza, no food, medicine, water or tents. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=102.94s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have again been forcibly displaced and confined [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=111.24s)]
*  into ever-shrinking spaces. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=117.08s)]
*  As 70% of Gaza's territory is either within Israeli militarised zones or under displacement [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=120.4s)]
*  orders. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=128.72s)]
*  As my colleague from the FAO will explain, every single one of the 2.1 million Palestinians [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=131.4s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip face the risk of famine. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=139.1s)]
*  One in five face starvation. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=145.82000000000002s)]
*  Despite the fact that you have funded the food that could save them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=151.18s)]
*  The few hospitals that have somehow survived bombardment are overwhelmed. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=157.9s)]
*  The medics who have somehow survived drone and sniper attacks cannot keep up with the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=162.38s)]
*  trauma and the spread of disease. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=167.08s)]
*  Even today the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Yunis was bombed again with even more civilian [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=170.76s)]
*  casualties reported. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=177.36s)]
*  I can tell you from having visited what's left of Gaza's medical system that death [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=181.52s)]
*  on this scale has a sound and a smell that does not leave you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=186.52s)]
*  As one hospital worker described it, children scream as we peel burnt fabric from their skin. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=193.5s)]
*  And yet we hear that we did all we could. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=201.82s)]
*  Mr President, our response as humanitarians is to make a single ask of the Council. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  Let us work. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=213.26s)]
*  The UN and our partners are desperate to resume humanitarian aid at scale across Gaza in line [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=215.33999999999997s)]
*  with the fundamental principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=223.44s)]
*  We have a plan. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=231.11999999999998s)]
*  We have shown we can deliver with tens of thousands of trucks reaching civilians during [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  the ceasefire. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=238.42s)]
*  We have life-saving supplies ready now at the borders. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=240.5s)]
*  We can save hundreds of thousands of survivors. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=245.48s)]
*  We have rigorous mechanisms to ensure our aid gets to civilians and not to Hamas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=250.14s)]
*  But Israel denies us access, placing the objective of depopulating Gaza before the lives of civilians. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=258.4s)]
*  It is bad enough that the blockade continues. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=266.62s)]
*  How do you react when Israeli ministers boast of it? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=270.4s)]
*  Or when attacks on humanitarian workers and violations of the UN's privileges and immunities [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=275.94s)]
*  continue along with restrictions on international and non-governmental organisations? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=280.48s)]
*  Mr President, this Council has adopted resolutions that demand all parties to the conflict comply [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=286.98s)]
*  with international humanitarian law and protection of civilians, including humanitarian personnel. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=294.98s)]
*  A reminder that Israel also has clear obligations under international humanitarian law. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=303.16s)]
*  It must treat civilians humanely, with respect for their inherent human dignity. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=309.76s)]
*  It must not forcibly transfer, deport or displace the civilian population of an occupied territory. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=315.72s)]
*  As the occupying power, it must agree to aid and facilitate it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=324.04s)]
*  So for anyone still pretending to be in any doubt, the Israeli-designed distribution modality [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=329.76s)]
*  is not the answer. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=335.94s)]
*  It practically excludes many, including people with disabilities, women, children, the elderly, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=338.74s)]
*  the wounded. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=344.52s)]
*  It forces further displacement. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=346.02s)]
*  It exposes thousands of people to harm. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=349.3s)]
*  It sets an unacceptable precedent for aid delivery not just in the OPT, but around the world. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=352.94s)]
*  It restricts aid to only one part of Gaza, while leaving other dire needs unmet. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=361.58s)]
*  It makes aid conditional on political and military aims. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=369.06s)]
*  It makes starvation a bargaining chip. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  It is a cynical sideshow, a deliberate distraction, a fig leaf for further violence and displacement. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=378.9s)]
*  If any of that still matters, have no part in it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=387.78s)]
*  Mr President, for the record, we have tried. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=392.85999999999996s)]
*  The UN has met 12 times, and again this morning, with the Israeli authorities to discuss this [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=396.41999999999996s)]
*  proposed modality. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=402.44s)]
*  We wanted to find a way to make it possible. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=405.14000000000004s)]
*  We repeatedly explained the minimum conditions for our involvement on the basis of long-settled [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=409.62s)]
*  fundamental principles. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=415.98s)]
*  Aid based on independent assessments of who needs it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=418.3s)]
*  The globally tested and donor-demanded basic requirement. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=422.02000000000004s)]
*  And the ability to deliver aid to all those in need, wherever they are. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=427.26000000000005s)]
*  The Secretary-General set out the relevant international law in his submissions to the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=434.26s)]
*  International Court of Justice. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=438.7s)]
*  And your resolutions have strongly condemned starvation of civilians as a method of warfare [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=441.58s)]
*  and the unlawful denial of humanitarian access. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=447.62s)]
*  Resolution 2417 demands the Council's full attention to widespread conflict-induced food [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=452.02s)]
*  insecurity. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=458.09999999999997s)]
*  Mr President, it's not just Gaza. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=461.26s)]
*  Appalling violence is also increasing in the West Bank, where the situation is the worst [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=464.46s)]
*  in decades. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=468.98s)]
*  The use of heavy weaponry, military methods of war, excessive force, forcible displacement, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=470.98s)]
*  demolitions and movement restrictions. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=476.42s)]
*  Ongoing illegal settlement expansion. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=479.7s)]
*  Entire communities destroyed, refugee camps depopulated. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=483.86s)]
*  Violence expanding and settler violence continuing at alarming levels. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=488.18s)]
*  Sometimes with the support of Israeli forces. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=493.62s)]
*  Recently settlers abducted a 13-year-old girl and her 3-year-old brother. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=499.14s)]
*  They were found tied to a tree. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=503.54s)]
*  Do we also say to them that we did all we could? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=507.18s)]
*  Mr President, there is, I fear, a broader context here. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=512.86s)]
*  For the past 19 months, Palestinian journalists, civil society and individuals have live-streamed [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=518.5s)]
*  their destruction to the world. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=523.9399999999999s)]
*  Many have been targeted and killed for their testimony. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=527.3399999999999s)]
*  During this time, international aid workers have been the only international civilian [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=532.5s)]
*  presence in Gaza, watching and reporting the unfolding horror. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=538.14s)]
*  We are your eyes and your ears. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=544.6999999999999s)]
*  And be in no doubt that we feel the weight of that responsibility. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=548.78s)]
*  To you, to the communities we serve and to the world. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=552.62s)]
*  And so we have briefed this council in great detail on the extensive civilian harm that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=557.98s)]
*  we witness daily. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=563.5400000000001s)]
*  Death, injury, destruction, hunger, disease, torture, other cruel, inhuman or degrading [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=565.02s)]
*  treatment, repeated displacement on a large scale. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=572.4200000000001s)]
*  We have described the deliberate obstruction of aid operations and the systematic dismantling [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=577.58s)]
*  of Palestinian life and that which sustains it in Gaza. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=582.7s)]
*  So you have that information. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=588.3000000000001s)]
*  And now the ICJ is considering whether a genocide is taking place in Gaza. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=591.14s)]
*  It will weigh the testimony that we have shared. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=598.6999999999999s)]
*  But it will be too late. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=602.9799999999999s)]
*  Recognising the urgency, the ICJ has indicated clear provisional measures that must be implemented [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=605.5799999999999s)]
*  now. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqP4zwbZxoU&t=612.06s)]
