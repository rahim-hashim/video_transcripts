# Polio Vaccination success but dire Humanitarian Conditions in Gaza remain - Security Council
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [September 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o)
*  Thank you Mr. President for the opportunity to update the Council alongside Under-Secretary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=0.0s)]
*  General Di Carlo following our briefing last week. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=7.1000000000000005s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Council, the latest developments in Gaza and the West Bank [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=10.9s)]
*  compel us to reaffirm yet again the equal value of every human life. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=17.18s)]
*  The aim of international humanitarian law is to limit the consequences of war by setting [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=25.84s)]
*  minimum standards of conduct to protect and meet the needs of those who are not fighting [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=32.38s)]
*  the basic requirements of humanity. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=40.6s)]
*  Yet suffering and devastation show that there has been almost no limit to the inhumanity [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=44.74s)]
*  unfolding before our eyes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=52.04s)]
*  There are no winners in this war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=55.48s)]
*  Instead it is marked by loss and agony with civilians bearing the heaviest burden. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  As USG Di Carlo has just noted, we see this in the Hamas attacks on October 7 when more [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  than 1,000 people were killed, scores of children included. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=71.52s)]
*  We see this in the recent killings of six hostages. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=77.9s)]
*  Then as USG Di Carlo has said on Estimated 101, Israeli and foreign nationals remain [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=82.36s)]
*  hostage in Gaza, including the remains of those declared dead. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=88.10000000000001s)]
*  We are alarmed by the treatment and conditions of the remaining hostages and the refusal [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=93.56s)]
*  to allow visits or assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cross. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=99.22s)]
*  Mr. President, we also have great concerns about the injury and death toll amongst Palestinians [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=105.48s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=112.48s)]
*  More than 40,000 people killed, 93,000 people injured, over half of them women and children, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=114.16s)]
*  according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=122.96s)]
*  Much of this death and devastation is the result of the use of heavy weapons in densely [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=126.66s)]
*  populated areas, including in camps, shelters, and areas where civilians have been told to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=132.24s)]
*  evacuate. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=139.24s)]
*  Mr. President, members of the Council, the brutality of this conflict seems to know no [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=141.44s)]
*  limits. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=148.36s)]
*  We see this in the many attacks harming humanitarian workers, 295 humanitarian workers killed since [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=150.08s)]
*  October 7. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=159.08s)]
*  We also see this in the attacks on humanitarian assets since January. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=161.3s)]
*  United Nations vehicles have been directly hit in more than a dozen separate incidents, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=165.82000000000002s)]
*  even though their movements were notified. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=172.02s)]
*  Attacks hitting humanitarian personnel and their movement are further limiting the delivery [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  of life-saving humanitarian aid. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=180.54000000000002s)]
*  As noted last week, the World Food Program temporarily suspended staff movements following [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=183.38000000000002s)]
*  an attack that hit one of its convoys on 28 August. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=189.78s)]
*  We see it in the reports of ill treatment, including torture and sexual violence of thousands [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=195.32s)]
*  of Palestinians taken into detention by Israeli forces in Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=202.06s)]
*  We see this in the parties' reported use of human shields and the embedding of military [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=207.56s)]
*  presence in populated areas. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=213.76s)]
*  The medical system in Gaza has been decimated, leaving people, including pregnant and breastfeeding [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  women, small children, without critical care. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=225.28s)]
*  19 of Gaza's 36 hospitals, more than half, are out of service. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  As noted many times before, the remaining hospitals are barely functioning, overwhelmed [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=236.2s)]
*  by patients amid shortages of fuel and medical supplies. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=242.72s)]
*  Water infrastructure has been severely hampered, damaged, reducing the water supply to just [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=249.02s)]
*  a quarter of what it was before October 2023. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=255.4s)]
*  Food sources and production facilities have been destroyed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=260.06s)]
*  Food delivery remains severely hampered by ongoing fighting, damaged roads and barriers [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=264.72s)]
*  to the entry and movement of humanitarian supplies. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=272.64s)]
*  Around 96% of the population continue to face high levels of acute food insecurity, with [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=276.84s)]
*  nearly half a million people facing catastrophic hunger. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=283.68s)]
*  Vital humanitarian operations have been crippled, with growing denials of humanitarian missions [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  and movements within Gaza, which is only causing suffering to compound further. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  At the same time, repeated evacuation orders leave civilians exposed to the dangers of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  hostilities and deprived of the essentials to survive. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=307.08s)]
*  There is no safe place for civilians in Gaza. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=312.32s)]
*  They must be allowed to seek protection. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=316.0s)]
*  Mr. President, it does not have to be this way. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=318.55999999999995s)]
*  Indeed, over the past few days, there have been signs that humanitarian objectives can [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=324.55999999999995s)]
*  inspire positive steps. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=330.16s)]
*  We welcome the local humanitarian forces, which have enabled the launch of the emergency [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=332.96s)]
*  polio vaccination, again, as General Di Carlo highlighted, and recognize the colossal efforts [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=339.16s)]
*  of humanitarian health actors to carry out the campaign in a very challenging environment. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=346.68s)]
*  The senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator met with the highest government [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=353.8s)]
*  levels of the government of Israel yesterday on humanitarian concerns, including the importance [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  of the polio campaign. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=363.12s)]
*  According to World Health Organization, over 187,000 children under the age of 10 have [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=366.44s)]
*  been vaccinated in the first phase of the campaign, towards the goal of reaching more [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=374.0s)]
*  than 640,000 children in the coming period. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=379.16s)]
*  UNRWA is playing a vital role, including with over 200 teams operating in its clinics and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=383.96s)]
*  health points. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=390.88s)]
*  We also welcome the repair of the main water line between Israel and Qanyunis by local [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=392.67999999999995s)]
*  partners in cooperation with UNICEF. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=398.44s)]
*  While the water and sanitation situation in Gaza remains dire, the repair has restored [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=401.4s)]
*  water services in several areas, including Almawasi, where hundreds of thousands of displaced [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=407.08s)]
*  people endure unbearable conditions. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=414.2s)]
*  Despite all the challenges, we remain on the ground in Almawasi and across Gaza, providing [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=417.88s)]
*  essential assistance, including food and shelter, and protection services as best as we can. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=424.24s)]
*  Food rations are being distributed, albeit at reduced levels. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=434.8s)]
*  Due to the lack of supplies, wheat flour is excluded from the ration as it is prioritized [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  for the 14 bakeries supported by humanitarian actors. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=444.3s)]
*  Tens are also being distributed, though they are of course insufficient to match the needs [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=448.92s)]
*  of repeatedly displaced families, especially with the approaching cold and rainy weather. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=453.8s)]
*  Mr. President, distinguished members of the Council, allow me to reiterate our concern [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=462.03999999999996s)]
*  from last week. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=465.56s)]
*  We remain very alarmed by the human toll of intensified Israeli military operations in [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=467.0s)]
*  the West Bank. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=471.84s)]
*  On the night of 27 and 28 August, Israeli forces launched the largest military operation [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=473.5s)]
*  in decades in the northern West Bank, against the backdrop of increased casualties, settler [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  violence, forced displacement and movement restrictions. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=486.91999999999996s)]
*  It's now been a week and that operation is still ongoing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  humanitarian organizations assessed needs in TULCAM and are responding, but were denied [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=497.55999999999995s)]
*  access by Israeli forces for an assessment in Janine. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=503.79999999999995s)]
*  While access denials have limited our ability to fully assess the humanitarian impact, we [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=508.76s)]
*  can confirm that over two dozen Palestinians have been killed over the past week. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=514.52s)]
*  Hundreds of families have been displaced. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=520.64s)]
*  There has been wide-scale damage to basic infrastructure and private property from airstrikes, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=522.76s)]
*  military bulldozers, exchanges of fire and explosive detonations. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=531.24s)]
*  I recall that any use of force in the West Bank must comply with international human [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  rights law and the standards governing law enforcement. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=543.0s)]
*  Tactics typically used during hostilities and armed conflict are inconsistent with these [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=547.72s)]
*  standards and raise concerns of excessive use of force. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=553.32s)]
*  Mr. President, respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law is [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=558.04s)]
*  not optional. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=564.4s)]
*  Allow me to restate that hostages must be released, civilians must be protected and [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=566.72s)]
*  their essential needs must be met. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=572.92s)]
*  This Council and all Member States must use their influence to ensure compliance, including [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=575.76s)]
*  by exerting diplomatic and other pressure and cooperating in pursuing accountability. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=582.88s)]
*  We once again call appeal to Council Members and all Member States to achieve an immediate [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=590.04s)]
*  cessation of hostilities and a sustained ceasefire in Gaza and to de-escalate the situation in [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=595.3s)]
*  the West Bank. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=600.88s)]
*  The actions passed by this Council promised an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=602.88s)]
*  They also called for the release of hostages. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=608.04s)]
*  Yet, months later, the violence continues, thousands more have been killed and hostages [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=610.52s)]
*  remain separated from their families. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=616.96s)]
*  It is time for this Council to turn its promises into reality and end the suffering. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=620.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=625.6s)]
*  I thank Ms. Vassono for her words. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalZRxfVe1o&t=628.4s)]
