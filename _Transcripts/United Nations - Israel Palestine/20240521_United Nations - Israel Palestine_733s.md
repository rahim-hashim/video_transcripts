Video Description: Briefing by Ms. Edem Wosornu, Director of Operations and Advocacy, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.

OCHA’s Director of the Operations and Advocacy Division, Edem Wosornu, told the Council that it was “impossible to accept the people endeavouring to save lives are instead losing their lives, particularly as 1.1 million people face catastrophic levels of hunger, and Gaza remains on the brink of famine.”

As of 18 may, she said, “just 10 bakeries are operational out of a total of 16 being supported by our humanitarian partners and added that “it is expected that these will run out of stock and fuel within days if no additional supplies are received.”

The other six bakeries, she said, “have been forced to cease operation due to either shortages of fuel or because of ongoing hostilities.”

Last week a staff member of the UN Department of Safety and Security from India died and another staff member was injured when their UN vehicle was struck as they travelled to the European Hospital in the area of Rafah. This brings to a total 193 UN staff who have been killed in Gaza since the start of hostilities.

# Gaza Crisis: Lifesavers Losing Lives | OCHA at UN Security Council Briefing
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY)
*  his important briefing. I now give the floor to Ms. Adam Osorno. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you Mr. President, members of the Security Council. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=7.76s)]
*  Thank you for this opportunity to brief you on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  which has only grown from more urgent and made ongoing Israeli ground operations in and around [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=15.6s)]
*  since 6 May. To be frank, we are running out of words to describe what is happening in Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=22.96s)]
*  We have described it as a catastrophe, a nightmare, as hell on earth. It is all of these and worse. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=31.6s)]
*  And living conditions continue to deteriorate as a result of heavy fighting, particularly in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=41.6s)]
*  Jabalaya and eastern Rafah, as well as Israeli bombardment from air, land and sea. The number [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=47.12s)]
*  of casualties continues to increase by the day. According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, more [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=54.08s)]
*  than 35,000 people have now been killed in the violence and more than 79,000 injured. Around 17,000 [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=61.44s)]
*  children are unaccompanied or remain separated from their families. Let me note here also [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=70.16s)]
*  the Israeli military announcement last week that it had recovered the bodies of four Israeli hostages [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=77.28s)]
*  from Gaza. It is estimated that 128 Israeli and foreign nationals remain captive in Gaza, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=83.2s)]
*  including fatalities whose bodies are withheld. And as you know, the extreme levels of violence [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  have not spared the UN and humanitarian community. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=98.16s)]
*  Special coordinator has just updated on the death of our UN colleague on the 13th of May. Yet another [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=104.88s)]
*  UN staff member was killed and another seriously injured when their UN vehicle came under attack [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=113.36s)]
*  while en route to the European Gaza Hospital in Camunis. We lost a father, a husband and a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=120.32s)]
*  dedicated colleague with a distinguished career. This brings the number of UN staff killed in Gaza [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=126.96s)]
*  since the escalation of hostilities, again as has been said, to 193 staff. We find it impossible to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=134.64s)]
*  accept the people endeavoring to save lives are instead losing their lives, particularly as 1.1 [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=142.24s)]
*  million people face catastrophic levels of hunger and Gaza remains on the brink of famine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=149.6s)]
*  As of 18 May, just 10 bakeries are operational out of a total of 16 being supported by our [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=156.24s)]
*  humanitarian partners. However, it is expected that these will run out of stock and fuel within days [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  if no additional supplies are received. The other six bakeries, all of which are in southern Gaza, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=173.52s)]
*  have been forced to cease operation due to either shortages of fuel or because of ongoing hostilities. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=181.12s)]
*  The healthcare system in Gaza is also under impossible strain. In Rafa, 21 medical points, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=190.56s)]
*  four primary health care centers and four hospitals are now inaccessible. In the north, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=198.0s)]
*  two hospitals, five primary health care centers and 16 medical points are inaccessible. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=205.76s)]
*  These facilities all provided critical medical services including trauma care, non-communicable [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=213.92s)]
*  disease management, kidney dialysis and maternal and child health care. An estimated 14,000 critical [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=220.16s)]
*  patients currently require medical evacuation out of Gaza. Prior to the closure of the Rafa [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=228.72s)]
*  crossing, medical evacuations had reached approximately 50 patients per day. This means [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=235.6s)]
*  nearly 700 patients have not been evacuated since the closure of the Rafa crossing. Mr. President, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=242.4s)]
*  since October 2023, 75% of the population in Gaza, 1.7 million people have been forcibly [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=249.92s)]
*  displaced within Gaza, many of them up to four or five times including as a result of repeated [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=260.08s)]
*  IDF-issued evacuation instructions. Some reports have also suggested that many thousands of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=266.96s)]
*  Razaans may have crossed into Egypt and more are trying. In the past two weeks, more than 800,000 [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=273.92s)]
*  people have been displaced from Rafa into other parts, other areas of Gaza in search of safety. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=282.48s)]
*  As the conflict persists and lives are threatened, civilians must be allowed to seek protection. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  I must also emphasize unequivocally that persons forcibly displaced within or from Gaza [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=296.8s)]
*  must be guaranteed the right to voluntarily return as international law demands. Mr. President, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=304.72s)]
*  distinguished members of the Security Council, today the once overcrowded camps and emergency [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=312.8s)]
*  shelters in Rafa have now largely emptied with the majority of the displaced seeking refuge in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=319.36s)]
*  Hanunis and their Aballa. But the situation that people are finding on the arrival at new sites [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=327.2s)]
*  in these areas is horrendous. There is exceedingly limited existing infrastructure. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=334.56s)]
*  They lack adequate latrines, water points, drainage and shelter. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=342.64s)]
*  Civilians' essential needs must be met. For evacuated civilians, this means ensuring to the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=348.4s)]
*  greater, greatest practicable extent, proper shelter and satisfactory minimum conditions of hygiene, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=356.32s)]
*  health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=366.88s)]
*  These appalling conditions leave serious doubt as to compliance with these basic obligations. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  Mr. President, the Rafa ground incursion is magnifying the impediments to an already fragile [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=381.36s)]
*  and beleaguered aid operation, as again has been said. As of 17 May, the Rafa ground [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  remains closed and inaccessible for humanity and cargo, fuel and personnel movement. This has [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=396.56s)]
*  prevented the entry of 82,000 metric tons of supplies, including critical food items and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=403.52s)]
*  medicines. Around 654,000 litres of fuel have entered the strip since the Rafa operation begun [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=410.96s)]
*  on the 6th of May. This means on average we are receiving just one quarter of the fuel [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=420.48s)]
*  allocations that we had prior to 6th of May, further impacting the functioning of bakeries, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=428.56s)]
*  hospitals, water wells and other critical infrastructure. The crossing at Karam Shalom, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=435.04s)]
*  which has been the main entry point for critical aid, remains open in principle, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=441.6s)]
*  but extremely difficult for aid organisations to access from the Raza side due to hostilities, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  challenging logistical conditions and complex coordination procedures. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=452.8s)]
*  Among the northern Raza route, sorry, the northern land routes, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=459.44s)]
*  Eres crossing opened from 1st to 9th May has been closed since. The newly opened Eres West, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=463.2s)]
*  known as Siafa or Zikim, is now being used for limited quantities of aid, but now areas [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=472.0s)]
*  in the vicinity of this crossing are also under evacuation orders. We welcome the first aid [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=482.24s)]
*  shipment delivered on 17 May via the floating dock set up by the United States. The maritime corridor [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=488.88s)]
*  hosted by Cyprus in line with Resolution 2720 and with support from other member states is an [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=495.84s)]
*  important adjunct to a comprehensive humanitarian operation in the Raza. But as we have stressed, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=502.88s)]
*  land routes remain the most viable and effective way to deliver the scale of aid needed. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=510.23999999999995s)]
*  Mr. President, the United Nations and our partners are committed to staying and delivering in the Raza. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=518.16s)]
*  Wherever civilians are in need and we are configuring our operations to recent population [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=525.84s)]
*  movements. The United Nations Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinators are active in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  active engagement with relative parties to accelerate the provision of humanitarian relief [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=538.48s)]
*  consignments to Raza through all possible routes. However, due to the current closure of the Rafa [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=544.08s)]
*  crossing and limited access via Karim Shalom and other crossings, right now we lack [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=550.8s)]
*  the supplies and fuel to provide any meaningful level of support. I can take you and the council [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=558.56s)]
*  members through the list of things we need. You have heard them before. One, the death, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=565.28s)]
*  the toll of death, injury, destruction in Raza is utterly unconscionable. We demand the civilians, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=573.76s)]
*  their housing and the vital infrastructure they depend on be protected as international [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=582.64s)]
*  humanitarian law requires. All feasible precautions must be taken to avoid and minimize civilian harm. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=588.8s)]
*  Two, we need the facilitation of rapid and impeded passage of humanitarian relief into [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=596.56s)]
*  and within Raza also as a matter of international humanitarian law. All available access points must [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=602.4s)]
*  be open and kept open for a sustained period to allow aid to enter at scale. Three, we also need [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=609.52s)]
*  to be assured of the protection of humanitarian and UN staff, all of whom are working under extreme [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=619.76s)]
*  conditions in Raza. This requires the parties to take constant care throughout military operations. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=625.28s)]
*  The agreed humanitarian notification system aims to maximize. It also requires enabling a stable [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=632.56s)]
*  communications network. Four, we need adequate funding, particularly for UNRWA, the United [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=641.68s)]
*  Nations Relief and Works Agency, which is the central pillar of our aid operation. As of 20 May, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=649.28s)]
*  the 2024 flash appeal is only 25% funded. We urge donors to step forward with the funding [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=656.96s)]
*  received. We are grateful for the funding already received. But in all honesty, Mr. President, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=665.84s)]
*  members of the council, at this stage and as has been said, it is only a humanitarian ceasefire [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  and a halt in the ground incursion in Rafa that will fully protect civilians, create the conditions [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=678.5600000000001s)]
*  for humanitarians to work, to provide assistance at the scale required and stem the endlessly [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=685.28s)]
*  deepening toll of this travesty in Raza. So our principal call today is for all parties [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=693.36s)]
*  as a matter of urgency to make genuine progress towards ceasefire, for the release of all remaining [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=700.72s)]
*  hostages and for the Security Council and all member states to use their influence to bring [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=707.92s)]
*  this humanitarian catastrophe to an end. Thank you. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBZSFduDtpY&t=714.32s)]
