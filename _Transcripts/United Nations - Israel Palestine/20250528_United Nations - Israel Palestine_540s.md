# Israel on the attack in DC & latest developments in the region - Security Council Media Stakeout
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0)
*  Good morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=2.92s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Dunon, will deliver a brief statement about last [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  week's horrific terror attack in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=8.6s)]
*  He will also comment on the latest developments in the region and will take your questions. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=11.72s)]
*  If you do have a question, please remember to state your name and outlet. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=15.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=20.16s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=24.44s)]
*  Last week, two young people on the diplomatic staff at Israel's Embassy in Washington, D.C., [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Yaron Elishinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgram, were murdered on the street as they were leaving [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=31.840000000000003s)]
*  the Capitol Jewish Museum. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=38.08s)]
*  There were a couple Yaron was planning to propose this week in Jerusalem. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=40.6s)]
*  They were gunned down in cold blood by a terrorist screaming, Free Palestine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=46.72s)]
*  This was an act of anti-Semitic terrorism. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=52.2s)]
*  However, the gunman was the last link in a much longer chain, one that stretches from [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=55.2s)]
*  hate-filled protests on social media lies and to the halls of the United Nations. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=62.56s)]
*  When UN officials like Mr. Tom Fletcher accuse Israel of genocide, when they irresponsibly [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=70.8s)]
*  claim that, and I quote it now, 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours, they are not [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  engaging in advocacy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  They are engaging in incitement. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=89.16s)]
*  That claim was a lie. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=91.96s)]
*  Mr. Fletcher quietly retracted it, but the damage was already done. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=93.88s)]
*  It is no coincidence that this statement was made just two days before Yaron and Sarah [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  were murdered. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=105.96s)]
*  We cannot ignore the role that reckless remarks play in fueling violence. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=107.48s)]
*  Mr. Fletcher and others like him must be held accountable. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=112.28s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel continues to act with restraint and responsibility, even in the face of lies. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=116.76s)]
*  We are facilitating humanitarian aid into Gaza through two mechanisms, the existing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  crossings and a new system created in coordination with the U.S. and international partners. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=130.76s)]
*  Since May 19, almost 9,000 tons of aid have entered Gaza carrying food, medical supplies, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=138.28s)]
*  and shelter equipment. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=146.28s)]
*  In the past two weeks, four new aid distribution centers were established inside Gaza. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=148.2s)]
*  Two of them are already open. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=153.64s)]
*  These two centers distribute food packages to thousands of families, despite Hamas establishing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=159.0s)]
*  roadblocks and checkpoints to prevent civilians from reaching the aid. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=166.12s)]
*  As we speak, there are more than 400 trucks already on the Gaza side of the fence waiting [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=170.92s)]
*  to be distributed, but the U.N. has failed to pick them up. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=179.08s)]
*  We opened the crossings, we provided safe routes for those trucks, but the U.N. did [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=184.52s)]
*  not show up. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=190.6s)]
*  So let me be clear, the U.N. must stop spreading panic and start moving aid. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  Put your ego aside, pick up the aid, and do your job. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=199.16s)]
*  Finally, as negotiations for the release of the hostages continue, the facts remain. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=204.28s)]
*  Israel accepted the most recent deal, Hamas rejected it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=210.84s)]
*  We will not stop defending our people, we will not abandon our hostages who have been [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  held for 600 days now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=219.88s)]
*  We will not apologize for fighting back against terror. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=223.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=228.36s)]
*  Ambassador, hi, thank you very much. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=229.72s)]
*  Yvonne Mariotti, E! News. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=233.32s)]
*  You're losing, Israel's losing support amongst European allies. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  Your own former Prime Minister has accused Israel of carrying out war crimes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=238.76s)]
*  There are hostage families protesting on the streets of Tel Aviv. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=242.84s)]
*  Are you feeling the pressure now to stop bombing the people of Gaza? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  We are not bombing the people of Gaza, we are fighting a terrorist organization. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  And as I said very clearly, we have two goals in this war. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=253.32s)]
*  We haven't finished the job. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=256.76s)]
*  We will not finish the war leaving behind 58 people. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=258.12s)]
*  There are families waiting for them, and we are committed to finish this war by making [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=261.56s)]
*  sure the hostages are back and Hamas is out of the game. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=266.44s)]
*  Ambassador, good afternoon with China Central Television. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=270.04s)]
*  My question is on West Bank. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=272.92s)]
*  You said many times here that Israel is the state of democracy and rule of law. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=274.92s)]
*  And this is what exactly happened with our Chinese colleague in West Bank last weekend [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=280.12s)]
*  during the what many people call Jerusalem Day. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=285.24s)]
*  His equipment has been damaged and he has been verbally discriminatively abused. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=287.56s)]
*  Can you explain a little bit what kind of rule of law is this, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=294.84s)]
*  especially the law enforcement when they saw those kind of things they left? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=298.2s)]
*  So I cannot relate to what you are showing me, but I would appreciate if you send me [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=302.68s)]
*  the information and we were going to look into this incident. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=307.4s)]
*  But we are a democracy and we are proud of it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=310.52s)]
*  So there is freedom for journalists in Israel and we have seen it all over the years. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=316.44s)]
*  If there was an incident, we will look into that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=323.48s)]
*  First let me make it clear, we don't run those centers. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=343.0s)]
*  We provide security for the surrounding area. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=346.36s)]
*  As for yesterday, it was the first day. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=349.48s)]
*  There were a few riots. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=352.12s)]
*  It took the American team some time to take control of the situation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=353.56s)]
*  But I can say it out loud, we didn't shoot anyone over there. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  There were reports about helicopters shooting people and those kind of things. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=361.56s)]
*  It didn't happen. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=366.12s)]
*  No, not by us. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=368.68s)]
*  Not by us. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=369.48s)]
*  I will listen to his words. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=399.72s)]
*  I think it is important to bring briefers from both sides. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=407.64000000000004s)]
*  We have asked that there will be briefers that will speak about our suffering. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  Unfortunately, it will not happen today. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=415.16s)]
*  I hope it will be more balanced in the future meetings. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  But I agree with you, there is suffering in Gaza. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  But the blame is on the shoulders of Hamas. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=423.56s)]
*  Hamas that started the war and Hamas that is not willing to lay down their weapons and release hostages. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=426.12s)]
*  So they will continue to be suffering until Hamas will understand that they will not stay in Gaza. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=432.12s)]
*  So at this stage, we have both tracks. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  I call it the old one, which is the tracks. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=453.8s)]
*  And the UN should move faster and be more helpful on this issue. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=456.76s)]
*  They complain a lot and they should be more cooperative. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=460.84s)]
*  And at the same time, I would call it the US centers. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=464.04s)]
*  But I think that probably some people look at it as a competition. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=468.44s)]
*  And I think it shouldn't be the case. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=472.2s)]
*  I think the UN should put their ego aside and cooperate with the new mechanism as well. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=473.48s)]
*  So I think he is responsible for inflaming the situation and I will elaborate on that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=483.72s)]
*  First, he came to the Security Council and used the term genocide. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=493.24s)]
*  That was irresponsible. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=497.08s)]
*  That was not his role. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=499.08s)]
*  No legal claim for that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=500.36s)]
*  Then he continued and blame us for killing 14,000 Palestinian babies, which was a lie. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=502.04s)]
*  It didn't happen. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=507.72s)]
*  And only two days ago, he put out another provocation saying that there are 10,000 tracks [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=509.4s)]
*  waiting to enter Gaza. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=514.68s)]
*  That's another provocation. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=516.2s)]
*  You know, if you line up 10,000 tracks from the border with Gaza, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=517.4s)]
*  it will actually be a line until the border with Lebanon. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=522.68s)]
*  From where he's bringing those numbers, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=526.52s)]
*  he should be more responsible when he puts out those statements. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=528.2s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=531.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AJvDlnqCX0&t=538.44s)]
