Video Description: Former Israeli hostage Eli Sharabi today (20 Mar) told the Security Council that his captors in Gaza “would eat many meals a day from the UN aid in front of us, and we never received any of it,” and said, “Hamas eats like kings while hostages starve.”

Briefing the Council on the humanitarian conditions of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East, Khaled Khiari, said, “the ceasefire and hostages release deal that took effect on 19th January offered a glimmer of hope and respite by reuniting 25 Israeli hostages with their loved ones and returning the remains of eight deceased hostages who were killed on 7th October or while in captivity to their families.”

Nevertheless, Khiari said, “their release and return were sadly also a moment of great anxiety, as most of the leaving hostages were paraded in front of crowds and the coffins of the deceased, including those of two young children who were killed in captivity, where displaced publicly by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups during appalling ceremonies that violated international law.”

He stressed that “the hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally,” and “until their release, they must be allowed to receive visits and support from the International Committee of the Red Cross, and they must be treated with dignity and respect, in line with humanitarian principles.”

The Assistant Secretary-General said, “the resumed hostilities in Gaza, compounded with a lack of access and the rapidity deteriorating humanitarian situation, are exposing the remaining hostages to constant danger and life threatening conditions.”

Sharabi, who was held for 491 days, told the Council that while in captivity he “imagined the life we would rebuild” and “dreamt of seeing my family again.”

Only after he was released, he said, “learned the truth, my wife and my daughters had been slaughtered by Hamas terrorists on October 7th.”

Sharabi said, “I cannot begin to describe the agony. It was hell. I was fed a piece of pita a day. Maybe a sip of tea. Hunger consumed everything. They beat me. They broke my ribs. I didn't care. I just wanted a piece of bread.”

Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour expressed his condolences to the former hostage, and said, “entire families obliterated in massive and indiscriminate bombardments. Children shot by Israeli snipers in the head and in the chest. Communities uprooted by force. There is not a single Palestinian family that does not have a loved one killed, wounded, detained or displaced.”

Mansour said, “Israel arrests our children, our doctors, our teachers, our workers, family members, bystanders, parliamentarians, academics, human rights defenders. Israel considers all Palestinians guilty, all Palestinians guilty.”

For his part, Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon said, “for 530 days, you have erased the hostages. You have spoken about Gaza without mentioning the crimes of Hamas. You have debated humanitarian assistance without acknowledging the humanitarian crimes Hamas is deliberately inflicting on the hostages. You have the audacity to talk about a ceasefire without demanding that those held in Hamas' terror tunnels be freed. How can you claim to stand for international law while ignoring the hostages? You have audacity to talk about a ceasefire without demanding that those held in Hamas's tunnels be freed? How can you claim to stand for international law while ignoring the hostages?”

Danon said, “there are so many on this Council, you, who never fail to scream for more aid, more trucks, more shipments, more access. Yet you have never once demanded that a single piece of that aid be delivered to our hostages.”

*  groups in Israel on 7 October 2023. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  The United Nations continued to unequivocally condemn the appalling acts of terror that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=60.28s)]
*  took place on 7 October and continued holding of hostages in Gaza. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=65.76s)]
*  Nothing can justify the intentional killing, torture, sexual violence and destruction entire [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=71.68s)]
*  families murdered, burned in their homes, taken hostage. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=77.36s)]
*  The events of that horrific day will not be forgotten. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  The participation in Security Council meeting of surviving hostages and their heart-wrenching [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=85.48s)]
*  testimonies and many months of agony serve as a stark reminder, but also as a crucial [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=90.88s)]
*  symbol of endurance and hope for those still waiting to see their loved ones back home. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=99.04s)]

*  with the families of hostages and have been deeply moved by their stories and by the torment [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=112.8s)]
*  and anguish they have endured. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=118.72s)]
*  Madam President, the ceasefire and hostages release deal that took effect on 19 January [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=122.4s)]
*  offered a glimmer of hope and respite by reuniting 25 Israeli hostages with their loved ones [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=129.6s)]

*  in captivity to their families. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=142.76s)]
*  Their release and return were sadly also a moment of great anxiety as most of the living [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=147.04s)]
*  hostages were paraded in front of groves and the coffins of the deceased, including those [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=153.32s)]
*  of two young children who were killed in captivity, were displayed publicly by Hamas and other [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  Palestinian armed groups during appalling ceremonies that violated international law. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=165.88s)]
*  The United Nations has repeatedly condemned the parading of coffins containing the bodies [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  of dead Israeli hostages and public displays accompanying the release of living and deceased [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  hostages, including statements made under duress. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  As of today, at least 59 hostages alive and deceased, including Eli's brother, Yossi [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=190.24s)]
*  Sharabi, are still being held captive by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. The testimonies [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=198.0s)]
*  of those released provide terrifying accounts of their captivity, including physical and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  psychological torture, sexual violence and deprivation, indicating that those left behind [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=210.3s)]
*  continue to suffer in horrific conditions, exposed to trauma and suffering since their [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=216.88s)]
*  abduction. The hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally. Until they release, they [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=222.12s)]
*  must be allowed to receive visits and support from the International Committee of the Red [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  Cross and they must be treated with dignity and respect in line with humanitarian principles. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  Madam President, the resumption of hostilities on 18th of March adds further despair and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=242.92s)]
*  uncertainty for those remaining hostages, their families and their loved ones. This [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=250.32s)]
*  resumption of hostilities amidst significant Israeli strikes in Gaza has also been devastating [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=257.08s)]
*  for the civilian population in the street. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  including women and children. Since the resumption of hostilities, one United Nations Office [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=270.08s)]
*  for Project Services, UNOPS staff member, has also been killed and several have been [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  injured. Commissioner General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, Lazzarini, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=282.2s)]
*  also informed that in the past few days, another five UNRWA staff have been confirmed killed. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=287.84s)]
*  I reiterate that civilians must be protected, including personnel. The rights and dignity [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=295.23999999999995s)]
*  of all those affected by the conflict, whether in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=301.73999999999995s)]
*  or elsewhere, must be respected and protected. We call on all parties to uphold their obligations [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=307.82s)]
*  under international humanitarian law and international human rights law. The return to hostilities [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=315.82s)]
*  threatens all civilians in Gaza. I echo the Secretary General's call for the resumption [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=322.08s)]
*  of serious negotiations for the ceasefire to be respected, for unimpeded humanitarian [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=327.28s)]
*  assistance to be reestablished and for the remaining hostages to be released immediately [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=332.88s)]
*  and unconditionally. With every passing day, we move further away from the objective of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=338.2s)]
*  returning the remaining hostages safely to their homes. This was also very clear from [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=343.88s)]
*  the rescued hostages, Ms. Noah Argamini's remarks to the Council last month, where she [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=349.72s)]
*  told us that every moment under captivity was lived in danger. The resumed hostilities [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=357.12s)]
*  in Gaza, compounded with a lack of access and rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=363.44000000000005s)]
*  are exposing the remaining hostages to constant danger and life-threatening conditions. As [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=370.44000000000005s)]
*  Under Secretary General Fletcher briefed you earlier this week, a renewed ceasefire is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=377.04s)]
*  the best way of protecting civilians in Gaza, in the occupied Palestinian territory and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=381.76s)]
*  in Israel, releasing hostages and detainees and allowing aid and commercial supplies in. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  We remain steadfast in our commitment to protecting human rights, defending humanitarian principles [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=394.92s)]
*  and supporting all efforts that promote peace, stability, and a more hopeful future for all. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=400.36s)]
*  We are also convinced that the only path to durable peace will be achieved when Israel [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=406.48s)]
*  and Palestine live side by side in peace and security, in line with international law and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=413.76s)]
*  relevant UN resolutions with Jerusalem as the capital of both states. The United Nations [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=419.16s)]
*  stands ready to do all it can to support the parties in reaching that objective, and it [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  will continue to do all it can to support an end to this suffering. Once again, I reiterate [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=431.16s)]
*  the Secretary General's deep concern for this conflict's unbearable impact on the victims [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=438.8s)]
*  and his urgent call for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUGJy0D7khM&t=445.04s)]
