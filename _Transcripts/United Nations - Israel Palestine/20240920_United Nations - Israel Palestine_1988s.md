Video Description: Briefing UN Security Council members today (19 Sep) on the situation in the Middle East, Tor Wennesland, UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process expressed his “grave concern” on the "the series of explosions across Lebanon and rockets fired toward Israel in recent days," warning that these incidents add to the overall volatility. Wennesland urged all parties to "refrain from steps that will further exacerbate the situation and take immediate steps to deescalate."

In his briefing, Wennesland also highlighted the ongoing demolitions and seizures of Palestinian-owned structures in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. He noted that over 550 people, including 250 children, had been displaced. He said, “demolitions and seizures of Palestinian-owned structures continued... citing the lack of Israeli-issued building permits, which are almost impossible for Palestinians to obtain.”

The Special Coordinator also expressed alarm over provocative actions and rhetoric on both sides. Urging all parties to reject such dangerous incitements, he said, “a joint statement from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad threatened a return to the use of suicide bombings... while an Israeli minister said, ‘Palestinian prisoners must be killed. Shot in the head.’”

Helen Clark, a member of The Elders and former Prime Minister of New Zealand, told the Security Council that the current approach to managing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has failed. She criticized member states that use their veto power to "protect allies" or "obstruct geopolitical rivals," warning that this undermines the authority of the Council.

Riyad H. Mansour, Permanent Observer of Palestine to the UN, referred to a recent advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice, declaring Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as unlawful. “The Court reaffirmed the illegality of Israel’s settlements... stressing the obligations of the occupying Power to cease immediately all settlement activities,” Mansour said.

Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon said, “this Council and the world must wake up to the reality of the threat Iran poses. The dark force driving the violence we see today is not a collection of independent groups; it is Iran pulling the strings," He said, “the Iranian proxies, Hezbollah in the North, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria and terrorist cells in Judea and Samaria, are all Iran's attack dogs unleashed to spread death and destruction across the region.” Danon further said that Iran is not only targeting Israel but is seeking domination of the entire Middle East, while the Palestinian Authority is being “utterly weak and impotent.”
