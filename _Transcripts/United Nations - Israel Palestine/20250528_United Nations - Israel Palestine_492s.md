# Palestine/Israel: 'Two-State Solution is on life support'- UN Special Coordinator Media Stakeout
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Sigrid Kak. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=0.0s)]
*  Hello, good morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=5.0s)]
*  It's been an open session. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=7.0s)]
*  You've heard the council, you've heard myself, you've heard the briefer, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=9.0s)]
*  and I think we're at a very difficult moment. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=14.0s)]
*  You've heard me say the two-state solutions on life support [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=18.0s)]
*  and with a very strong push for member states to have courage, conviction, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=22.0s)]
*  and for peace to really win over politics. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=26.0s)]
*  We have no other message. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=30.0s)]
*  Situation in Gaza, of course, we discussed extensively. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=32.0s)]
*  You've heard me speak. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=35.0s)]
*  I don't want to waste words amidst such suffering. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=37.0s)]
*  Edie. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=41.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, Ms. Kak. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=44.0s)]
*  A couple of questions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=47.0s)]
*  First, could you answer what the Israeli ambassador said [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=49.0s)]
*  about 400 trucks being on the Kerim Shalom side [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=56.0s)]
*  and not actually moving or getting to warehouses and to people in need? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=63.0s)]
*  I know you said that it's like a lifeboat after the ship has sunk. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=71.0s)]
*  Secondly, does the UN have any information on the number of people injured [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=79.0s)]
*  and killed at the aid distribution yesterday by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=90.0s)]
*  I think I need to answer your two questions, sadly fairly generically, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=100.0s)]
*  because it's very dangerous to say, what about this instance? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=105.0s)]
*  I'm in New York now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=109.0s)]
*  My colleagues are working on the ground. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=110.0s)]
*  They may have the latest. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=112.0s)]
*  And the humanitarian team is issuing a statement. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=113.0s)]
*  When it comes more generally to the UN's ability to collect [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=116.0s)]
*  and then distribute what is on or in the trucks, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=120.0s)]
*  that has been subjected to a number of new measures or restrictions [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=125.0s)]
*  and has only hampered our very limited ability to operate in what is an active war zone, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=129.0s)]
*  including also, of course, the humanitarian zone. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=135.0s)]
*  The rules have changed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=138.0s)]
*  The drivers were vetted. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=139.0s)]
*  Then there were other measures introduced. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=141.0s)]
*  So it's not as simple and not as black and white. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=143.0s)]
*  They're there, and the UN isn't coming. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=145.0s)]
*  It is intrinsically more complicated. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=148.0s)]
*  So I don't want to go into 400 trucks or 9,000 or the volume of 9,000. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=151.0s)]
*  I think the biggest message is aid needs to be allowed in, sustained in the volume that is needed [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=156.0s)]
*  to reach all people and allow the UN and the humanitarian partners to do their job [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=163.0s)]
*  the way they've always done and the way they do it wherever else in the world [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=167.0s)]
*  in times of conflict in accordance with international humanitarian law. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=172.0s)]
*  We shouldn't get stuck on side roads. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=176.0s)]
*  The high road is, does the aid reach people? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=179.0s)]
*  Is it sustained and is it the right volume in accordance with their very broad needs [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=182.0s)]
*  because people in Gaza need everything? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=187.0s)]
*  It's no coincidence that I said people do not say anymore, I'll see you tomorrow. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=189.0s)]
*  I'll see you in heaven. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=196.0s)]
*  There's a lot of sadness and weight behind that expression. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=198.0s)]
*  It says it all. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=202.0s)]
*  I was going to ask, Michelle Nicholson-Royders, the Israeli ambassador said the two mechanisms [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=203.0s)]
*  would continue operating for the moment. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=209.0s)]
*  Is Israel indicated at all to the UN as to whether the UN might get cut off [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=211.0s)]
*  and the only option is to go through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=217.0s)]
*  And Steve Glickoff has said, just said in the Oval Office, that they've got a new term sheet. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=223.0s)]
*  They're hoping the president will sign up on it for a ceasefire push. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=229.0s)]
*  Are you aware of what might be in this? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=233.0s)]
*  Have you spoken with Mr. Glickoff? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=235.0s)]
*  Do you share his optimism that this could be a resolution? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=237.0s)]
*  I think I learned one ground rule in Dutch politics. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=240.0s)]
*  I don't comment on the comments by others and I haven't been in the room. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=242.0s)]
*  So I'm not going to do that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=246.0s)]
*  We'll need to wait to be informed. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=247.0s)]
*  Our focus at the moment, of course, is on the assistance getting in. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=249.0s)]
*  We're not negotiating. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=253.0s)]
*  We obviously keep pushing for an immediate ceasefire and the unconditional release [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=255.0s)]
*  of the hostages as well as the return of the remains. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=260.0s)]
*  But the negotiators are dealing with this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=264.0s)]
*  When it comes to how long can the UN, will the UN or partners be allowed to function, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=267.0s)]
*  first of all we were told as of May 24th, May 25th, the Foundation would take over. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=272.0s)]
*  We've seen that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=278.0s)]
*  Now there's a space, it seems, where we are working in parallel. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=279.0s)]
*  There's no cutoff date. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=283.0s)]
*  The point is we need to reach out to people in Gaza. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=284.0s)]
*  They shouldn't be displaced again and again just to receive aid. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=287.0s)]
*  And it needs to be done on a daily basis in a manner that is incumbent [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=291.0s)]
*  and aligned with international humanitarian law. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=294.0s)]
*  I'm not going to speculate about the rest. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=296.0s)]
*  The UN's plan is very clear and we continue to ask support for our way of working. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=298.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=303.0s)]
*  Question from the audience. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=305.0s)]
*  Well, I think our appeal is not different from party A to party B. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=330.0s)]
*  I think the line when it comes to realization of rights, safety and security of Israel, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=333.0s)]
*  the need for a two-state solution, not now, not next week. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=338.0s)]
*  It should have been achieved a long time ago. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=343.0s)]
*  Those are, I think, principled positions by the UN. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=346.0s)]
*  We're willing to facilitate, willing to help. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=349.0s)]
*  We're on the ground. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=351.0s)]
*  That doesn't differ. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=353.0s)]
*  Earlier I've had a number of contacts with the new officials of the new US administration, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=354.0s)]
*  but we know there is a different way of working. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=360.0s)]
*  And we're very frequently in touch with the negotiators, particularly Egypt and Qatar. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=363.0s)]
*  But ultimately, international consensus and legitimacy rests with the resolutions and the council. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=368.0s)]
*  And I think it's very fair that a number of council members and myself referred with great [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=375.0s)]
*  emphasis to the two-state conference hosted, co-chaired rather, by France and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=380.0s)]
*  because it's a critical moment in time. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=388.0s)]
*  It was no coincidence that I said the two-state solutions on life support and all measures that are [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=390.0s)]
*  taken and continue to be taken, settlements, violence, housing demolitions, all risk creating a very [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=395.0s)]
*  irreversible situation that the two-state solution is no longer truly something that you can realize. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=403.0s)]
*  Salman Mansour's famous artwork of 1996 actually points to that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=413.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=418.0s)]
*  I think it's the last question. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=420.0s)]
*  I have to catch a plane, as always. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=421.0s)]
*  How concerned are you that US mercenaries are now operating inside Gaza, some of them linked to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=423.0s)]
*  that notorious firm, Blackwater? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=434.0s)]
*  How concerning is that for you? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=437.0s)]
*  Are you going to speak out against it? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=439.0s)]
*  Well, I think the UN has spoken very clearly as to what we consider alignment and compliance with [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=441.0s)]
*  international law. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=447.0s)]
*  That speaks to our plan. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=448.0s)]
*  I think the privatization of aid and the weaponization of aid is a very dangerous precedent. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=450.0s)]
*  It doesn't only speak to the situation potentially in Gaza, but worldwide. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=457.0s)]
*  And we have to look at the things we allow, don't allow, or speak out against or discourage. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=462.0s)]
*  It's not only relevant to the here and the now, it is relevant to so many other conflict situations. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=469.0s)]
*  So I would say support the UN. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=475.0s)]
*  I'm not going to speculate about everything else. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=479.0s)]
*  I haven't seen, but it's pretty clear. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=481.0s)]
*  Let's say the experiences of the past speak for themselves. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=483.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=486.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viR_-O3tnSA&t=487.0s)]
