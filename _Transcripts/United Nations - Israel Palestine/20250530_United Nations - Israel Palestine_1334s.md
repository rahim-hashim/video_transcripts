# The Arab Group on Palestine - Security Council Media Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU)
*  Good morning everyone and thank you for being here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=0.0s)]
*  As chair of the Arab Group for the month of May, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=3.0s)]
*  I'll make a few opening remarks and then hand over [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=6.3s)]
*  to the representative of Palestine, Ambassador Majed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=10.36s)]
*  Bamye. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=13.8s)]
*  Following Wednesday's Security Council briefing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=16.2s)]
*  on the situation in the Middle East, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=18.52s)]
*  the Arab Group stands united in our determination [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=20.84s)]
*  to mobilize and put an end to the catastrophic war on Gaza. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=24.36s)]
*  The Arab Group calls on the Security Council to take [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=29.88s)]
*  immediate action to bring an end to this horrific war [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=33.28s)]
*  and Israel's inhumane blockade on the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=38.34s)]
*  Most urgently, we demand the lifting of all restrictions [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=43.58s)]
*  on humanitarian aid and its distribution based [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=47.36s)]
*  on humanitarian principles. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  The Council cannot stand by as starvation is used [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  as a weapon of war. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=57.16s)]
*  The Arab Group categorically rejects Israel's proposed aid [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=59.7s)]
*  mechanism, which violates basic humanitarian principles [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  and international law. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=67.94s)]
*  At the same time, we reiterate our longstanding demand [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=70.3s)]
*  for an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=73.78s)]
*  and the immediate and unconditional release [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=78.86s)]
*  of all hostages and the release of detainees. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=81.30000000000001s)]
*  The Council must shoulder its responsibility [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=86.66s)]
*  and take decisive action to this end, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=89.94s)]
*  including by adopting the draft resolution on Gaza [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=93.24s)]
*  that is currently being advanced by the E-10. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=96.7s)]
*  As we look toward the upcoming conference on the two-state [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=100.78s)]
*  solution, co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=103.58s)]
*  it is critical that member states take concrete actions [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=108.06s)]
*  to advance sustainable peace. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=111.69999999999999s)]
*  We salute those countries that have recognized the state [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=115.3s)]
*  of Palestine and strongly encourage others [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=117.84s)]
*  to follow their example. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  Recognition is not just a symbolic gesture. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=123.74s)]
*  It is a concrete step towards a just and lasting peace. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=127.52s)]
*  The time for half measures has passed. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=133.42s)]
*  The Security Council must fulfill its responsibility [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=136.22s)]
*  to maintain international peace and security [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=139.76s)]
*  and to protect civilians. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=143.6s)]
*  Palestinian lives are not less valuable than any other lives, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=146.4s)]
*  and the Council must act accordingly. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=150.86s)]
*  I now turn to Ambassador Majed Bamia [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  of the State of Palestine. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=157.04s)]
*  Ambassador Bamia Thank you, Mr. Chair. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=160.44s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=161.32s)]
*  And allow me at the outset to thank the Arab group [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=162.28s)]
*  for their relentless efforts over the last 20 months. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=165.12s)]
*  I think at this point, the situation does not mean [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=169.88s)]
*  we need more description. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=172.36s)]
*  It's enough to say Gaza for everybody to understand [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=174.56s)]
*  the human tragedy unfolding before our eyes, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=177.06s)]
*  the constant bombardments against the population [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=180.56s)]
*  who has nowhere to flee, the dispersion, the displacement, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=183.4s)]
*  the killing, the starvation, and the killing of children, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  and the starving of children. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=194.62s)]
*  So we need to know what we are talking about. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=196.62s)]
*  There is international outrage, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=199.62s)]
*  but our outrage is not good enough. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=203.12s)]
*  It's not good enough for the people of Gaza [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=205.52s)]
*  to know that the world condemns Israel's action, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=207.16s)]
*  condemns these crimes, stands against them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=210.32s)]
*  We need actions. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=212.82s)]
*  This is the responsibility of the Security Council, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=215.0s)]
*  and we call on the Security Council to act as an Arab group, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=217.66s)]
*  but this is also the responsibility [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=221.4s)]
*  of the other bodies of the United Nations. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=222.88s)]
*  It's the responsibility also of the General Assembly, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=224.78s)]
*  and it's the responsibility of all states [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  to take the requisite actions, decisive actions, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=230.44s)]
*  that deter Israel from continuing on this course. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=233.78s)]
*  Our demands are clear. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=238.34s)]
*  They are simple. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=240.12s)]
*  They are aligned with international law, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=241.26000000000002s)]
*  and honestly, with the bare minimum of human decency. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=243.32s)]
*  We demand an immediate ceasefire, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=247.5s)]
*  and here allow me to commend Egypt and Qatar, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  who are standing beside us for all the efforts [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=252.06s)]
*  they have done in coordination with the U.S. administration [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=254.24s)]
*  in trying to secure such a ceasefire, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  and we want to see in that context the implementation, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=260.0s)]
*  the full implementation of Resolution 2735 [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=262.26s)]
*  of this very Council, which foresees an end [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=265.9s)]
*  to the bloodshed, release of hostages and prisoners, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=269.18s)]
*  the massive entry of humanitarian aid, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=273.34s)]
*  and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=275.68s)]
*  and that should be the foundational rock [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  on which we can build further and end to the assault [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=281.82s)]
*  against the Palestinian people [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=285.0s)]
*  throughout the occupied Palestinian territory, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=286.18s)]
*  what we've seen, these scenes of displacement [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=288.44s)]
*  and killing in the West Bank, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=290.72s)]
*  the breach of the sacredness of our holy sites, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=292.66s)]
*  all these attacks have to cease, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=297.12s)]
*  and Israel needs to understand it is not through massacres [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=299.8s)]
*  that they will achieve anything. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  We are confronted with an attempt [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=306.36s)]
*  to liquidate the Palestinian question by force, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=308.36s)]
*  to end the Palestinian people [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  and to end the Palestinian cause, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=314.2s)]
*  and that attempt will not be successful. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=316.3s)]
*  But we also, while Israeli government [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=319.4s)]
*  tries to portray the Palestinians as monsters, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=323.0s)]
*  as human animals, which Netanyahu repeated again, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=325.32s)]
*  we cannot also expect Palestinians to be superheroes, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=329.12s)]
*  that they need to resist to all of this on their own, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  that they need to figure out a way to survive, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=336.08s)]
*  that they need to figure out to stay in their land. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=338.88s)]
*  Israel wants to convince them that if they want life, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=341.44s)]
*  they can only find it away from their land. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=344.96s)]
*  Our responsibility, our collective responsibility, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=346.76s)]
*  is to help our people find life and liberty [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=349.68s)]
*  in their own homeland. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  And the second clear demand [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  is the entry of humanitarian aid. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=357.68s)]
*  It's impossible that 20 months later [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=359.28s)]
*  and two months after a total blockade, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  we are still talking about this. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=362.84s)]
*  But Israel, after having used all the weapons of war, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=365.41999999999996s)]
*  now weaponized starvation, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  now is weaponizing the distribution of aid [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=372.16s)]
*  to fulfill its objectives [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=374.44s)]
*  of displacing the Palestinian people, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  of stealing their land. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=378.24s)]
*  We have a UN plan that we stand behind [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=380.86s)]
*  that provides all the requirements [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  to provide aid to the people [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=386.16s)]
*  and deliver it throughout the Gaza Strip, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  while providing all the safeguards that are required. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=389.56s)]
*  There is no explanation to why we would need [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=393.08000000000004s)]
*  a different mechanism, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=396.48s)]
*  except that we want to prevent people [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=397.48s)]
*  throughout the Gaza Strip from receiving the aid [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=400.32s)]
*  they desperately need. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=402.8s)]
*  These are our asks and they are very clear. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=404.12s)]
*  If you'll allow me, I'd like to say a few words [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=407.96s)]
*  in Arabic. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=409.92s)]
*  I have already said that the word Gaza alone [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=410.76s)]
*  is enough to reflect the painful reality [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=414.6s)]
*  that our people are living in. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=417.64s)]
*  And here, in front of the Security Council, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=420.44s)]
*  we ask the Security Council to take responsibility [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  and we also ask the public organizations [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=426.84s)]
*  to take responsibility, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=429.48s)]
*  and all countries to take responsibility. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=430.8s)]
*  Hardness, anger, rejection, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=435.36s)]
*  humiliation and denial are not enough. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  When children are killed, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=441.08000000000004s)]
*  when they are starved, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=442.92s)]
*  when people are burned, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=444.36s)]
*  the response will not only be hard, humiliation, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=446.68s)]
*  but action. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=450.52000000000004s)]
*  And we ask all countries to take responsibility [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=451.96000000000004s)]
*  to stop Israel and stop the exploitation [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=455.96000000000004s)]
*  of the Palestinian people [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=459.2s)]
*  and stop this rampant [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=460.88s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=664.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=666.88s)]
*  Ambassador, it's Pamela Paul from the US News and World Report. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=667.7199999999999s)]
*  Can Ambassador Abu Shahab answer the question [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=672.7199999999999s)]
*  you mentioned the June conference? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=676.12s)]
*  What kind of concrete steps are you looking at? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=678.8399999999999s)]
*  And to Ambassador Al-Tani, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  if you could talk about the ceasefire [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=684.64s)]
*  and what the future of the Palestinian people [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=686.64s)]
*  is, what are the steps you're looking at? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=688.8399999999999s)]
*  If you could talk about the ceasefire [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=692.3599999999999s)]
*  and what prospects there are for the current proposal. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=694.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=697.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=702.16s)]
*  We are following the lead of Saudi Arabia and France [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=703.0s)]
*  who have set an aim of having concrete steps [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=708.64s)]
*  that can bring us closer to a lasting peace. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=716.16s)]
*  Obviously, there are expectations of recognitions [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=722.8s)]
*  for the state of Palestine, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=726.88s)]
*  but there are other plans that I won't speak to, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=729.28s)]
*  and there are, of course, eight working groups [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=731.9599999999999s)]
*  that are working on these concrete steps. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=733.52s)]
*  Ambassador Al-Tani? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=737.8s)]
*  Yes, thank you so much. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=739.3599999999999s)]
*  I mean, the state of Qatar, of course, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=743.3199999999999s)]
*  is engaged intensively together with the United States [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=744.9599999999999s)]
*  and Egypt to stop the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=748.0s)]
*  and end this war. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=752.88s)]
*  Negotiations are ongoing on the current proposal, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=754.48s)]
*  and we are very determined, we are very determined, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=757.92s)]
*  the state of Qatar is very determined [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=761.44s)]
*  to finding an end to this horrific situation in Gaza. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=763.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=768.08s)]
*  Ambassador Rishka, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=768.92s)]
*  Abdulkhamid Sian, Al-Quds al-Arab. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=771.64s)]
*  You have been appealing to the Security Council [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=774.52s)]
*  to show that it's responsible in time and again [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=776.92s)]
*  and again and again, and the Security Council did not. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=779.6s)]
*  Four resolutions, and two in this G.A. and I.C.J. opinion, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=783.88s)]
*  yet Israel continues with its massacres. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=788.76s)]
*  What else the Arab group can do? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=792.24s)]
*  What tools you have to make this enemy [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=794.32s)]
*  or this genocidal regime pay a price? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=798.68s)]
*  So they will rethink. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=803.68s)]
*  No Arab country cut off its relationship. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=805.2s)]
*  No embassy was closed. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=808.6800000000001s)]
*  No ambassador was withdrawn. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=810.24s)]
*  So why Israel has to care for what the Arabs say of the country? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=812.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=818.84s)]
*  This is, of course, a responsibility [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=819.72s)]
*  of the international community, including the Security Council. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=822.08s)]
*  The Arab group will, as it has for the past more than 600 days, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=825.08s)]
*  been advancing and urging the Security Council to take action. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=831.76s)]
*  Of course, the Security Council has adopted some resolutions. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=840.4s)]
*  They haven't been implemented. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=843.2s)]
*  But it does not mean that we stop and stand by and fold our hands. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  So we continue to do everything that we can [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=848.48s)]
*  to ensure that this catastrophic situation doesn't continue. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=851.9200000000001s)]
*  Ambassador, I have two questions to follow that. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=856.24s)]
*  First, what kind of actions do you want to see the Security Council to act? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=859.3199999999999s)]
*  Is that would be sanctions or army bar goes from the Arab group? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=864.76s)]
*  Secondly, we know that there is a draft resolution by Algeria circulating. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=869.72s)]
*  It's been quite a while. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=874.8s)]
*  What stopped the Council from taking action of that draft resolution? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=876.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=880.48s)]
*  What we cannot say, what we cannot accept, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=881.32s)]
*  is that somehow these institutions or states are powerless [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=886.32s)]
*  before these kind of actions and these kind of crimes. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=892.24s)]
*  There are tools to respond to these kind of situations. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  We are hearing leaders considering or taking a number of decisions [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=900.24s)]
*  in the right direction, and we salute these decisions. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=904.7600000000001s)]
*  But we need to reach a decisive level. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=908.0s)]
*  It is clear that Israel until now does not feel deterred. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=911.0400000000001s)]
*  You would have seen it in their statements or in their actions [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=915.08s)]
*  had they been deterred. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=918.48s)]
*  So what we need are the actions that would deter them, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=920.12s)]
*  that would hold them accountable for the decisions they make, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=922.6s)]
*  and that would make sure that if they continue on this course, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=925.88s)]
*  they understand the consequences that they will have to face, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=928.96s)]
*  and that they will be able to make decisions [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=933.0s)]
*  that they will have to face, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=935.68s)]
*  and that will be the only way for them to finally stop what they are doing. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=937.5999999999999s)]
*  We here, our role as an Arab group in New York, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=944.5999999999999s)]
*  is to act with the Security Council, with the General Assembly. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=947.76s)]
*  It's convincing states, and there are other efforts in every capital going on, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  and that will hopefully culminate in part in the June Conference [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=956.88s)]
*  and moving forward from there. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=961.56s)]
*  But you asked about the June Conference. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=964.0s)]
*  The issue of Gaza is a part of that discussion, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=966.32s)]
*  including the Arab OIC plan that provides a real-life alternative [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=971.04s)]
*  to the catastrophe that we see before our eyes. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=975.76s)]
*  The issue of the legal obligations of third states [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=978.56s)]
*  is among the discussions we are having. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=981.96s)]
*  The issue of a sovereign and unified state of Palestine. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=985.32s)]
*  What kind of concrete commitments states are willing to take [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=989.04s)]
*  at this critical juncture? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=993.3199999999999s)]
*  This is the life and future of the Palestinian people today, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=995.52s)]
*  and of our region tomorrow that is at play. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1000.24s)]
*  So what we expect is we need to elevate our response, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1003.6s)]
*  since still now the international response has not allowed to stop Israel [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1008.12s)]
*  from the mad march it is on. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1013.76s)]
*  And that jeopardises, that constitutes an existential threat [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1016.3199999999999s)]
*  for the Palestinian people, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1019.64s)]
*  but it also jeopardises the lives of hostages and prisoners, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1021.24s)]
*  it jeopardises the future of peace and security on our region, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1025.68s)]
*  it jeopardises everything that is fundamental [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1029.88s)]
*  in the rule of international law. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1033.32s)]
*  So we will do our part here in New York [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1035.8s)]
*  in making sure that these bodies do not stay silent [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1039.92s)]
*  while a genocide is ongoing, while massacres are ongoing, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1043.96s)]
*  while starvation is ongoing. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1047.44s)]
*  What about the draft resolution? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1049.48s)]
*  So the draft resolution is being discussed as we currently speak, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1051.4s)]
*  it is an E10 effort, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1054.64s)]
*  and you will see it once they complete the consultations they are doing. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1058.28s)]
*  And as we said, our demands, I formulated them very clearly, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1062.6000000000001s)]
*  and they were mentioned by the chair of the Arab group [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1066.4s)]
*  regarding the ceasefire and ending the starvation policy that is at play. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1068.64s)]
*  And we said also we will go further in the General Assembly, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1073.8s)]
*  and states have tools at their disposal, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1077.72s)]
*  they cannot also hide from their responsibilities in using these tools, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1080.76s)]
*  and as I said, we see an important conversation going on [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1084.48s)]
*  that needs to yield concrete results and concrete decisions [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1088.5600000000002s)]
*  that are of a decisive nature. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1091.92s)]
*  What is the Arab group's reaction to the Israeli announcement [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1093.3600000000001s)]
*  that it plans to build 22 settlements in the West Bank, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1099.16s)]
*  and what impact is this going to have on the conference [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1104.84s)]
*  on a two-state solution and a two-state solution itself? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1109.44s)]
*  I think this is another decision that shows the rift [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1116.64s)]
*  between the Israeli government and the entire world. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1119.44s)]
*  Settlements are illegal, they are condemned across the world, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1122.44s)]
*  and again, maybe the international response, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1126.56s)]
*  certainly the international response needs to be much stronger [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1129.16s)]
*  to prevent such policies from moving forward. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  We are in front of an Israeli government [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1135.76s)]
*  that has an extremist ideology, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1138.44s)]
*  and I'll add to that the political ambitions of its prime ministers, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1141.76s)]
*  very opportunistic ones, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1145.6399999999999s)]
*  that are yielding what we are seeing in Gaza, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1147.6399999999999s)]
*  a full-fledged assault against the Palestinian people, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1151.04s)]
*  but also what we are seeing in the West Bank [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1153.44s)]
*  in terms of settlements, forcible displacement, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1155.44s)]
*  and the will of this Israeli government [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1159.36s)]
*  is very clearly expressed by its prime minister. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1163.9599999999998s)]
*  There is no Palestinian state, there is no Palestinian existence, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1166.24s)]
*  and so the response needs to match the words and actions [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1171.04s)]
*  of this Israeli government, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1174.1599999999999s)]
*  and that's what we will be working on, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1175.36s)]
*  whether immediately in the Security Council, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1177.56s)]
*  the General Assembly, and among states, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1179.6399999999999s)]
*  or at the June conference, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1181.4399999999998s)]
*  where you will see the entire world come together, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1183.4399999999998s)]
*  and I expect until now that given where the Israeli government is, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1186.96s)]
*  it's not in agreement with any of the fundamental rules of international law, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1192.56s)]
*  or the fundamental premise of peace in our region. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1197.56s)]
*  There are decisions of international legitimacy [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1201.24s)]
*  on which we all concur Arabs and non-Arabs. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1204.3600000000001s)]
*  The entire world has an international consensus [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1207.64s)]
*  on the two-state solution, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1210.16s)]
*  on a Palestinian state, independent and viable, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1211.24s)]
*  living side by side with Israel on the June 6, 1967 borders, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1214.72s)]
*  on the 4th of June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1221.0400000000002s)]
*  The fundamental principles of peace, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1225.0400000000002s)]
*  Israel is not willing even to come close to them. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1227.72s)]
*  That doesn't mean the world needs to change and adapt to Israeli crimes [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1230.64s)]
*  and Israeli extremism ideology. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1234.3200000000002s)]
*  It means the world needs to enact a change in Israel, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1236.5200000000002s)]
*  whereby such policies by such Israeli governments will come to an end. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1240.24s)]
*  Maybe one last question. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1244.72s)]
*  The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1245.92s)]
*  Sorry, there was... [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1247.92s)]
*  Ambassador Shehab, in your international capacity, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1249.92s)]
*  UAE has a large footprint in Gaza in the humanitarian side and medical assistance. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1253.92s)]
*  With the trickle of the couple of drops came through the aid that's been transferred, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1259.92s)]
*  how is the situation for UAE humanitarian mission operating in Gaza, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1266.92s)]
*  both on medical supplies and on aid substances? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1272.6s)]
*  Look, obviously, I'm not here to speak about the UAE. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1276.6s)]
*  We're here as representatives of the entire Arab group. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1280.6s)]
*  But I will say that, of course, the UAE uses all its channels [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1283.6s)]
*  in order to get as much humanitarian assistance into Gaza. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1288.6s)]
*  We have been a huge provider of humanitarian assistance. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1293.6s)]
*  We've been operating field hospitals, desalination plants. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1300.6799999999998s)]
*  And these efforts have never stopped. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1305.6799999999998s)]
*  And we will continue to work to scale up humanitarian assistance [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1309.6799999999998s)]
*  in every way that we can and through every channel that we can. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1316.6799999999998s)]
*  Who is funding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1319.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't have an answer to that. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1326.6799999999998s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78r87LdCbvU&t=1328.68s)]
