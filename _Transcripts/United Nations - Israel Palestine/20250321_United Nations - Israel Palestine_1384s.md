**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU)
*  I now give the floor to Mr. Sigrid Kaag. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=0.0s)]
*  Madam President, members of the Security Council, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=6.0s)]
*  before turning to read the Secretary General's report, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=9.0s)]
*  I would like to pay homage to my UN colleagues [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=13.0s)]
*  alongside all humanitarian workers in Gaza, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=16.0s)]
*  be they Palestinian and international. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=19.0s)]
*  Tragically, on the 19th of March, one UN staff member lost his life. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=22.0s)]
*  Another five UN personnel were injured in strikes at a deconflicted UN site. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=27.0s)]
*  I grieve with the family of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=33.0s)]
*  Madam President, I'd also like to express my profound alarm [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=39.0s)]
*  at the resumption of hostilities in Gaza this week, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=44.0s)]
*  which has already killed hundreds, mostly women and children. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=47.0s)]
*  And I would like to echo the Secretary General's call [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=51.0s)]
*  for the resumption of serious negotiations for the ceasefire, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=54.0s)]
*  unimpeded humanitarian access, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=58.0s)]
*  and for the remaining hostages to be released immediately and unconditionally. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=61.0s)]
*  Madam President, members of the Security Council, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=68.0s)]
*  I now turn to the reading of the 33rd report of the Secretary General [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=71.0s)]

*  in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=100.0s)]
*  and to fully respect all of its legal obligations in this regard. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=105.0s)]

*  One, the Secretary General once again strongly condemns the horrific acts of terror by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups on the 7th of October, 2023, and the continued holding of hostages in Gaza. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=892.0s)]
*  Hostages must be released immediately and unconditionally. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=905.0s)]
*  The Secretary General also condemns reported ill-treatment of hostages, as well as the fact that there are reasonable grounds to believe the hostages may be subjected to sexual violence and abuse. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=910.0s)]
*  The Secretary General also reiterates his condemnation of Hamas abhorrent public displays accompanying the release of living and deceased hostages. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=921.0s)]
*  While in captivity, hostages must be treated humanely and allowed to receive assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cross. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=931.0s)]
*  Two, the Secretary General again unequivocally condemns the widespread killing and injury of civilians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Gaza. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=939.0s)]

*  Humanitarian aid is not negotiable. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1059.0s)]
*  While the surge in humanitarian aid has been crucial to saving lives in Gaza, the humanitarian situation remains catastrophic. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1062.0s)]
*  The UN has proven that with access, the coordinated response can deliver aid people need. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1070.0s)]
*  The Secretary General strongly condemns the halting of humanitarian assistance into Gaza by Israeli authorities and urges the immediate resumption of humanitarian and commercial deliveries. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1076.0s)]
*  Six, the escalation of violence in the occupied West Bank is deeply troubling. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1088.0s)]
*  Alongside the rising death toll, Palestine refugee camps in the northern West Bank are being emptied and are sustaining massive infrastructural damage during Israeli operations. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1093.0s)]
*  The number of displaced Palestinians continues to rise and residents continue to be denied the right to return home. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1104.0s)]
*  The Secretary General is deeply concerned by any long-term presence of Israeli security forces in the camps, which would further undermine the Palestinian authority and be contrary to Israel's obligation to end its unlawful continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory as affirmed by the International Court of Justice. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1111.0s)]
*  Seven, the Secretary General urges security forces to exercise maximum restraint and use lethal force only when it's strictly unavoidable to protect life. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1131.0s)]

*  The Secretary General is alarmed by the lethal attacks carried out by Israeli settlers against Palestinians, including sometimes in the proximity and with the support of the Israeli security forces, as well as by Palestinians against Israelis. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1150.0s)]
*  All perpetrators must be held accountable. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1165.0s)]
*  The continued use of heavy weaponry in the occupied West Bank, including in residential areas, is extremely concerning. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1169.0s)]
*  The Secretary General also recalls that Israel, as the occupying power, has a responsibility to ensure that the civilian population is protected against all acts of violence. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1176.0s)]
*  The relentless expansion of Israeli settlements, eight, is dramatically altering the landscape and demographics of the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1186.0s)]
*  Palestinians are increasingly confined into shrinking and disconnected areas, presenting an existential threat to the prospect of a contiguous, viable, independent Palestinian state. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1196.0s)]
*  The Secretary General reiterates that settlements have no legal validity and can constitute a flagrant violation of international law. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1208.0s)]
*  The demolition and seizure of Palestinian-owned structures entail numerous human rights violations and raise concerns about the risk of forcible transfer. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1216.0s)]
*  The Secretary General once again urges the government of Israel to abide by its obligation under international law and recall the finding by the International Court of Justice in its advisory opinion of 19th of July 2024, which declared inter alia that the state of Israel is under an obligation to cease immediately all new settlement activities and to evacuate all settlers from the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1225.0s)]
*  Nine, the Secretary General reiterates his call to the parties for the status quo at the holy sites in Jerusalem to be respected and upheld, taking into account the special and historic role of Jordan. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1252.0s)]
*  Ten, the implementation of two Knesset laws concerning UNRWA could dramatically hinder efforts to ease human suffering. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1264.0s)]
*  The Secretary General reiterates there is no alternative to UNRWA. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1272.0s)]
*  He condemns the breach of the inviolability of the United Nations premises in the occupied Palestinian territory and the attempt to forcibly enter UNRWA schools and to seek their closure. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1276.0s)]
*  National legislation cannot alter Israel's obligation under international law. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1286.0s)]
*  Eleven, the Secretary General welcomes ongoing efforts by regional countries, international partners and the Palestinian Authority to plan for Gaza's reconstruction, including the Gaza reconstruction plan endorsed by and at the Arab League Organization of Islamic Cooperation. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1293.0s)]
*  The UN will continue to work closely with the Palestinian Authority and all stakeholders to ensure a future for Gaza that provides for protection, recovery and reconstruction for Palestinians to remain in Gaza and security for Israel. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1310.0s)]
*  This will require establishing appropriate security in government's frameworks. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1325.0s)]
*  Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, must be treated as one, politically, economically and administratively. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1330.0s)]
*  Twelve, we must work collectively to establish a political framework that outlines tangible, irreversible and time-bound steps. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1340.0s)]
*  The occupation must end as rapidly as possible. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1349.0s)]
*  A viable two-state solution, Israel and Palestine, of which Gaza is an integral part, living side by side in peace and security on the basis of United Nations resolutions, previous agreements and international law, with Jerusalem as the capital of both states, is long overdue. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1352.0s)]
*  The United Nations will continue to support all efforts towards that goal. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1370.0s)]
*  End of reading. Thank you. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQfIx9uCtU&t=1375.0s)]
