Video Description: Press Conference: Matthew Hollingworth, World Food Program (WFP) Country Director in Palestine on the situation in Gaza.

Far too little aid is reaching people in Gaza to the extent that children are now starving, UN humanitarians said on Friday, in a renewed appeal to Israel to respect international law regarding the safe passage of lifesaving relief in the war-shattered enclave.

The alert from the World Health Organization (WHO) follows the finding that more than four in five children “did not eat for a whole day at least once in the three days” ahead of a food insecurity survey.

Hunger snapshot
“These are children under five who are not getting food all day,” said WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris. “So, you ask, ‘Are the supplies getting through?’ No, children are starving.”

Additional worrying data from the food insecurity snapshot survey indicated that almost all of the youngsters surveyed in Gaza now eat just two different food groups per day, when the WHO recommendation is at least five.

According to an update this week from the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, since mid-January, more than 93,400 children under five have been screened for malnutrition in Gaza; 7,280 were found to have acute malnutrition, including 5,604 with moderate acute malnutrition and 1,676 with severe acute malnutrition.

Preventable horrors
Echoing those concerns, OCHA highlighted the risk of deadly malnutrition and famine among Gaza’s most vulnerable individuals. 

“I would say they are certainly not getting the amount that they desperately need to prevent a famine, to prevent all kind of horrors that we see. It’s very, very little that is going around at the moment,” said OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke. 

Responding to questions about aid access obstacles, he reiterated that the Israeli authorities’ obligations under international humanitarian law to facilitate the delivery of aid “does not stop at the border. It does not stop when you drop off just a few metres across the border and then drive away and then leave it to humanitarians to drive through active combat zones - which they cannot do - to pick it up. So, to answer your question, no, the aid that is getting in, is not getting to the people.”

Amid ongoing reports of deadly Israeli bombardment across Gaza on Friday, humanitarians continued to stress that land crossings for aid convoys remain “the only way to get (aid) in at scale and at speed…We need more of these land crossings and we need them open and we need them safe for use to pick up the aid when it’s dropped off,” the OCHA spokesperson said.

# Gaza: Children are starving amid persistent aid access obstacles, warn UN agencies | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0)
*  I hope so. I'm here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=0.0s)]
*  Hi Matt. Good morning. Thank you so much for coming on a Friday morning to listen to a briefing by Mr. Matthew Hollingworth, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=4.0s)]
*  the WFP country director in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Thank you Matt for being with us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=16.0s)]
*  Matt will be making an introductory remark and then we can take a few questions. Please go ahead. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=22.0s)]
*  Thank you so much Shereen and good morning to you all from Jerusalem. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=28.0s)]
*  Clearly I came out of Gaza the beginning of last week having spent 10 days with our teams there working in Gaza City, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=36.0s)]
*  the middle areas out of Dara Bella and also in Rafeh. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=47.0s)]
*  Once again we're seeing civilians in Gaza paying the highest price of political failure of war, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=51.0s)]
*  especially children, especially old people, vulnerable people who at this stage are beyond exhausted [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=60.0s)]
*  from persistent and continuous rounds of displacement, from hunger, from trauma and from absolute fear of what comes next. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=69.0s)]
*  People really are at their wits end and living hand to mouth in what are horrific and precarious situations. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=82.0s)]
*  The exodus that we've seen in the past 20 days or so out of Rafeh has been an awesome and horrific experience for many, many people. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=95.0s)]
*  Most of them who have been displaced on multiple occasions in the past and thought they were staying in a safe area for the remainder of the war, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=109.0s)]
*  thought that the services that were being provided to them, the aid infrastructure that was created around them to support them would be continuing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=122.0s)]
*  And many of those people now have left that certainty, that constant level of albeit mediocre support, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=132.0s)]
*  but support to go to somewhere new and to go to places where clean water supply is insufficient, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=143.0s)]
*  where medical supplies and support is insufficient, where there's barely enough fuel to keep basic services running, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=152.0s)]
*  where food and in particular free and unconditional assistance of food is limited, where telecommunications have stopped because comms companies don't have the fuel to keep their generators running, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=161.0s)]
*  and where people are living in levels of congestion that means public health concerns are beyond crisis levels, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=177.0s)]
*  where children are 40 times more likely to have diarrhea, where there's insufficient space to dig clean and appropriate numbers of pit latrines, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=190.0s)]
*  where the sounds, the smells, the everyday life are horrific and apocalyptic. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=203.0s)]
*  People sleep to the sounds of bombing, they sleep to the sounds of drones, they sleep to the sounds of war, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=215.0s)]
*  as now tanks roll into parts of central Raffa, which is only kilometres away, and they wake to the same sounds. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=221.0s)]
*  I have spoken to so many people over the last few, of those last 10 days that I was there, who asked me, you know, should we try and leave? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=231.0s)]
*  Should we try and storm the border to Egypt? Should we try and go back to Gaza City? What should we do? Help? What should we do? We don't know what to do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=242.0s)]
*  Where can I get the aid that I knew where I used to get it from? I knew that there was a distribution on a Monday, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=252.0s)]
*  and now I don't know what's coming next. I knew where the water donkey would be at each hour of each day, and I knew how long the queues would be. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=259.0s)]
*  I don't know that anymore. How can you help? What can you do? And of course, unfortunately, we've seen ever decreasing amounts of assistance going in from our side, too. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=271.0s)]
*  Raffa is still closed as a border crossing. World Food Programme bakeries in Raffa have all closed down, for the lack of fuel and constant supplies being impossible. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=282.0s)]
*  From the 7th to the 20th of May, not a single WFP truck crossed from the southern corridors from Egypt into Raffa, into indeed the central areas from the southern corridor. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=293.0s)]
*  And we were unable to have access to our main warehouse for the south because it was in an evacuation zone. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=308.0s)]
*  And since we have lost that warehouse entirely, including its entire contents of 2700 tons of food that's either been looted or destroyed because of the fighting around the eastern, the southeastern areas of Raffa. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=318.0s)]
*  We are, yeah, living and working precariously in the south. We have some partners who are able to provide hot meals in Raffa. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=334.0s)]
*  We serve around 27000 people right now, but that's not enough in Raffa itself. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=344.0s)]
*  And we're trying desperately hard to gear up to support people in the central areas in Al Mawassi, in particular, where almost a million people have fled to in this great exodus. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=352.0s)]
*  In that middle area, we are able to provide around 400000 hot meals a day. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=365.0s)]
*  And that's what we've prioritized because we have again limited supplies. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=372.0s)]
*  We do not have the supplies available to provide significant numbers of ready to eat ration boxes. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=377.0s)]
*  We don't have significant supplies of wheat flour to hand out to those families that have a stove to cook on. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=388.0s)]
*  And our support to bakeries is precarious, but we are able to keep six bakeries functioning in the middle area between Derebella and Kha Nunes serving the Al Mawassi area. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=395.0s)]
*  With the limitations of aid through the southern corridors, we will no doubt see what we saw happen in the south. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=408.0s)]
*  In the first months of the war, when you do not have consistent at volume levels of aid, which is free and unconditional going to families, their well-being, their health deteriorates. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=420.0s)]
*  While we have seen increased amounts of commercial assistance going in, we've unfortunately seen a lot of the same. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=432.0s)]
*  I've met many families who have used their identification cards, their entire family's identification cards as collateral to pay for goods for food from the market. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=442.0s)]
*  And in doing so, putting their own safety and future in jeopardy because they need those identification cards to register for aid in the future. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=455.0s)]
*  So to give them away is no small thing. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=465.0s)]
*  We also hear of other people getting involved in more desperate forms of trade in order to receive the commercial assistance. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=468.0s)]
*  We have seen a lot of the same. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=478.0s)]

*  their needs, if not, but not all of their needs. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=570.82s)]
*  In the North, on the other hand, we're actually seeing the results of what can happen when [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=575.04s)]
*  there is a will to enable sufficient levels of aid. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=580.74s)]
*  So in what was the epicentre of the imminent famine warning that came with the last integrated [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=586.54s)]
*  phase classification report in March, so Gaza City, Jaberlia, Beit Hanun, Beit Lahya in [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=593.9399999999999s)]
*  the North, what we've seen in the month of May with the opening, first of Eris and then [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=601.02s)]
*  laterally of Eris West crossings, has been some form of improvement. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=607.3s)]
*  Around 12,000 tonnes of interagency assistance, predominantly food, from multiple partners, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=616.18s)]
*  including the World Food Programme, but many other partners as well, have been able to [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=622.8599999999999s)]
*  get into the North since the 1st of May. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=626.78s)]
*  And the North looks very different because of it. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=629.6999999999999s)]
*  Six weeks ago in Gaza City, you saw very few people. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=633.9s)]
*  When you did see people, they were gaunt, they were sickly, they were tired, they were [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=639.86s)]
*  traumatised and they were only risking moving around in order to find either aid, something [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=645.1s)]
*  to trade, something that they could take, whether it be a ready-to-eat ration from the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=653.3s)]
*  skies, from the air drops, or something they could borrow or barter with their community. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=661.42s)]
*  Today you see streets full of people in Gaza City and part of that is because there has [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=669.22s)]
*  been a step change and improvement in terms of availability of food and in particular [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=675.02s)]
*  availability of commodities, unconditional and free to support them. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=682.1s)]
*  That's not to say that issues are not resolved there, because they are resolved there, because [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=688.34s)]
*  they're not. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=692.9s)]
*  There's still problems of clean water supply, there's still problems of healthcare and the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=695.02s)]
*  adequate provision of healthcare. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=700.0600000000001s)]
*  There's horrific problems with garbage and rubbish rotting in the streets, with sewage [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=702.1s)]
*  being pumped and with just general issues with what are the millions of tonnes of rubble [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=709.74s)]
*  which people need to traverse to move around in parts of Gaza City and Jabari in the north. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=719.9s)]
*  Calls to action have predominantly been going to deaf ears, I fear, but fundamentally what [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=729.4599999999999s)]
*  we need of course is an immediate ceasefire. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=738.5799999999999s)]
*  We are tired, people are tired, we desperately need to start helping people go beyond this [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=742.4599999999999s)]
*  day-to-day existence and scraping for an existence and to do that there has to be a ceasefire. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=750.4599999999999s)]
*  That also means hostages need to be released, there needs to be no excuse for this war and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=758.54s)]
*  no justification for this war to continue. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=763.66s)]
*  All those people suffering because of this war need that respite and it's tangible when [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=767.62s)]
*  you spend time in Gaza at any point right now. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=775.14s)]
*  We know that that may not happen immediately, so in the meantime we are calling for those [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=782.78s)]
*  southern corridors that I mentioned earlier to be open fully, for there to be better coordination [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=789.0200000000001s)]
*  between the aid and the trade deliveries that do go in. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=796.3000000000001s)]
*  We're not saying that commercial cargo isn't needed, it is, but it's about the appropriateness [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=800.3000000000001s)]
*  of what goes in, it's about the equity from the aid and the trade side, it's about ensuring [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=806.1400000000001s)]
*  dignity is truly respected for Gazans of what is being sent in. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=812.14s)]
*  They need the basic services to run, that means they need diesel coming in every day, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=819.18s)]
*  every other day or in small supply. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=826.14s)]
*  They need the medical supplies, the nutritious food. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=829.5s)]
*  We need humanitarians to be able to come in and rotate out on a regular basis so that we [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=832.46s)]
*  can do our all and be as efficient and effective as we can be to support Gazans. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=837.82s)]
*  We need the environment to change, we need the trust and the confidence between the parties [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=845.5s)]
*  and the aid workers to improve so that we can have access and the space to do what we need to do to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=850.22s)]
*  help people living what is already a perilous existence, but will also be perilous post-cease [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=858.62s)]
*  fire just because of the horrific environment that they now find is their home. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=867.58s)]
*  I'll stop there. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=874.38s)]
*  Thank you Matt, thank you so much. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=875.6600000000001s)]
*  I'll give the floor to questions now here and then we'll go online. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=877.0200000000001s)]
*  Sharifa, please go ahead. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=882.86s)]
*  Thank you Mr. Hollingworth. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=888.46s)]
*  I wanted to ask you a question about the US floating pier in Gaza. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=890.0600000000001s)]
*  As you know, it's costing more than $300 million and it came apart in one week due to winds and [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=894.22s)]
*  high seas. So do you think instead of wasting the money on the pier, the US could have instead [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=900.94s)]
*  pressured Israel to let more aid in and the US has also announced that it has halted air drops [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=906.22s)]
*  due to heavy bombardments of the IDF and from your briefing and all the other briefings we've [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=912.38s)]
*  been following the situation on the ground is clear and that Gazans are starving. So [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=918.22s)]
*  if the pier does become operational again, do you think Israel will allow fast, safe and unhindered [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=923.5s)]
*  delivery of the aid considering all the restrictions that it applied [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=930.14s)]
*  during the last eight months to all the aid deliveries through land routes? Thank you. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=934.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=943.34s)]
*  Sharif, would you like me to answer straight away? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=945.02s)]
*  Yes please Matt, go ahead. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=946.86s)]
*  So the maritime operation, as you rightly said, is on hiatus at the moment as there are repairs [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=950.46s)]
*  made to the Trident Pier and the floating dock. I have to say that we had, as you are aware, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=959.42s)]
*  a number of concerns about the pier before it became operational and many conditions that we [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=969.42s)]
*  had very open discussions about to ensure that if it was put in place that actually the humanitarian [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=975.74s)]
*  impact would be genuine and I have to say that even in a relative short period of time, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=984.14s)]
*  although we were only able to move in just under a thousand tons of aid, it's life-saving aid [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=992.46s)]
*  and it was a thousand tons that came in addition to what we were doing from [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=999.42s)]
*  Eris West and at the time Karam Shalom, although Karam Shalom then became harder to utilise. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1003.74s)]
*  The real benefit of the maritime operation has come from what I believe is the beginning of an [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1012.3s)]
*  improved method of a coordination between the humanitarian actors and the Israeli defence forces [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1021.26s)]
*  because with the creation of the JLOTs, as it's known, a very intensive and I would say at this [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1028.3s)]
*  point well coordinated centre was created to make sure that we have a real-time ability to troubleshoot [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1038.46s)]
*  and find solutions to move aid faster around the Gaza Strip from the JLOTs and we're hoping [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1047.8999999999999s)]
*  that the lessons that can be learned from that will actually improve the delivery of assistance, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1055.0200000000002s)]
*  the efficiency of the delivery of assistance writ large across the Strip. If that isn't indeed the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1061.66s)]
*  case, it will be worth the investment because one of our greatest challenges, if not the greatest [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1068.3000000000002s)]
*  challenge over the past seven months, has not been necessarily the physical challenge of delivering [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1075.18s)]
*  in a war zone but rather the political challenges of having safe, expedited, efficient and constant [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1083.74s)]
*  ability to communicate so that we can really bring volumes of aid that will change the situation for [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1095.66s)]
*  the most vulnerable. If that comes out of it, it will be money worth spent but bottom line [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1104.78s)]
*  very clear the JLOTs was only ever built to be supplement to the overland corridors, corridors [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1114.14s)]
*  that would be fed from Ashdod itself, the port, Israel's port, from the Jordan corridor and indeed [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1122.5400000000002s)]
*  from Egypt. So as long as those overland corridors into the Strip are operational, JLOTs not only [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1130.22s)]
*  supplements the physical delivery but potentially will support the means to coordinate more efficient [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1138.54s)]
*  deliveries in the future. Thank you, Matt. Let's take Kristen first. Please go ahead. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1145.26s)]
*  Hi, thank you so much. Kristen Salumi from Al Jazeera. You mentioned some of the numbers of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1152.86s)]
*  the people that you're able to serve, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1160.3000000000002s)]
*  27,000 in RAFA, 400,000 hot meals a day. Given the needs are so great, how do you determine who gets [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1164.7s)]
*  the help and when? How does that play out? And I'm also wondering about how you communicate with [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1175.0200000000002s)]
*  people there? How are people getting information about aid and where to go? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1182.6200000000001s)]
*  And are you even able to communicate with staff there, never mind the regular people? Thank you. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1190.14s)]
*  Thank you very much, Kristen. Very good questions. I mean, the toughest job any humanitarian will [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1200.46s)]
*  ever have to do is make the distinction and the decisions on vulnerability and targeting. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1207.82s)]
*  We have had to, in the past weeks, take decisions to focus more on areas where newly displaced [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1216.78s)]
*  people were arriving with nothing rather than people who had been able to stay in a shelter [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1225.34s)]
*  or a location where they were already displaced some weeks or months before. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1234.38s)]
*  So you take really tough decisions. And it has consequences because it means the lives [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1239.3400000000001s)]
*  and the well-being of the people that you target away from, their well-being will suffer. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1244.7800000000002s)]
*  But we don't really do it because we know that many of those newly displaced families will arrive [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1253.1000000000001s)]
*  with nothing and they will be unable to look after themselves. Hence our focus on ensuring there are [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1259.18s)]
*  hot meals available, at least one a day for those people. And what we do try and do, of course, is to [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1265.5800000000002s)]
*  spend as much time on the ground with our monitors, with our partners. We have 13 partners across [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1276.3s)]
*  the Gaza Strip who help us to communicate with those that we serve. In areas where communications [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1283.5s)]
*  function, and there are still some areas where the cell phone actually still functions in terms [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1292.3s)]
*  of the network, not everywhere, we have self-registration applications that people [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1299.82s)]
*  can use to identify themselves and identify their greater vulnerability and need. And of course, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1306.7s)]
*  we work very closely with all other actors in the humanitarian community, with UN actors and [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1312.14s)]
*  as well as non-governmental organisations to help identify the most in need and make sure that we [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1320.14s)]
*  are focusing on them. Communications is a nightmare. At least two of the Palestinian networks, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1326.22s)]
*  one has failed entirely in the south as of I think yesterday now, and another will go shortly [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1334.94s)]
*  because they can't access their equipment and they can't actually ensure they have fuel for [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1340.78s)]
*  their generators to run the communications. It's one of our biggest and has been one of our biggest [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1345.42s)]
*  challenges throughout. Talking to our own people is very difficult and we have to use multiple [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1351.82s)]
*  forms of communications just to try and track and make sure that we know where people are and we also [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1359.18s)]
*  give them an opportunity to tell us if they come into any danger or any trouble. But it is, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1365.98s)]
*  it's again, it's constantly one of our issues and one of our advocacy points is to ensure that we [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1372.94s)]
*  have more forms of communication devices, we have redundancy in terms of communication so that if [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1378.38s)]
*  things do fail, we have at least some fail safe form of speaking to people. Thank you, Matt. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1385.82s)]
*  Let's go to Ibtissam. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you. My name is Ibtissam Azem, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1392.54s)]
*  Al Arabi Al Jadid newspaper. I have first a few follow-ups. You said that when it comes to the [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1397.98s)]
*  peer answering my colleague Sharifa, that you were able to deliver 1,000 tonne. Would you, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1405.8999999999999s)]
*  could you put this in perspective? What does that even mean? Like what in average do you need daily [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1415.6599999999999s)]
*  for people in Gaza? How many tonnes of food or aid you need daily in Gaza? And then also, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1423.18s)]
*  I'm sorry if you said it at the beginning because I came two minutes late. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1432.7800000000002s)]
*  What is the percentage of people who are food insecure and acutely food insecure? Phases four [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1437.8200000000002s)]
*  and five. And also, is it still the case that any aid that enters Gaza needs to go through [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1443.9s)]
*  the Israeli different checks? And finally, sorry, too many follow-ups. But my question is, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1454.94s)]
*  if you could walk us through what a family in Gaza that is looking for food, which hurdles they have [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1463.5800000000002s)]
*  to go through in their daily life to get one meal or to skip maybe a meal the whole day. Thank you. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1471.26s)]
*  Thank you. I mean, so in a relatively short period of time, we did, we were able to bring in [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1483.74s)]
*  just under 1,000 tonnes of interagency. So multiple organisations, utilising the jail. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1491.18s)]
*  And to put that into comparison, if you think in the month of April, just WFP, we brought around [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1499.66s)]
*  20,000 tonnes of assistance through just through Karam Shalom, just in April. So jail lots started [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1507.9s)]
*  to become something that could be significant. But as I said, it would not be a replacement [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1517.18s)]
*  for a corridor as important as Karam Shalom, or for that matter, a replacement for a corridor [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1523.82s)]
*  as important now as the Erez or Erez West corridor. In May alone through Erez West, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1529.26s)]
*  we've brought in 12,000 tonnes of, again, interagency, both UN and NGO cargo. So, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1536.46s)]
*  you know, they are the mainstay of the delivery. When you start to look at what you need in entirety [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1544.3s)]
*  for the whole of Gaza, when we look at food, just food assistance, we should be trying to bring in [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1551.58s)]
*  around 45,000 tonnes of food, free, unconditional support each month. And that's not just WFP, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1559.34s)]
*  that's across the food sector and different organisations bringing in forms of food assistance. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1567.8999999999999s)]
*  And now in terms of when we have been able to do that, we've had better months and we've had [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1574.14s)]
*  poorer months. This is a tough month. We've had significant reductions because, as we said, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1583.34s)]
*  those southern corridors have not been functioning since, as they should, since the incursion on the [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1588.94s)]
*  7th of May. When you look now at the criticality of the food situation, I mean, we don't have the [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1595.5s)]
*  latest rounds of the integrated phase classification analysis complete yet. It's due to come out in the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1604.7s)]
*  middle of June and that will really then tell us where we are with people who are facing catastrophic [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1611.58s)]
*  food insecurity and emergency levels of food insecurity. What we are completely cognisant of [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1617.82s)]
*  is that when you look at the communities who have been displaced yet again, we are very concerned [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1624.78s)]
*  about growing acute food insecurity amongst that cohort, amongst that population. And a million [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1631.74s)]
*  people being displaced yet again into a highly congested area with very significant public health [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1640.3s)]
*  concerns and water concerns and sanitation concerns. It doesn't bode well for their well-being [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1650.78s)]
*  and health. So we are really concerned about that community now. As I've said, we've seen that [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1659.02s)]
*  moderate improvement in the north. We need to continue that level of assistance and we need [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1665.98s)]
*  to expand it across various sectors, particularly around nutrition, health, sanitation and water [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1672.3s)]
*  supply, clean water supply, for us to really be able to sustain the improvements in the north, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1679.74s)]
*  in Gaza City that we've started to see in the past month. And all assistance that is brought into [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1686.46s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, whether it's from the southern corridors or the northern corridor or indeed [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1694.6200000000001s)]
*  jail lots, is indeed screened before it arrives and that is still the process. There are no [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1698.78s)]
*  areas or entry points where that screening does not apply. We would like it to be faster, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1707.02s)]
*  we would like it to improve and most importantly we would like the access and the humanitarian [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1715.82s)]
*  space inside the Strip where it's far more complicated in terms of the supply chain management, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1722.54s)]
*  we'd like that to improve as well. What are families going through? If you look at the [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1728.3s)]
*  people who have had to move in the last two, three weeks, everybody has to get used to a completely [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1737.5s)]
*  new situation. Where they sought refuge for a month is no longer where they will be. They're [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1746.54s)]
*  no longer staying with the same community. They may no longer be with their family members or [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1755.9s)]
*  larger family members because there's simply not the space for them to go and live in the same [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1761.82s)]
*  place. The level of aid has changed and the organisations that serve them have changed. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1767.58s)]
*  The schedules have changed if indeed there are schedules. It's very complicated. I've spoken to [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1772.78s)]
*  mothers and their children who have said we just don't know how this works yet. How has it changed [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1779.74s)]
*  so much? They are desperate and they need that form of assistance but it's very, very difficult [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1785.66s)]
*  in such an enclosed small area, congested as it is with this enormous density of people. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1794.22s)]
*  A journey that used to take us 45 minutes from our hub in Raffa to our hub in Darro Bella is now two [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1802.5400000000002s)]
*  and a half hours because you're literally driving on a main road through an area where you [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1808.78s)]
*  drive as fast as somebody walks because the place is so packed with people all looking to find the [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1815.66s)]
*  form of assistance that they once knew how to find and where to access. Thank you Matt. Let's [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1822.22s)]
*  go first to the screen and then we'll come back to the room. Abdul Hamid you had a question. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1828.22s)]
*  Please go ahead. Yes thank you so much Mr. Hollenworth. My name is Abdul Hamid Sayyama [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1832.7s)]
*  from the Arabic daily Al-Quds Al-Arabi. I have a few follow-ups and questions also [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1840.54s)]
*  with my colleagues Sharifah and Ibtisam about the floating pier. I want to ask why WFP was selected [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1847.82s)]
*  to be the distributor and UNRWA was not and I want you to tell me also about the relation between [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1856.06s)]
*  UNRWA and WFP and if UNRWA is declared as the Israeli Knesset is planning to do as a terrorist [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1864.62s)]
*  organization how that will affect humanitarian work in Gaza altogether and recently another [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1874.1399999999999s)]
*  baby died I think he's he or she's six months you're old and so can you talk about those [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1884.4599999999998s)]
*  infants who died out of hunger and finally as you see you know there is mass killing [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1891.1000000000001s)]
*  there is mass hunger the mass movement mass displacement mass destruction of the health system [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1900.5400000000002s)]
*  mass destruction of the educational system could it be called other than collective punishment [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1908.38s)]
*  and water crime sir thank you [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1914.6999999999998s)]
*  thank you and [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1921.1799999999998s)]
*  in terms of how and why WFP was was asked to facilitate the delivery of [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1925.8999999999999s)]
*  humanitarian assistance from the civilian side of this particular entry point into the Gaza Strip [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1934.3799999999999s)]
*  it's essentially based on the World Food Program's global responsibility that was given to us through [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1943.26s)]
*  the inter-agency standing committee which is a rather complicated but a committee that's created [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1951.34s)]
*  of of UN non-governmental organizations as well as donor member state membership it was given to us [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1957.5s)]
*  because we were identified as one of the largest global [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1966.7s)]
*  logistics expert organizations from the humanitarian field and we have that global [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1971.82s)]
*  experience from working in in more than 80 countries and delivering significant volumes [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1978.46s)]
*  of food assistance primarily but also other forms of aid across the the various clusters and sectors [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1985.18s)]
*  that make up the the ecosystem of humanitarian organizations so we were asked because there [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=1992.94s)]
*  were organizations that wanted a humanitarian agency to take on that role and for that we [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2000.94s)]
*  we would do similar things in other operating environments in other countries when and if asked [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2011.42s)]
*  and indeed have done so in many other operations around the world [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2018.54s)]
*  our relationship as the World Food Program with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2024.38s)]
*  for Palestine Refugees is a strong one and a long and an old one and the the World Food Program [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2031.18s)]
*  has worked in coordination and sometimes in support of UNRWA in Gaza and in and in surrounding [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2038.86s)]
*  countries and in the West Bank for many many years and we continue to do so we coordinate [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2046.94s)]
*  very closely with them in this crisis and indeed we have we provide support logistically [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2052.78s)]
*  when they when they need our support and frankly they also support us as they support all other [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2061.42s)]
*  parts of the humanitarian you know ecosystem inside Gaza utilizing their warehousing capacity [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2068.06s)]
*  when required supporting people who are sheltering in their facilities schools clinics hospitals [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2075.58s)]
*  wherever people have have sought refuge and and their support then as UNRWA to facilitate multiple [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2084.06s)]
*  organizations to meet the needs of of Palestinians that need some form of support so we have a very [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2093.18s)]
*  close relationship working relationship as does the entirety of the ecosystem and we will continue [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2099.2599999999998s)]
*  to support that and when I may ask Shereen to comment because I think the Secretary General [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2105.42s)]
*  has been very very clear and has provided the leadership and direction for the entire United [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2112.46s)]
*  Nations on what is our direction when it comes to the support we give to UNRWA so that they can [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2117.58s)]
*  alleviate the the vulnerabilities and the needs that Palestinians face across Gaza and we have [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2126.46s)]
*  not wavered from that so we continue to support and work with them very closely and I mean I think [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2135.82s)]
*  that's that's you know that has not changed in terms of of whatever political views on the [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2144.06s)]
*  environment and how this this war is seen again I'll ask Shereen perhaps the Deputy Spokesperson to [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2156.62s)]
*  to respond to that particular question in terms of children and the impact of hunger and malnutrition [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2164.46s)]
*  on children it is the hardest part of what we see inside Gaza and indeed we are fully aware of [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2171.5s)]
*  the one case recently that was publicized but we're also aware of many stories of the of many more [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2179.9s)]
*  cases that aren't always publicized that are very private and it's one of the hardest things to see [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2187.66s)]
*  is the the cumulative impact of a war that has seen the such a speedy deterioration [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2196.94s)]
*  in in particular children's lives and the most vulnerable and in terms of people with with [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2208.62s)]
*  pre-existing ailments etc old people because it's again it's not only about there being [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2214.14s)]
*  an insufficient food supply it's about having insufficient access to clean water it's about [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2221.98s)]
*  sanitation being as poor as it is it's about people's living you know environments staying in [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2229.58s)]
*  cold and damp or hot and humid tents with flies and mosquitoes and refuse and and you know public [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2238.06s)]
*  health issues abundant and and it is unfortunately something we will see more of [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2248.46s)]
*  unless these key issues can be resolved and those key issues will only really be resolvable [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2255.9s)]
*  when the ceasefire that we are asking for comes about thank you matt and we're here indeed to [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2262.78s)]
*  listen to you we have some limited time let's take another question from Lee Keith AP are you online [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2269.18s)]
*  uh yes i'm here yes please go ahead thank you um thank you mr holland for this uh this briefing [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2276.86s)]
*  uh i wanted to ask a little go back to the question of coordination especially at carrom shalom [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2285.18s)]
*  um the the carrom abu salim um the kogat sort of i mean the as as you've said and as the un has [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2291.5s)]
*  been saying for the past three weeks they just haven't been able to reach the crossing to bring [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2299.66s)]
*  the crossing to bring out trucks as far as we understand to retrieve the trucks that are coming [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2304.38s)]
*  in the israelis keep saying we're sending trucks in um and you know all it they yesterday at a [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2309.58s)]
*  briefing kogat basically answers was all they have to do is coordinate with us i'm i'm just [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2318.38s)]
*  wondering if you can give us a sort of closer detailed picture of what is the issue of reaching [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2324.78s)]
*  that crossing what are the issues in coordination there um why are why are commercial trucks able [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2331.58s)]
*  to get through that crossing and into gaza while while the un is has uh has has not been able to [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2340.22s)]
*  um and in connection to that i think if i can also ask about the commercial trucks [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2347.58s)]
*  you mentioned prioritization of commercial trucks has the prioritization of commercial [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2353.8199999999997s)]
*  trucks impacted the number of un trucks that are able to get in [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2358.46s)]
*  okay thanks lee um so i mean again carrom shalom has been open to us um at least the world food [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2367.7400000000002s)]
*  program we've started to be able to have access to to bring in trucks to load um since the 20th [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2379.1s)]
*  um however uh obviously accessing carrom shalom carrom abu selim means going through what was [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2385.2599999999998s)]
*  the former rafa crossing and the the cargo consolidation hub there to get to the cargo [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2394.22s)]
*  consolidation hub and the and the former raf rafa crossing um you have to go into an area that was [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2400.8599999999997s)]
*  ordered to be evacuated early on in this incursion that area was forcibly evacuated because it was a [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2408.22s)]
*  war zone and people were fighting and there were tanks rolling in and infantry troops going in [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2415.5s)]
*  and that still continues and that situation has not stopped it may have changed militarily but [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2421.2599999999998s)]
*  in terms of violence it's still a violent area to do that to get in to those areas the united nations [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2427.58s)]
*  and other humanitarian organizations need to coordinate every movement coordination is the [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2437.1s)]
*  most vigorous form of what is the rather cumbersome but necessary um process to get safe access so [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2443.1s)]
*  that when we send trucks and people in to escort those trucks they're not going to come under fire [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2451.18s)]
*  they're not going to be mistaken for belligerent they're not going to um endanger themselves in [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2456.2999999999997s)]
*  trying to lift humanitarian assistance it takes time it's not easy and when you've got [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2463.02s)]
*  commercial cargo also coming in and therefore gars and commercial trucks being told you'll make some [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2470.86s)]
*  money if you get there early and you'll make some money if you can lift come to lift cargo [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2476.94s)]
*  they don't follow a notification process they don't follow a coordination process they arrive [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2483.1s)]
*  as early as they can and into what is an extremely again congested it's you'll always [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2489.58s)]
*  hear this term in garson because there's so many people inside of space an extremely congested route [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2496.7s)]
*  and it's the only route to get to the rafa crossing to get to kind of abosel and kind of shalom [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2502.94s)]
*  across the philadelphia corridor the philadelphia corridor is also a very dangerous place [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2510.86s)]
*  but if you have 200 trucks empty trucks parked there to get your aid trucks past them is almost [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2516.06s)]
*  if not completely impossible and you have to wait until those trucks have moved on move forward and [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2523.26s)]
*  gone in before you can get in that's the issue of the prioritization the aid has not necessarily [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2529.5s)]
*  been able to come out in sufficient numbers because it's difficult where we're working the [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2536.46s)]
*  process is difficult to follow albeit necessary but our our ability to access is extraordinarily [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2542.94s)]
*  difficult in this current scenario it's not because we don't have enough trucks it's not [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2552.54s)]
*  because we don't know how to do it and it's not because we can't get the commodities to warehouses [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2558.46s)]
*  and ultimately then distribute we have partners that can do it but this this area of of work has [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2563.42s)]
*  been very complicated since the incursion started i'm hopeful that we can improve this and whether [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2571.18s)]
*  it's based on on daily scheduling or or hours of the day which are dedicated to one form or another [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2580.62s)]
*  we don't want to see the commercial cargo stop that's not the point we need to have the appropriate [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2587.58s)]
*  mixture of free unconditional humanitarian assistance coming in as well as the appropriate forms [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2593.3399999999997s)]
*  of commercially available goods including fresh food for example vegetables that people should [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2601.1s)]
*  be able to find and we want them to be able to find but it needs to be a better managed system [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2605.8199999999997s)]
*  that it's been so far thank you matt one last question we'll go to the screen again with alice [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2611.18s)]
*  from afp please go ahead hi sorry um thanks very much for this um i'm just uh you answered my first [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2616.7799999999997s)]
*  question so i just have a short one at the end um who said yesterday told french television that [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2628.94s)]
*  civilians in gaza were getting 3200 calories a day which was he said significantly more than [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2637.02s)]
*  the base level i just wondered what you would make of that assertion um look [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2643.58s)]
*  there's i i haven't seen anybody um aid workers alike who live off protein bars [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2651.58s)]
*  eat 3000 calories or more in gaza so i'm not sure where that comes from i'm assuming it comes [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2657.5800000000004s)]
*  probably from a calculation of the number of goods going in and times the calories divided by the [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2664.6200000000003s)]
*  people which unfortunately doesn't take into consideration both the food the accessibility [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2671.42s)]
*  and the availability issues whether that food actually gets to the people that really need it [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2678.46s)]
*  whether people that really need it can even afford it um that's a question we know on the [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2683.7400000000002s)]
*  aid side not enough free unconditional forms of assistance are going in that's why that that [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2689.6600000000003s)]
*  ratio has to change um and we also know that other things need to change too we need to have [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2698.1400000000003s)]
*  more fuel going in so so all of the basic services that are needed the hospitals can run the [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2704.86s)]
*  generators run there's electricity there's communications um so on so forth that needs [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2710.46s)]
*  to change and then we can start to look at whether or not people are getting the calories they need [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2716.06s)]
*  but um we will we will see the analysis and the data that will come out in two or three weeks time [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2722.06s)]
*  when the the integrated phase classification is finalized and what is an extraordinarily robust [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2729.82s)]
*  and international form of of peer review is complete to see what is the current level [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2737.58s)]
*  with all of the environmental changes that have happened some for the better [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2744.46s)]
*  some for the much worse over the past few months matt um i know you're in a hurry and you need to [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2748.62s)]
*  go but do you have patience for one more question okay sure uh christian aljazeera thank you i i [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2755.58s)]
*  christian from aljazeera i also wanted to ask there's also accusations of hamas looting and [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2762.46s)]
*  hoarding supplies do you have any experience with that [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2769.58s)]
*  um i think it's no it's certainly no secret and we try to be um extraordinarily transparent [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2777.5s)]
*  on the issues we've we've faced when it comes to law and order and criminality in this environment [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2785.5s)]
*  without question partially driven by desperation because the situation is so desperate and some [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2795.5s)]
*  people have resorted to stealing humanitarian assistance and that does happen we've also seen [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2802.14s)]
*  some criminal gangs expand their territory and their control in areas because law and order is [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2811.74s)]
*  failing as there is a vacuum in in in in what was the the de facto's administration of the of the [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2820.4599999999996s)]
*  strip and we have we have not seen um hamas or the de facto authority taking assistance from [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2829.9799999999996s)]
*  the world food program or other un organizations what we have seen though is is that criminality in [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2841.02s)]
*  areas but we are working extraordinarily hard to engage with communities to help us prevent it [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2849.74s)]
*  and to also look at changing our routes changing our our schedules changing our [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2858.54s)]
*  um our delivery timings um for for distributions and to manage the distributions differently [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2865.74s)]
*  themselves to mitigate that but it is an extraordinarily difficult working environment [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2871.8999999999996s)]
*  for humanitarians today um but as i said at this at this juncture we've not faced that ourselves [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2878.14s)]
*  with our cargo with our humanitarian assistance that's not to say it hasn't happened um but we are [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2887.02s)]
*  we are very very careful ensuring that when something does go wrong we make it clear and [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2894.06s)]
*  public because we want to ensure that there is trust and that would include if anything was taken [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2902.06s)]
*  for for any other reason but hunger or or perhaps criminality thank you so much [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElFWvawzP0&t=2909.5s)]
