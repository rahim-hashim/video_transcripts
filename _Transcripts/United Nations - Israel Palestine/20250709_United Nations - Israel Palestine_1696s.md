DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL 
The Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, is in Yaoundé, Cameroon, where she is attending the International Conference on the Blue Economy in the Gulf of Guinea. She is doing that on behalf of the Secretary-General.  
Speaking at the opening ceremony, she highlighted the vast potential of the Blue Economy in the region, stressing the importance of protecting the ocean, unlocking its economic power, and ensuring maritime security to deliver benefits for people. She also underscored that the Blue Economy is not only central to SDG 14 — which as you all know is Life Below Water — but is also a powerful enabler of the entire 2030 Agenda and the African Union’s Agenda 2063. 
During her visit, the Deputy Secretary-General also held bilateral meetings with senior government officials, including the Prime Minister of Cameroon, Joseph Dion Ngute.  
They discussed regional challenges, strengthening the cooperation between Cameroon and the United Nations, and accelerating progress on the Sustainable Development Goals.  
YEMEN 
Hans Grundberg, our Special Envoy for Yemen, briefed the Security Council today and expressed his grave concern at the escalation in the Red Sea with attacks on two commercial ships earlier this week by Ansar Allah that resulted in civilian loss of life and casualties as well as the potential for environmental damage to the Red Sea. 
He said that freedom of navigation in the Red Sea must be safeguarded, and civilian infrastructure must never become a target in conflict. Above all, he warned, Yemen must not be drawn deeper into regional crises that threaten to unravel the already extremely fragile situation in the country. 
Mr. Grundberg reiterated his call for the unconditional and immediate release by Ansar Allah of all those who are arbitrarily detained from the United Nations, national and international NGOs, civil society organizations, as well as diplomatic missions in Yemen.
For his part, Tom Fletcher, our Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, also briefed the Council and he told the fifteen members that the food security crisis in Yemen has been steadily accelerating since late 2023. Today, he said, more than 17 million people in Yemen are going hungry and that number could climb to over 18 million by September. He called for increased funding now to scale up emergency food and nutrition support for all those who need it.  
SUDAN 
Turning to the situation in Sudan, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that the situation in North Darfur State remains alarming, as fighting continues to drive families from their homes. 
Yesterday, shelling reportedly hit the market area inside the Abu Shouk camp, killing three civilians and injuring many more. As a reminder, this is a displacement camp where famine was confirmed last year. This tragic incident is another reminder of the toll this conflict is taking on civilians. 
Prior to yesterday’s incident, the International Organization for Migration reports that more than 3,200 people had fled Abu Shouk camp and parts of El Fasher between June 26th and July 6th, and that they were seeking safety in places like As Serief, Tawila and At Tina. 
In the Kordofan region, the humanitarian situation is also deteriorating.                                           
Ongoing violence is forcing more people to flee, often into areas with little or no assistance. IOM says that on July 5th, nearly 800 people were displaced from Bara, in North Kordofan State, and are now sheltering in White Nile State. 
Despite the challenges, our humanitarian partners are doing everything they can to keep services running. In North Darfur, they are supporting over 1.7 million human beings with basic healthcare, using both remaining health facilities and mobile clinics. However, medical supplies are running critically low. 
We and our partners are rushing assistance to the Darfur region.  
A humanitarian convoy that crossed into Darfur from Chad on July 6th – and that convoy was led by our Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator, Antoine Gerard – is carrying 180 metric tonnes of life-saving relief items for almost 400,000 conflict-affected and displaced people both in the East and South Darfur states. 
Meanwhile, flash flooding threatens to make it more difficult for humanitarians to reach people in need. Today in eastern Sudan, heavy rains triggered flash floods in the Northern Delta locality of Kassala State. This comes as authorities began releasing water from several major dams to manage rising floodwaters. OCHA is closely monitoring the situation and will provide updates as they come in.

*  The shortage of medical and cleaning supplies is severe health repercussions and impedes [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=555.04s)]
*  a proper response. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=559.48s)]
*  We are calling for the entry into Gaza of hygiene kits, cleaning supplies. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=562.56s)]
*  Just as a reminder, since early March, no hygiene items have entered. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=568.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, humanitarian movement inside Gaza remained limited. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=573.56s)]
*  Yesterday, out of 10 attempts to coordinate movements with the Israeli authorities, only [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=578.3199999999999s)]
*  three were fully facilitated for the collection of medical supplies and the removal of debris. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=583.44s)]
*  Another three attempts were denied outright, including one to collect the supplies from [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=588.6800000000001s)]
*  Kareem Shalom Crossing. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=592.76s)]
*  The remaining four had to be canceled by the organizers. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  From Syria, they can tell you that our humanitarian operations along with our partners are continuing [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=599.04s)]
*  to support the response led by the national and local authorities to the wildfires which [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=606.9s)]
*  are continuing to spread in the country's coastal areas. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=611.92s)]
*  UNICEF and its partners have deployed mobile teams, including healthcare and nutrition [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=616.04s)]
*  support to children under the age of five. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=620.28s)]
*  It is also, along with the UN population fund, offering psychosocial support and distributing [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=622.52s)]
*  dignity kits to women, girls and children. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=628.52s)]
*  We also have distributed solar lamps, jerry cans and buckets in the provinces of Latakia. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=631.2s)]
*  Local authorities report that over 14,000 hectares of agricultural land have been burnt, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=636.88s)]
*  directly impacting more than 5,000 people. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=642.52s)]
*  Thousands have fled to high-risk zones, resulting in the need for shelter, clean water and basic [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=645.68s)]
*  services, as people seek safety. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=650.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, a bit of good news from Ocha. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=653.56s)]
*  They tell us that on Monday, the Syrian Arab Republic extended its consent for the UN to [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=658.76s)]
*  deliver humanitarian assistance through three crossings for another six months. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  Those crossings are Bab al-Hawa, Bab al-Salam and Al-Rai. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=672.8s)]
*  That will take us up to early February of 2026. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=678.4399999999999s)]
*  This remains an important and cost-effective route for the delivery of humanitarian assistance, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=683.68s)]
*  which is now being used to provide assistance to a range of areas inside Syria. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=688.4399999999999s)]
*  This year, more than 1,500 trucks have delivered critical assistance through these routes, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=693.12s)]
*  which is more than five times the number of the same period last year. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=697.52s)]
*  Lastly, turning to Ethiopia, Tom Fletcher, Emergency Relief Coordinator, today allocated [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=702.12s)]
*  three million U.S. dollars from the Central Emergency Response Fund to provide life-saving [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=707.88s)]
*  assistance to South Sudanese refugees arriving in the Gambela region in the western part [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=712.44s)]
*  of the country. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=718.04s)]
*  At least 35,000 people fleeing escalating violence in South Sudan have crossed the border [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=719.12s)]
*  into Ethiopia's Gambela region. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=724.8399999999999s)]
*  This influx is stretching already limited resources and refugees face extremely difficult [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=727.14s)]
*  conditions without access to adequate food, shelter and other basic services. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=733.52s)]
*  The new funding from the Central Emergency Response Fund will support both refugees and [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=740.76s)]
*  the communities that are generously hosting them. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=745.92s)]
*  They will also be prioritizing food, protection, shelter, clean water, sanitation, health, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=748.84s)]
*  and other critical support for vulnerable groups, including women and children, who [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=754.1600000000001s)]
*  have yet to receive any assistance. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=758.52s)]
*  On that note, Deji Dhanidi. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=761.6s)]
*  Any response from the Secretary General on the Israeli Defense Minister, Qatar's idea [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=765.4s)]
*  of a so-called humanitarian city on the ruin of Gaza City to concentrate all Gaza population? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=773.6s)]
*  We have, it's not the first time we've heard of such projects. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=780.6s)]
*  We firmly stand against any forced displacement of people that would only increase risks to [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=785.76s)]
*  themselves. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=793.12s)]
*  But if they decide to do that, what can stop them from doing that? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=794.36s)]
*  I think that's a question you can probably answer yourself. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=798.96s)]
*  Edi. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=801.76s)]
*  Thank you, Steph. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=804.76s)]
*  We've been hearing probably every day for the last two weeks about fuel shortages in [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=806.88s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=813.3599999999999s)]
*  What is the Israeli government's explanation to the United Nations of why it is barring [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=815.4599999999999s)]
*  any fuel trucks from going into Gaza? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=823.12s)]
*  Well, I can tell you that the UN and our operations needs hundreds of thousands of liters of fuel [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=826.24s)]
*  every day to keep things going. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=834.08s)]
*  We are at a very low point. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=836.52s)]
*  I don't want to say any more on fuel right now because we may have some updates for you [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=839.36s)]
*  later today. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=844.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=845.5600000000001s)]
*  Does the Secretary General have any comment on Russia's largest bombardment in Ukraine [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=847.16s)]
*  of this war, which I believe was overnight? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=857.52s)]
*  Like we said earlier over the weekend, we continue to condemn these attacks and attacks [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=862.4799999999999s)]
*  on civilian infrastructure. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=868.9599999999999s)]
*  We want to see an end to this war. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=871.8399999999999s)]
*  Michelle, then Abdulhamid, then Benny. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=875.84s)]
*  Sorry on fuel in Gaza. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=878.84s)]
*  We've heard a lot for a long time now that you're down to low reserves. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=882.32s)]
*  Any sort of days? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=886.72s)]
*  Again, I don't want to say, let me, two things. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=888.76s)]
*  One, I do not want to say anything more on fuel because we may have an update later today. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=894.36s)]
*  It is very hard to tell you how many days we have left because every day that the fuel [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=899.18s)]
*  reserves get lower, the more we stretch. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=908.0999999999999s)]
*  At some point, like when you stretch a rubber band, things will break. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=912.8599999999999s)]
*  But as I said again, I would hope to have an update on fuel today. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=917.02s)]
*  Have you engaged the services of any other countries to help with this? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=920.3s)]
*  We've constantly engaged with many countries to help use their influence to ease the humanitarian [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=924.3000000000001s)]
*  situation in Gaza. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=931.86s)]
*  Abdulhamid, then Benny. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=934.0600000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Steph. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=936.6600000000001s)]
*  In the West Bank, at least three refugee camps completely being destroyed day in and day [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=939.1s)]
*  out, Tul Kerim and Ayn Shams and Jenin and the Israeli pledging that they will open the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=944.7s)]
*  area and not allow refugee camps to be there. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=954.38s)]
*  So do you have any comment? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=960.1400000000001s)]
*  I think we've been extremely clear and transparent at expressing our deep, deep concern at the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=961.4200000000001s)]
*  worsening situation in the occupied West Bank for Palestinian civilians, not only in [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=969.74s)]
*  the face of government action but in the face of settler action. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=976.46s)]
*  And our colleagues at OCHA report either once or twice a week on the situation. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=979.62s)]
*  We'll continue to do so. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=984.1800000000001s)]
*  When the settlers attack a Palestinian village, destroy their trees and fields and steal their [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=987.1s)]
*  goats, do the villagers, do the population of this village have the right to resist? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=993.86s)]
*  Look, people have a right anywhere in the world to self-defense. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1000.5799999999999s)]
*  We want to see an end to this violence. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1007.4599999999999s)]
*  Benny, and then Pam. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1010.14s)]
*  So to paraphrase Rodney King, why can't we all get along? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1012.98s)]
*  UN aid on one hand, GHF on the other. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1019.06s)]
*  Why is the UN so anti-GHF? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1027.46s)]
*  We're not anti-GHF, Benny. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1031.46s)]
*  We are. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1033.46s)]
*  No, no. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1034.46s)]
*  You've asked me a question. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1035.46s)]
*  Let me. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1036.46s)]
*  If you, that was a question mark. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1037.46s)]
*  If that was a question mark and you pause, so let me take this opportunity, let me be [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1039.62s)]
*  opportunistic and try to answer your question. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1042.94s)]
*  We are not anti-GHF, right? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1047.3799999999999s)]
*  We are for humanitarian aid. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1049.86s)]
*  We've said it over and over again. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1052.78s)]
*  The UN alone cannot handle the humanitarian needs. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1055.58s)]
*  We want to be able to do our work to full capacity, which is not something we've been [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1058.8999999999999s)]
*  allowed to do. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1064.74s)]
*  We ask others who are doing humanitarian aid or who are trying to do humanitarian aid or [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1066.98s)]
*  who are doing, frankly, one could describe just food distribution, to do it in a way [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1073.4199999999998s)]
*  that doesn't put at risk the people they're trying to help. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1079.66s)]
*  There are basic principles that are adopted by the General Assembly that are globally [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1085.54s)]
*  accepted by the humanitarian community of impartiality, of independence, of neutrality [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1091.3s)]
*  and of humanity. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1099.5s)]
*  We will not work with people who do not meet those standards, right? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1101.7s)]
*  Now, if the GHF or any other group wants to work in a way that meets those standards, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1106.5400000000002s)]
*  we will cooperate with any of them fully, and we've been very clear on that. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1114.3400000000001s)]
*  Lazzarini, who heads a UN agency, calls to dismantle the GHF. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1118.3400000000001s)]
*  So does Hamas. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1127.22s)]
*  Why are you on the same side? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1128.22s)]
*  We are on the side of helping people in a way that does not get them killed. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1130.92s)]
*  Pam. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1136.52s)]
*  Wait, so wait. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1137.52s)]
*  I still don't understand. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1138.52s)]
*  UNRWA is the largest UN agency and it calls to dismantle GHF. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1140.0800000000002s)]
*  Does the Secretary General also call to dismantle? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1150.5600000000002s)]
*  The message, I think, from UNRWA to the GHF is for them to conduct their work with the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1152.8400000000001s)]
*  standards that is acceptable to all. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1159.92s)]
*  That was not the message in the statement that they put out, which said dismantle the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1162.88s)]
*  GHF. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1168.24s)]
*  I've answered the question to the best of my limited ability. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1169.24s)]
*  Pam. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1172.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1173.92s)]

*  about Black Sea Grain Initiative and is the mechanism still in place in Istanbul? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1211.04s)]

*  We're focusing on the humanitarian situation. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1285.1999999999998s)]
*  But you have so many people there. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1286.6799999999998s)]
*  They must see what's going on. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1288.72s)]

*  They seem to be running a food distribution system that is putting that while some people [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1336.44s)]
*  are getting food, people are also getting killed, trying to get that food. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1342.08s)]
*  That's not a way we would run a humanitarian operation. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1347.28s)]

*  I mean, we'll try to get that. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1369.3999999999999s)]
*  We'll try to get those more granular details for you. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1371.72s)]
*  Deji then Abdu'Hameed. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1374.44s)]
*  That's not your prerogative. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1376.44s)]
*  We're not in a legislative chamber. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1381.44s)]
*  No, since we're talking about this Gaza humanitarian fund, I remember you just said in the beginning [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1385.44s)]
*  of this whole operation, it's not meet the standards of the UN humanitarian operations. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1393.72s)]
*  Is that the reason you would describe that this all the incident happened during their [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1401.44s)]
*  close to their distribution site? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1409.16s)]
*  When you're running a militarized food distribution, when you're forcing people into barbed wire [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1411.3600000000001s)]
*  lined corridors, when you're pushing them to be near military checkpoints, it's a recipe [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1418.0800000000002s)]
*  for what is what is happening. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1427.04s)]
*  Last week, I believe it's more than 140 NGOs, very important NGOs, they demanded to dismantle [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1429.32s)]
*  Gaza humanitarian fund. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1438.36s)]

*  We've been very clear and critical of the way they operate. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1447.9199999999998s)]
*  We want them and we want anyone who distributes aid in Gaza to operate along the basic humanitarian [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1452.8s)]
*  principles which are enshrined in general assembly resolutions, which I'm happy to read [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1461.4s)]
*  again for you, which are humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1467.76s)]
*  Speaking of all four of those, Abdu'Hameed. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1475.24s)]
*  Thank you, two questions. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1477.56s)]
*  In Lebanon, South Lebanon, Israeli did not stop attacking South Lebanon in the last few [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1479.3200000000002s)]
*  days, almost every single day. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  And I ask why these attacks do not show in your daily briefing? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1486.8000000000002s)]
*  Listen, our peacekeepers today are telling us that IDF presence and activities north [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1494.0s)]
*  of the blue line, again, they urge them and all the parties to respect 1701. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1501.18s)]
*  We've been reporting on it. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1507.52s)]
*  I mean, I think I reported on it twice last week. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1508.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1512.28s)]
*  My second question, WHO said that children in Gaza under five years old are dying 10 [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1513.28s)]
*  times more than before October 23. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1521.1599999999999s)]
*  And children under one month are dying six times more than before 2023. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1524.48s)]
*  Are these considers first part of the tally of the numbers people killed in Gaza? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1532.0s)]
*  Do we add these children killed? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1538.44s)]
*  I think the numbers that are being released by the Gaza Ministry of Health include people [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1540.8s)]
*  who are dead. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1550.56s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a question you need to ask the people who are collating the numbers. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1552.1599999999999s)]
*  Linda, then Benny. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1556.24s)]
*  Thank you, Steph. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1559.3999999999999s)]
*  Apropos of the four principles of distribution of humanitarian aid, I mean, I might just [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1560.8000000000002s)]
*  be dense, but does this mean that ID is not required by participants or ID is required? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1568.72s)]
*  In other words, for example, in Gaza, Sudan, et cetera, in countries where there are wars [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1578.88s)]
*  going on, does this mean that the soldiers could be getting aid, humanitarian aid? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1584.4s)]
*  We need to do it in a way that meets the four criteria that I've read out, where people [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1590.84s)]
*  who are desperate for food, people who need food, get it in a way that is organized, that [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1598.28s)]
*  recognizes their humanity. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1604.24s)]
*  And that's the way we work all over the world. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1606.64s)]
*  Benny. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1609.68s)]
*  Just, I still don't understand some of these principles that you said, neutrality, for [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1610.68s)]
*  instance, what does that mean in the sense of 66 million food packages distributed? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1619.0400000000002s)]
*  Are they distributed not neutrally? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1627.8400000000001s)]
*  What's the? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1630.96s)]
*  What I'm saying is that a food distribution system where people routinely, routinely get [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1632.5200000000002s)]
*  killed while trying to get the food is not a humanitarian operation. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1640.24s)]
*  And impartiality, I mean, there are a lot of allegations that Hamas does confiscate [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1646.44s)]
*  UN-distributed aid. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1653.3999999999999s)]
*  Is that impartial? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1656.92s)]
*  Or partial? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1659.6399999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1660.6399999999999s)]
*  We, the main work of our humanitarian operation in Gaza, when we're actually allowed to do [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1661.6399999999999s)]
*  it, gives food to individual families. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1668.36s)]
*  We will continue to advocate to operate in that way. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1674.4399999999998s)]
*  Is the Gaza humanitarian forum way of working full proof? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1678.84s)]
*  I think that's a question they may have to answer themselves. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1682.8799999999999s)]
*  Is there confiscation of Hamas people by Hamas people? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oakUfqPvDo&t=1685.3999999999999s)]
