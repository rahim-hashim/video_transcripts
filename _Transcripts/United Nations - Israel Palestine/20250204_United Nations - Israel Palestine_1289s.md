Video Description: Two former combatants on opposing sides of the decades-old conflict between Palestinians and Israel have come to together to discuss how Israeli Jews and Palestinians can live side by side in peace. Given the brutality of the recent conflict in Gaza between Hamas and Israel, it has become increasingly difficult to imagine a durable peace. Yet, that remains the aim of a remarkable grassroots organization called Combatants for Peace.
 
The organization, which has been nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes, is made up of Israelis and Palestinians who once embraced violence but have since turned to peace and dialogue as the only solution to healing the wounds of both communities.

# A Dialogue between Palestinian and Israeli Former Combatants | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4)
*  For over a year international headlines have been dominated by the bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=0.0s)]
*  Which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=6.86s)]
*  The military action was a response to the Hamas attack on Israel on the 7th of October 2023 [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=10.38s)]
*  Which resulted in the death of over a thousand Israelis [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=16.18s)]
*  After so much killing and devastation. It's hard to imagine Israelis and Palestinians living side-by-side in peace [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=20.18s)]
*  Yet that remains the aim of a remarkable grassroots organization called combatants for peace [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=28.12s)]
*  Which has been nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes over the years [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=33.5s)]
*  As the name suggests it's made up of Israelis and Palestinians who decided that violence was not going to lead to a solution to their grievances [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=37.74s)]
*  Several of the members were invited to UN headquarters by the UN Office of rule and law and security [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=46.34s)]
*  Institutions at the end of January 2025 and I'm pleased to welcome two of those confidence to the UN studios [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=52.54s)]
*  Thank you very much for being here. I'll start with you may this is a my Shaheen a Palestinian peace activist and therapist with [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  over 12 years of experience on conflict resolution and Alik al-hanan [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=65.84s)]
*  Who once served in a special forces unit in the Israeli Defense Forces in the 1990s? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=70.8s)]
*  And then after that you began to refuse to take part in military action in the early [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=76.25999999999999s)]
*  2000s now [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=81.66s)]
*  Obviously here at UN news. We've been following what's happening in Gaza every day [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=83.58s)]
*  The impression one gets if you're following this through the media is that there is to gulf between the two sides [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=88.94s)]
*  between the Israeli and the Palestinian populations that that no dialogue is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=96.7s)]
*  Possible and it feels a bit extraordinary. Maybe it shouldn't to see you both here sitting side-by-side [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=101.94s)]
*  For you is this extraordinary or does it feel unnatural to be talking to each other in this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=108.7s)]
*  Relaxed environment without any conflict [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't know if there is no conflict because there is no no way to create an absence of one [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=119.7s)]
*  But we are together even though there might be disagreements. There might be conflicts [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=125.86s)]
*  we this is actually our partnership and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=131.54s)]
*  solving and ending the occupation [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=134.94s)]
*  so to me now after many many years it is very usual and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=137.82s)]
*  Normal to be sitting with another another human being who happens to also be an Israeli Jewish. So [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=143.66s)]
*  Yeah, and see you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=150.82s)]
*  I'm in combatants for peace have been around for a while we [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=153.94s)]
*  October 7th and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=158.33999999999997s)]
*  subsequent violence [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=160.94s)]
*  Crimes against humanity in Gaza tested our metal, but it wasn't our first and test of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=163.26s)]
*  the sort we've been doing this since [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=170.18s)]
*  2005 trying to find a way to communicate and dialogue as [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=173.42s)]
*  May said there is no absence of conflict, but we try to live with it and around it and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=177.06s)]
*  And I have to say over the years in the last [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=183.3s)]
*  20 years, this is my community. These are my brothers and sisters [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  These are my peers. These are the people I go to when I need advice and [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  These are the people I go to when I need the support I trust me and I trust all the other Palestinian members [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=197.26000000000002s)]
*  Without a doubt in a certain sense, I mean even though we have this horizon [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=207.06s)]
*  The immediate result of [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  Our [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=216.17999999999998s)]
*  Work is how should I say not less pain but more pain because now we're grieving for two [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=217.42s)]
*  communities and fighting for two communities and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  As a result of our long long engagement together. This was the most natural [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=226.26s)]
*  As you say this engagement has been going on for a long time, but over the last 15 16 months in particular [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=232.42s)]
*  What are the conversations been like between different communities within competence for peaks? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=238.26s)]
*  For us it was very very clear on the seventh starting even on the seventh of October that now more than ever [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=243.3s)]
*  We have to meet it is normal to meet when everything is peaceful [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  When for us Palestinian for the Israelis when it was done on us Palestinians, you know [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=255.82000000000002s)]
*  Like many words have been in happened in Gaza many many many things [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=260.90000000000003s)]
*  Haven't in the West Bank and still as combatants in peace as Palestinians [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=265.82s)]
*  We woke up every day and we went to meet with our Israelis as he said brothers and sisters and also partner [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=269.86s)]
*  partners into into bringing into bringing a change and indeed it did [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=277.22s)]
*  All the work of the organization of so many years of building came actually to prove itself on the seventh of October [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=282.86s)]
*  When we communicated with each other we started writing by messages. You will see also in the film. There is another way [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=290.38s)]
*  Of how it went through with Jamil and Ken [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=297.54s)]
*  two of the main [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=301.62s)]
*  holders of the combatants for peace and a few days later we met and we started talking on how can we actually bring [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=303.62s)]
*  Everything we have learned and everything we have worked for all through this years now [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=312.26000000000005s)]
*  While is this is happening while is the seventh of October that followed a genocide? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=317.94s)]
*  That followed a genocide immediately and how do we actually walk our talk now in the front of the Israeli and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=322.98s)]
*  Palestinian community [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=330.94s)]
*  so a lot of conversations a lot of meeting a lot of a grieving a lot of a crying a lot of a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=332.54s)]
*  lot of conversations dialogue nonviolent [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=339.18s)]
*  Dialogue has been one of the most crucial [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=342.62s)]
*  Strategies that we have been using in combatants for peace which allows us all the time to not only talks and talk about politics [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=346.42s)]
*  But to actually connect deeply with each other and to allow the pain and the grieving to come [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=353.38s)]
*  We have as Palestinians we hold the space for the Israeli activists [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=359.82s)]
*  That came that were going from one funeral to another a funeral and that lost a lot of their friends and the friends of their [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=364.62s)]
*  children that were at the Nova and other [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=371.54s)]
*  Festivals there and and they needed to come with that frustration and anger and pain and grief and we understood [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=374.38s)]
*  Now this is the time to also hold these conversations and and be in that degree in order to be able to continue [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=380.74s)]
*  working and creating a much bigger actually effect within the movement movement and to also show our [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=388.22s)]
*  communities that nonviolent resistance is actually the only way for both of us to live on equal and just [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=395.3s)]
*  one land for everybody [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=403.58000000000004s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=405.5s)]
*  I don't have much to add to what may said I was here during the events of October 7th [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=408.70000000000005s)]
*  And as I said during those days [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=414.70000000000005s)]
*  I was terrified for both communities. My family comes from the kibbutzim in the south. I [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=420.62s)]
*  Know people in Gaza many of our members have families and friends in Gaza [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=426.22s)]
*  Going through the fear of October 7th and the anticipation to the Israeli reprisals that we knew would be insane and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=433.54s)]
*  disproportionate and criminal [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=441.70000000000005s)]
*  was terrible and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  I can say that in this time I was [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=446.98s)]
*  Holding on [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=451.86s)]
*  To one hope and this is the combatants for peace will survive this that the conversation will begin as I said [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  This is not our first one first [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=460.34000000000003s)]
*  Event like that. It's the worst but it's not the first and there were many moments where we thought that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=462.94s)]
*  The organization will not survive this level of atrocities and each time it was the ability of members from [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=468.26s)]
*  Usually the Palestinian side to rent to stretch ahead and give us a place [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=474.38s)]
*  To be with them and to feel human that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=481.34s)]
*  Saved the movement and it happened again in October 7th and in a certain sense in this darkest of moments a sliver of hope [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=484.65999999999997s)]
*  Remains as I said, I was not part of this particular conversation on the ground [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=491.62s)]
*  but I followed it with a bated breath and I'm so grateful that we [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=496.42s)]
*  Survived this moment and that we are still here and giving some sort of horizon [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=501.90000000000003s)]
*  I will add again on a personal note. I lost my sister in 1997 to a Hamas suicide bombing [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=506.66s)]
*  I am familiar with this side of the conflict as I am familiar with being the aggressor of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=512.9200000000001s)]
*  This conflict a place of forgiveness for my actions and a place for my grief was never found for me in the Israeli society [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=519.18s)]
*  however, my Palestinian friends in combatants for peace were able to give me this space and the fear of losing it was [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=526.38s)]
*  The worst fear I've ever experienced and the joy that it's still around is [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=533.54s)]
*  Definitely what gives me hope in the everyday. Can you remember when you decided that violence? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=538.3399999999999s)]
*  Was not the answer as I said he used to be part of the Israeli Special Forces [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=544.5s)]
*  Violence was a part of what you were doing for both of you and may as well you were involved in the first intervata [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=548.5s)]
*  What was that the second father? Excuse me. Do you remember what what changed was there a specific moment that changed? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=555.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean not a specific series of moment [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=562.54s)]
*  It takes time political transformation takes time and takes a great deal of patience [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=565.54s)]
*  There's a lot of pangs along the way [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=570.4200000000001s)]
*  but I mean the first moment was here after the death after the murder of my sister when I mean in the midst of all the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=572.46s)]
*  rage and pain and [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=578.86s)]
*  my [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=581.62s)]
*  Members from the army from my unit my commanding officer [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=583.02s)]
*  visited me and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=586.74s)]
*  They didn't have anything to say any vision except more deaths more killing and I remember very clearly [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=588.38s)]
*  officers from my unit telling me and [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=595.94s)]
*  You know your home now they need you but get over it quickly come back to the unit you'll feel like a whole person again [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=599.02s)]
*  We are we are going out to Lebanon [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=605.14s)]
*  You'll get even now like the people who killed my sister came our Palestinians from the area of Nablus [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=607.18s)]
*  How does fighting his Bala in Lebanon is going to alleviate my pain or in a certain sense? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=613.38s)]
*  Redeemed the death of my sister. What is the connection and this vision of a world a [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=618.98s)]
*  Completely dominated by senseless violence [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=623.62s)]
*  Transact transactional violence depressed me more than I can explain now [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=627.18s)]
*  I was in this kind of violent and angry sort of depression for many many many years until [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=631.5s)]
*  during the second intifada as a young student in Paris, I [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=637.62s)]
*  Met Palestinian students and we started working together. We started protesting the violence together [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=642.82s)]
*  We started insisting that the way of dialogue and negotiation of peace based on equality and justice is not [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=649.66s)]
*  Dead and it's in this moment that something opened up in me and from that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=657.18s)]
*  I mean later with combatants for peace with other forms of Israeli Palestinian resistance and solidarity actions [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=661.9s)]
*  This change received really a form and became a vision and a horizon [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=672.14s)]
*  But yeah, it took a long time [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=678.66s)]
*  So an important part of that you say was was be able to come face to face with [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=680.54s)]
*  Palestinian students to see each other as human beings the most important part by far [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=684.06s)]
*  Yeah, and I know that may you've you've said much the same thing from your side. Yeah, definitely for me. It was the same [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=689.3399999999999s)]
*  I was fortunate to first meet a community of Palestinians and Israelis 13 years ago who [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=694.9399999999999s)]
*  Had the vision and the dream that said let's come and live together and it was my [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=703.1s)]
*  First time actually meeting with normal Israelis who earn who are not military who are not [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=709.06s)]
*  Investigating me who are not the terrorizing me who are not stopping me on it chick points [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=715.78s)]
*  And I was I happened to was there translating nonviolent [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=720.98s)]
*  communication training and the co-founder of combatants for peace the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=726.18s)]
*  Sleeman al-fati was there sharing his story and it through sharing his story [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=730.38s)]
*  He started also sharing how it was for him in jail and how he came to understand that nonviolent resistance is [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=735.82s)]
*  actually the means is actually what will it bring real liberation and a freedom to [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=743.46s)]
*  to us Palestinians together also with Jewish and and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=749.62s)]
*  In one land and through his story [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=753.7s)]
*  I started reflecting my own story that well my intentions even when I chose the violent resistance was not to kill [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=756.38s)]
*  I just wanted to be free. I never I never wanted to harm anybody [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=765.98s)]
*  I never meant I didn't want to I didn't want to but seeing the enormous violence of the Israeli [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=769.98s)]
*  occupation of course [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=777.62s)]
*  I thought that the only way to actually meet such forces of power and weapon is me being also in the same [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=778.94s)]
*  reflecting the same violence on them and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=786.38s)]
*  Listening to Suley and being part of that of that community that it brought so much dialogue made me understand that wow [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=789.86s)]
*  I want to now take my back resistance into this nonviolent resistance because [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=796.66s)]
*  It is very true that it we were we were never against Jewish as [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=803.58s)]
*  Palestinians we have never had anything against the Jewish people or the Jewish nation [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=809.94s)]
*  We are against occupation we are against oppression [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=816.02s)]
*  We are against the separation wall and it's checkpoints and in the combatants. These are exactly our Israeli partners [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=819.3000000000001s)]
*  They are the ones who are saying the same they are refusing the occupation. They are refusing the oppression [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=826.4200000000001s)]
*  They are refusing what is being done on the Palestinians whether in Gaza or now in the whispering [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=832.34s)]
*  They are speaking up. They are standing up. They are being seen to out to my [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=837.46s)]
*  Palestinian community [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=842.9000000000001s)]
*  Not only in the talk but on the ground of actually bringing nonviolent [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=844.78s)]
*  Resistance in a joint work and partnership with the communities with the local communities like in the Jordan valleys [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=849.8199999999999s)]
*  Like in Lithuania like in Masafir Yatta. There is always joint work all the time [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=856.38s)]
*  So the Palestinian community gets to actually meet us kids to actually see [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=862.6999999999999s)]
*  That Alec and what he is doing and Ken and Evner and Iris Iris [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=867.3399999999999s)]
*  For example is in fire. See ya all the time [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=872.66s)]
*  You know standing all the time in between the settlers violence and the Palestinian community there and other activist [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=875.3399999999999s)]
*  Ali he's in the Jordan valleys [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=881.78s)]
*  So people get to actually see the combatants for peace in an action nonviolent resistance [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=883.62s)]
*  Movement within partnership which also gives us more legitimacy to bring ourselves [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=890.66s)]
*  And is the political class listening to you at all? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=895.86s)]
*  The political class in Israel and Palestine are they hearing your message are they listening to what you're saying? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=899.9399999999999s)]
*  We actually had a big gay solidarity campaign as they [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=905.02s)]
*  August and we were joined by members from the Knesset like offer kaseef [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=909.9s)]
*  Maryam to man and other people and we are not yet [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=915.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, the hope is to have more people within the within politics exchange makers with us [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=919.2199999999999s)]
*  This is this is the vision for our movement to actually [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=924.7s)]
*  Be in bigger partnerships with the places like here like with the UN and the bigger political change-making [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=928.3000000000001s)]
*  In our land and bringing this vision both people one land on a real just [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=934.3000000000001s)]
*  political agreement, so yeah, I [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=940.82s)]
*  Mean [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=947.5s)]
*  Completely agree with what may said it should be I should point out that the politician that support us in the Israeli system are [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=948.86s)]
*  From the very far left of the political map nearly off the political map [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=959.3399999999999s)]
*  These are the Jewish and Palestinian members of the Communist Party and the coalition around it [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=964.38s)]
*  unfortunately in the mainstream Israeli political system, we have a lot of [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=971.3399999999999s)]
*  Silent support but few of them have the courage to support us openly and vocally. What do you think that is? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=977.18s)]
*  My think a very deep misunderstanding of how politics works, but I think they judge the Israeli [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=986.62s)]
*  State of mind and temperament and think that what it needs is more unity more strength more togetherness [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=996.9s)]
*  I mean, I think they're wrong. I think what we need is a principled [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1002.9s)]
*  Opposition and we can see that in the popular reaction to our work [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1006.9s)]
*  both in Israel and in Palestine and I mean I do this is my hope that [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1012.42s)]
*  politicians both in Israel and around the world will follow will see that [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1018.26s)]
*  We have this great growth potential and will follow but for the time being [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1024.46s)]
*  That only a small minority is there openly [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1030.98s)]
*  Now of course for decades now the idea of a two-state solution an Israeli state in the past in state side by side [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1034.9s)]
*  That's been an on the cornerstones of the United Nations [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1041.9s)]
*  In the current climate, do you think this is still possible? Can it still happen? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1046.14s)]
*  For me, it's a one-state solution. I cannot think of how way to two-state or to two maybe two governments [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1052.14s)]
*  But one land solution is is the real solution that needs to come. So what would that look like? So I described that a bit [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1059.54s)]
*  Everybody living freely on one land and like it happens here in America or it happens in America in Europe as well [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1066.42s)]
*  You know, there are a Christian Jewish Muslims Buddhist [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1073.18s)]
*  Non-believers and they are all managing to live together [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1077.22s)]
*  if really respectfully and each of them has their own governmental means to go to and [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1080.1s)]
*  Religious places to to go to so for us it's like we want exactly the same [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1085.98s)]
*  We are not asking for something that is out of the box or that is we are we are as a human as [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1091.54s)]
*  The rest of the world is we can be together [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1098.22s)]
*  we are here to actually say as a movement as Palestinians and as as [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1101.1799999999998s)]
*  Jewish Israelis that we want to live together our me we are our fight is against oppression system [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1106.82s)]
*  It's against occupation. It's against the separation and the cheek points and everything that is now happening, but it is not against [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1113.74s)]
*  Jewish people it's not against living together in the contrary it is living together and [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1121.74s)]
*  To me personally my father is from the West Bank. My mom is from East Jerusalem [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1127.5800000000002s)]
*  The separation wall is separating my own family. My daughter has the Israeli citizenship [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1132.66s)]
*  I have the Palestinian citizenship. We are still separated by what is happening now [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1138.22s)]
*  When we started combatants for peace the position [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1144.66s)]
*  I mean [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1147.3s)]
*  This was also the PLO's position and the position of many of the Israeli members was a very staunch two-state [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1147.98s)]
*  Solution according to the UN resolutions [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1153.98s)]
*  Etc, but I have to say this was 20 years ago and the US resolutions were nearly 50 years ago and reality [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1157.02s)]
*  changes and perspective [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1164.82s)]
*  Changes and one of the missions that we didn't set to ourselves [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1166.6200000000001s)]
*  But we realized that we were doing in combatants for peace was building a joint political language for Israelis and Palestinians [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1170.62s)]
*  To function together in a single political system and I have to say this experience changed me [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1177.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't know if the two-state solution is still possible. I don't know if it's desirable [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1182.6999999999998s)]
*  I like sharing my political [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1186.9399999999998s)]
*  landscape with Palestinians with their experience and their intelligence and their particular understanding of [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1190.1399999999999s)]
*  history and politics [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1195.3799999999999s)]
*  However, and this was a key point in combatants from peace since the beginning [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1197.22s)]
*  We don't presume to be a shadow government or something like that [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1200.78s)]
*  We don't have a position paper on what should be the result. There are people who this is their job [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1204.18s)]
*  I think they're in this building. There are people that this is their expertise any problem can have a solution [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1210.94s)]
*  We are here to say that the way to get there is through negotiation is through a greed upon [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1217.8600000000001s)]
*  Peace process and not through violence and war and ethnic cleansing and genocide and [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1224.94s)]
*  Whichever solution will be agreed upon and will be voted upon and will be accepted by the majority of the populations that [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1230.9s)]
*  we're fine with [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1237.78s)]
*  Our personal preferences, you know, we're in dialogue and they change they grow [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1239.46s)]
*  There were one thing 20 years ago [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1245.78s)]
*  Today there's a very idea girl getting currency of one land to states [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1247.78s)]
*  I don't know what has the political acumen to [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1256.98s)]
*  materialize right now, but I think we need to try we need to push we need to [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1260.54s)]
*  Anything is better than what's going on now the lack of hope that we see now [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1265.54s)]
*  May elic thank you so much for being with us today [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mrROtHtIH4&t=1270.06s)]
