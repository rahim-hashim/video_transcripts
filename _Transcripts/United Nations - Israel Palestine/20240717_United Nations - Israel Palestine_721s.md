# UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory on Gaza and West Bank - Stakeout
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc)
*  I thought you wanted to say something first. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=0.0s)]
*  That's why I was giving you space. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=2.0s)]
*  We're delighted to be joined by Mohannad Hadi, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=4.0s)]
*  who as you know is the humanitarian coordinator [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=7.0s)]
*  for the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=9.0s)]
*  I think you've heard a lot of speeches today, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=12.0s)]
*  so I think we're just going to go to questions. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=14.0s)]
*  Hit us up. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=17.0s)]
*  Hi, my name is Hizam. I'm from the Arab world. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=19.0s)]
*  My name is Hizam. I'm from the Arab world. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=22.0s)]
*  I'm from the Arab world. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=24.0s)]
*  First, I have two questions. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=26.0s)]
*  The first one about the Gaza, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=30.0s)]
*  and what do you see as the biggest challenge [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=33.0s)]
*  that you're facing there regarding bringing this aid into Gaza? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=36.0s)]
*  And the second question is about the West Bank and Jerusalem [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=44.0s)]
*  and the settler violence. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=50.0s)]
*  In Jerusalem, they say horrible bad, and how, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=53.0s)]
*  but it's the bad violence in the also affecting the U.S. world [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=57.0s)]
*  and here we think there is a very big issue there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=61.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=64.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=65.0s)]
*  In Gaza, there are a set of challenges. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=67.0s)]
*  I've never been in a place where everything is a challenge [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=69.0s)]
*  or everything is a priority there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=72.0s)]
*  So if you speak to my U.N. colleagues [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=74.0s)]
*  and ask them to prioritize the work, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=77.0s)]
*  they will tell you that's not possible. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=79.0s)]
*  And that's the challenge of the West Bank and Jerusalem. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=81.0s)]
*  Likewise, there is a challenge on every front. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=84.0s)]
*  Right now, the main challenge we have is the public order. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=87.0s)]
*  We need to make sure that the working environment there [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=90.0s)]
*  is safe enough to deliver with accountability, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=94.0s)]
*  accountability to our staff [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=97.0s)]
*  and accountability to the affected population. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=98.0s)]
*  So this is the main challenge we have today. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=101.0s)]
*  Of course, there are the other challenges of logistics, access, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=104.0s)]
*  and what we are focusing on is the issue of lack of public order. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=109.0s)]
*  On the West Bank, I've visited more than one refugee camp. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=113.0s)]
*  I visited Tulkarem. I visited Jericho. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=117.0s)]
*  Definitely we have concerns about the settler violence. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=120.0s)]
*  And I've said more than one time, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=124.0s)]
*  we follow the SG instructions that, yes, all eyes are on Gaza, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=127.0s)]
*  but we shouldn't wait for the West Bank to become another Gaza. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=130.0s)]
*  I've met many people in Tulkarem camp. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=135.0s)]
*  We had discussions with them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=140.0s)]
*  I went to UNRWA schools. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=142.0s)]
*  I spoke to many girls now, many girls who are students. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=143.0s)]
*  They told me their daily suffering, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=148.0s)]
*  how is it difficult to live in a refugee camp? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=150.0s)]
*  They told me their feelings when the army comes, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=153.0s)]
*  when there is military activities happening and taking place there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=157.0s)]
*  To hear those stories, to hear those concerns from young girls who go to school [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=162.0s)]
*  and who are so worried about their future and their education, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=168.0s)]
*  to describe to you what they went through during the night [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=171.0s)]
*  before they went to school the following morning is really heartbreaking. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=175.0s)]
*  So the West Bank is a huge concern for us, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=180.0s)]
*  and we shouldn't wait until the West Bank becomes another Gaza. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=183.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=188.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Abdelhamid. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=190.0s)]
*  I have a question. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=192.0s)]
*  In my mind, I'll speak a little louder. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=196.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=199.0s)]
*  When was the last time you were in Gaza, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=205.0s)]
*  and what did you tell us about your first contact with people? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=208.0s)]
*  And if you can share with us some information about this detention center, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=213.0s)]
*  which is going to need time, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=218.0s)]
*  or we call it Israeli Guantanamo. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=222.0s)]
*  They have set up 1,000 Palestinian and 1,100 forced, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=226.0s)]
*  killed in that detention center. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=232.0s)]
*  Can you shed more light on the suffering of the Ethiopian and the Indian? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=236.0s)]
*  On the detention center, human rights are working on that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=242.0s)]
*  I think they are in a better place to speak about it than me. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=248.0s)]
*  I have not visited that place, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=251.0s)]
*  but I know that the human rights are looking into this, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=253.0s)]
*  so it's better that they speak about it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=258.0s)]
*  They're in a better place to talk about it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=260.0s)]
*  On Gaza, I was there a week ago, last Tuesday. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=263.0s)]
*  Not yesterday, of course, Tuesday before. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=266.0s)]
*  I saw a lot of challenges, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=269.0s)]
*  one of which I talked about the public order, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=271.0s)]
*  which is becoming a concern for us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=273.0s)]
*  I met with a variety of people. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=276.0s)]
*  The discussion that I had with the women group there [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=279.0s)]
*  was one I have never had in my entire career in the United Nations. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=287.0s)]
*  Women expressed to me how they go through difficulties living there [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=292.0s)]
*  as displaced in shelters, in UNO war schools. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=297.0s)]
*  By the way, the number one thing women complained about was basically privacy, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=302.0s)]
*  the lack of privacy and dignity. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=306.0s)]
*  When we talk about the people of Gaza, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=309.0s)]
*  and I always say when we talk about Gaza, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=311.0s)]
*  we need to move away from the truck talk. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=313.0s)]
*  We need to talk about people. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=316.0s)]
*  We need to see what people need, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=318.0s)]
*  and especially the women and the children. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=320.0s)]
*  The protection issue is very important for the people of Gaza. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=322.0s)]
*  So as I said during my discussions with them, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=327.0s)]
*  so many issues came into discussion. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=329.0s)]
*  They shared with me their personal struggle day in, day out. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=332.0s)]
*  Some women told me that they went for months, several months, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=337.0s)]
*  without taking showers. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=340.0s)]
*  Going to the bathroom is a challenge for them. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=343.0s)]
*  Being with their children, having a bit of privacy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=346.0s)]
*  Some women actually told me that they had to cut their hair, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=349.0s)]
*  others told me that they had to totally shave their hair [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=352.0s)]
*  because of lack of shampoo, lack of hygiene, lack of hygiene material. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=355.0s)]
*  It was one sad story after the other. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=359.0s)]
*  And for me, because I come from the region, I speak the language, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=363.0s)]
*  so there was no language barrier when I was speaking to them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=366.0s)]
*  I think they felt that it was safe enough for them to speak to me with transparency. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=369.0s)]
*  I can't say I know what they're going through, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=376.0s)]
*  but I can tell you I started to understand what they're going through. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=379.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody, any of us, can know what the people of Gaza are going through. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=382.0s)]
*  But in a way, we should try to understand, to help them, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=386.0s)]
*  because part of our response is to listen to people. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=389.0s)]
*  We can't assume that we know what they want and just deliver it to them. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=392.0s)]
*  We need to listen to the people, especially the most vulnerable people, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=396.0s)]
*  again, which are the women and the children in this case. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=400.0s)]
*  Let's not forget that there are a lot of elderly people. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=403.0s)]
*  There are people with special needs who no one talks about. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=405.0s)]
*  There are unaccompanied children, more than 17,000 unaccompanied children in Gaza. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=409.0s)]
*  Those people, we need to get access to them. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=414.0s)]
*  The reason that I say we need to move away from truck talk [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=418.0s)]
*  because issues like protection, those who don't load on a truck, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=422.0s)]
*  you need to have staff there, you need to have specialized agencies on the ground [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=426.0s)]
*  to make sure that there are, the protection issues are properly addressed. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=432.0s)]
*  Thank you. Gabriel? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=438.0s)]
*  Thank you. Gabriel Lozando from Al Jazeera English. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=439.0s)]
*  Were you able to speak to any Palestinians there who had been sheltering under the UN flag? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=443.0s)]
*  Because more than 500 have been killed while sheltering under the UN flag, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=451.0s)]
*  and that was normally a place of protection, but it's not in Gaza. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=456.0s)]
*  If you were able to talk to any Palestinians about do they still feel protected by the UN under the flag? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=460.0s)]
*  I don't think I'm the first one who would say there is no safe place in Gaza. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=469.0s)]
*  I think you heard it before. It's nothing new. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=473.0s)]
*  There is no safe place in Gaza. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=477.0s)]
*  Al Mawasi area where people were told to move, it was also targeted. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=479.0s)]
*  I feel sorry for the people of Gaza. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=487.0s)]
*  When I'm driving there in Gaza on the highways and I see people just stranded on the side of the road, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=490.0s)]
*  by the way, there are no tents in Gaza as people may think there are proper tents. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=495.0s)]
*  No, there are just sheltered material. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=499.0s)]
*  Most of the time you see men and women, most of the days are trying to sew and fix some plastic sheetings [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=502.0s)]
*  to try to cover themselves during the night. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=508.0s)]
*  But people know that there is no safe place. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=512.0s)]
*  People are always on the move. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=515.0s)]
*  They receive those instructions to evacuate, they grab whatever they can, they start with beloved ones, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=518.0s)]
*  with the elderly, with the children. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=525.0s)]
*  They carry them and they carry their dignity or whatever left of it with them. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=529.0s)]
*  And they just move from one place to the other. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=534.0s)]
*  Gaza is a sad story. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=538.0s)]
*  Everybody, there are two million sad stories in Gaza. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=540.0s)]
*  Seeing Gaza on the news, reading about Gaza is one thing, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=545.0s)]
*  but going there and listening to the agony of the people is totally another story. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=549.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=554.0s)]
*  Besad. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=555.0s)]
*  Besad, I'm quick, this is Zida Arabic. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=556.0s)]
*  So you were saying that part of your work is listening to the people, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=559.0s)]
*  but probably also their expectation is what is being given to them, given back to them, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=564.0s)]
*  to actually relieve all of this pain and suffering. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=570.0s)]
*  So what do you say to them in return? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=573.0s)]
*  The people of Gaza has an experience with the United Nations, starting with UNRWA for many years. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=578.0s)]
*  I think they know our mandate very well, and they know very well we're not politically driven and we're humanitarians. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=584.0s)]
*  The people of Gaza are educated people. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=590.0s)]
*  They even know the humanitarian principles and they know why we are there for. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=592.0s)]
*  We're not politically driven. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=597.0s)]
*  We're there to deliver aid to them. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=598.0s)]
*  But they also know the challenges. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=600.0s)]
*  Yes, they have high expectations, because if I were in their place and you were in their place, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=602.0s)]
*  you would have the same level of expectation from the United Nations, who has been serving you for decades and decades. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=606.0s)]
*  They know that we're there. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=612.0s)]
*  They know that we're there to stay. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=614.0s)]
*  We make it clear to them. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=615.0s)]
*  They saw us being present with them, even at their toughest times. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=617.0s)]
*  And every time we engage with them, we remind them of the words of the Secretary General, that we're there to stay and deliver. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=623.0s)]
*  And we will continue doing that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=632.0s)]
*  Yes, there are challenges, security challenges, logistics challenges. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=635.0s)]
*  All challenges you can think of in any similar situation in the world are there, and they're presenting themselves. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=639.0s)]
*  And they're magnified challenges. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=646.0s)]
*  But we are determined to remain with the people of Gaza. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=648.0s)]
*  Let's not forget that in absence of a political solution, the only solution is the humanitarian solutions. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=651.0s)]
*  We as humanitarians, unfortunately, we have to deal with the results of failed politics. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=657.0s)]
*  And this is what we're doing there. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=662.0s)]
*  We're waiting for the politicians to deliver a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=663.0s)]
*  But we as humanitarians will remain there with the people of Gaza to support them go through this difficult crisis. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=668.0s)]
*  And once it's over, we are determined to remain with them to help them rebuild their lives, early recovery, reconstructions. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=674.0s)]
*  We're there, and they know us, and they know our intentions. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=681.0s)]
*  And we have, you know, when you're in the business of saving lives, you don't have many options except to save lives. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=685.0s)]
*  And this is what we intend to do. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=692.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=694.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=695.0s)]
*  Question. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=696.0s)]
*  About the Jordanian. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=697.0s)]
*  The Palestinian-Israeli army is coming to Jordan. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=699.0s)]
*  So, yes, there is aid coming. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=702.0s)]
*  There are aids coming from Jordan, and it's entering through the Ares border. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=704.0s)]
*  So there is, yes, a Jordan corridor, and it's bringing aid. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=710.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=714.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh0BbssWMnc&t=715.0s)]
