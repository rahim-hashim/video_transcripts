# Jordan, Kuwait, Palestine & Slovenia, on shared commitments on UNRWA-Security Council Media Stakeout
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [May 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM)
*  Thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning everyone. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=30.0s)]
*  We thank you for being here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=46.0s)]
*  We wanted to make a short announcement, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=48.0s)]
*  being aware of the numerous operational, political, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=50.0s)]
*  and financial challenges UNRWA has been facing, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=53.0s)]
*  especially in the last few months, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=56.0s)]
*  we decided to launch an initiative of shared commitments on UNRWA. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=58.0s)]
*  This initiative follows up to the challenges addressed at the UN Security Council briefing in April, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=64.0s)]
*  General Assembly meeting in March, and the letter of the Commissioner General in February. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=73.0s)]
*  In accordance with its General Assembly mandate, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=80.0s)]
*  the agency has a vital role in providing life-saving humanitarian assistance [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=83.0s)]
*  and human development services to generations of Palestine refugees [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=89.0s)]
*  in the occupied Palestinian territory, Jordan, Lebanon, and the Syrian Arab Republic. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=94.0s)]
*  We therefore believe it is important for countries to reaffirm their support [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=101.0s)]
*  for the work of the agency and its indispensable role in providing assistance and relief, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=107.0s)]
*  and send signals of strong political support for UNRWA. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=113.0s)]
*  Shared commitments will address several aspects, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=118.0s)]
*  from UNRWA's role in Gaza and for regional stability, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=122.0s)]
*  to its financial crisis, questions relating to the principles of neutrality, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=127.0s)]
*  recognition of the tireless efforts of UNRWA's staff, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=133.0s)]
*  the importance of cooperation with the agency, and other aspects. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=137.0s)]
*  We hope the initiative will garner strong support. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=143.0s)]
*  Today, we will address a letter to the permanent representatives inviting them to join it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=147.0s)]
*  We seize this opportunity to reaffirm in these difficult, challenging, and tragic circumstances [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=154.0s)]
*  our firm commitment to the just resolution of the question of Palestine, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=161.0s)]
*  including on the Palestinian refugees, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=166.0s)]
*  and the achievement of just comprehensive and lasting peace in the region, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=169.0s)]
*  consistent with UN resolutions and international law, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=174.0s)]
*  and the realization of the two-state solution based on the pre-1967 lines. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=178.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=185.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=191.0s)]
*  Good morning, everyone. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=197.0s)]
*  Allow me at the beginning to thank Jordan, Kuwait, and Slovenia, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=205.0s)]
*  and all of our friends, the other countries who are assembled with us this morning, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=212.0s)]
*  for undertaking this important initiative to rally support to UNRWA [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=219.0s)]
*  at this extremely critical time for the agency and more so for the Palestine refugees, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=225.0s)]
*  especially in the Gaza Strip, as my brother Mahmoud has indicated, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=232.0s)]
*  where nearly all of the refugee population has been forcibly displaced [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=237.0s)]
*  and is suffering gravely from the atrocities inflicted on them by Israel, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=243.0s)]
*  the occupying power which has caused so much human loss and devastation. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=250.0s)]
*  The indispensable role UNRWA has played and continue to play is only possible [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=259.0s)]
*  with the international community's support for its General Assembly mandate, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=267.0s)]
*  and we are grateful that the support has been overwhelming and with cross-regional backing, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=273.0s)]
*  and of course with the generosity of donor countries supporting UNRWA education, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=281.0s)]
*  health, relief, social, and emergency services. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=287.0s)]
*  We welcome the launch of these shared commitments and hope that many other states [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=292.0s)]
*  will join and affirm these commitments in support of UNRWA. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=300.0s)]
*  UNRWA does not only need financial support, but it needs political support, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=305.0s)]
*  and this effort is a significant step in having this political support for UNRWA [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=312.0s)]
*  on the basis of its mandate as we see it in the General Assembly. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=318.0s)]
*  We urge action to uphold UNRWA's mandate in all fields of operation, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=323.0s)]
*  in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and in Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=330.0s)]
*  to enable continued delivery of its core services and life-saving aid [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=337.0s)]
*  that have for decades contributed to the welfare and development of Palestine refugees [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=344.0s)]
*  while also giving them a measure of dignity and hope in the midst of so much despair. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=351.0s)]
*  We again express our appreciation to the sponsors of this urgent and timely initiative [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=360.0s)]
*  and hope that many countries will join this effort supporting UNRWA [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=369.0s)]
*  and sending a meaningful message of solidarity to the Palestinian people. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=374.0s)]
*  And it is a wonderful omen, as we assemble today, that we received very positive news from Europe [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=380.0s)]
*  that Spain, Ireland, and Norway declared today that they will be recognizing the state of Palestine [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=389.0s)]
*  on the 28th of this month. This European wave, hopefully, will be followed by other waves. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=398.0s)]
*  The support to the state of Palestine, its admission to the UN, and recognition, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=407.0s)]
*  is taking momentum after what we did in the Security Council and what we did in the General Assembly. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=414.0s)]
*  The state of Palestine deserves to be a full member state in the United Nations. Thank you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=424.0s)]
*  Thank you all. If there are any questions, we're happy to answer. Otherwise, we can conclude. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=430.0s)]
*  I'll just do one. Thank you. My name is Gabriel Elizondo from Al Jazeera English. Thank you for the briefing, sir. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=441.0s)]
*  Can you just talk about why it's so important to show this unity towards UNRWA at this particular critical moment right now? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=448.0s)]
*  Thank you. That's an excellent question. Obviously, in the past few months, the attack on UNRWA, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=456.0s)]
*  the politicized attack on UNRWA has necessitated this kind of effort. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=464.0s)]
*  And after the Colona report, it became clear that UNRWA has all the procedures in place [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=468.0s)]
*  and has implemented such procedures to guarantee its neutrality. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=474.0s)]
*  As such, the report gave a clean bill of health and a roadmap for UNRWA to implement, which UNRWA is implementing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=478.0s)]
*  And we saw that the donors, at least most of them, we can say, have returned to making their payments and contributions. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=485.0s)]
*  And we think it is important to send a clear political message of support from all countries [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=495.0s)]
*  for the indispensable role that UNRWA is playing and will be playing until a two-state solution is realized [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=501.0s)]
*  when Palestine is achieved, independent, and the refugees can exercise their rights under international law. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=509.0s)]
*  Actually, if I can ask a question to Ambassador Mansour Bisanoukouk with Prime Minister of the Arab Emirates. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=520.0s)]
*  I mean, we see this show of unity this morning here. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=525.0s)]
*  We, as you mentioned, the announcement from Ireland, Spain, and Norway. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=529.0s)]
*  But at the same time, the Israelis are threatening to target Palestinian authority officials. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=534.0s)]
*  They're actually threatening to go back to 2005 in Jenin with settlements. If you have any comments on that? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=539.0s)]
*  Well, we believe that this massive unity that you see today, the unity in the General Assembly [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=546.0s)]
*  when we were able to garner 143 positive votes versus nine, and the 12 members in the Security Council [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=556.0s)]
*  voting yes to admit the state of Palestine to membership, including all members of the European Union [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=568.0s)]
*  versus only one that casted a veto. All these things are indication that the momentum is getting bigger and bigger [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=578.0s)]
*  in favor of justice for the Palestinian people. At least in the UN, justice means admitting the state of Palestine to full membership. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=589.0s)]
*  There's only one that is panicking in its response, and here I'm referring to the occupying authorities [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=600.0s)]
*  and the government of the state of Israel. Instead of learning the lessons and listening to this massive international strong voice, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=609.0s)]
*  they are heading in the wrong direction by challenging everyone, attacking everyone, insulting everyone, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=621.0s)]
*  starting from the Secretary General, through the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Human Rights Council, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=632.0s)]
*  every and single country, including the three countries that announced today that they will recognize the state of Palestine [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=640.0s)]
*  as an investment in peace and saving the two-state solution. So if you look at that picture, who is on the wrong side of history [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=649.0s)]
*  and who is on the right side of history, and I think that we will continue the pressure, all of us, until the last obstacle, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=658.0s)]
*  standing on our way of acquiring our natural and legal right for admission to become a reality. I can see it as I see you in front of me. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=666.0s)]
*  It's only a matter of time before that is happening. Please keep reporting on these things at the UN. Report who are the reasonable ones [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=680.0s)]
*  and who are the crazy ones, and we thank you for doing so. Thank you so much. I believe we're done. Thank you. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=690.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=710.0s)]
*  Samuel, look at that picture. Someone's here. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=740.0s)]
*  We need somebody to take pictures. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=755.0s)]
*  Anne, can you take pictures? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=761.0s)]
*  Okay. I guess you know who we are. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=771.0s)]
*  Glorious day today. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=789.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_yzEMUyTrM&t=800.0s)]
