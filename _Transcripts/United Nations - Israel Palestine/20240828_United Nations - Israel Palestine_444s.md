# Israel on Gaza - Media Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4)
*  Hello, good morning everybody. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=0.0s)]
*  Today the Security Council is convened to renew UNIFRS mandate, but what good does this mandate [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=7.96s)]
*  do when it fails so miserably to meet any of its objectives? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=14.16s)]
*  On July 27th, in the northern town of Majdal Shams, 12 innocent children were brutally [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=19.6s)]
*  murdered by Hezbollah, their lives stolen by Iranian-made missiles. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=25.64s)]
*  This attack was a direct result of the failure of UNIFRS and the Lebanese government to implement [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  Resolution 1701. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=39.08s)]
*  The tragic loss in Majdal Shams is not an isolated incident. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=41.56s)]
*  Since October 8th, Hezbollah has launched hundreds of rocket attacks, killing almost [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=45.68s)]
*  40 Israelis and displacing over 60,000 from their homes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=51.12s)]
*  If you compare it to the U.S., it's equal to 3.5 million Americans displaced during [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=58.8s)]
*  the war time. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah's violations of Resolution 1701 have gone unchecked despite countless warnings [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  and appeals. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=72.58s)]
*  UNIFRS' inability to enforce its mandate has allowed Hezbollah to build its arsenal [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=73.58s)]
*  and take control in southern Lebanon, transforming it into a terrorist haven that threatens the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=79.96s)]
*  entire region. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=86.32s)]
*  UNIFRS forces must be active and effective in their enforcement of Resolution 1701. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=89.28s)]
*  The situation in which Hezbollah launches rockets, missiles and drones at Israel from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  sites next to UNIFRS bases is unacceptable. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=101.32s)]
*  Allow me to show you one of the pictures I will present today in the Security Council. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=106.48s)]
*  In that picture we see a UN base which next to the base, 100 meters from the base, you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  see the location where rockets were launched into civilian population in Israel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  And I have dozens of pictures like this one and we can share it with you after the debate. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=126.4s)]
*  Basically what it shows is that Hezbollah places the rocket launchers next to the UNIFRS [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=132.0s)]
*  bases. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=139.84s)]
*  So when we want to retaliate or attack, we will have to target facilities which are 70 [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=140.84s)]
*  meters from the base of UNIFRS. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  We have this picture, we obtained dozens of events like that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't think you will read about it in the reports of UNIFRS, but it's important that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=158.84s)]
*  it will be revealed. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=163.28s)]
*  This situation cannot and will not continue. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=170.0s)]
*  I have a message for the Lebanese people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=173.28s)]
*  You and your government have a choice to make. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=175.92s)]
*  Confront Hezbollah today or watch as your country is dragged into chaos and destruction. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=179.16s)]
*  The time for action is now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=185.56s)]
*  Do not let Hezbollah and Iran dictate your future. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=188.0s)]
*  If you fail to act, the devastation that follows will be on your hands. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=193.16s)]
*  Israel does not seek war, but as we demonstrated this week, we will not hesitate to defend [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=199.64s)]
*  our people. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=205.28s)]
*  We will not tolerate Hezbollah firing rockets at our citizens. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=206.72s)]
*  The time for the international community to act is now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=211.08s)]
*  Before this conflict spirals further out of control, we call on this Council to finally [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=214.88s)]
*  enforce Resolution 1701 in full and to recognize Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=232.64s)]
*  Ambassador, Gabriel Osando from Al-Syria. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=233.64s)]
*  Thank you for your words. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=236.64s)]
*  Israel launched some of the biggest raids in the occupied West Bank in the last decades [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  overnight, since about 20 years ago. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  Minister Katz has posted on X that he calls for the temporary evacuation of Palestinians [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=249.76s)]
*  from the West Bank. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  How do you plan to do that and when does your government plan to do that? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=256.36s)]
*  First, let's speak about the facts. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=260.24s)]
*  The facts are that Iran is trying to infiltrate also Judean Samaria. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  We are talking about multiple fronts, but we have evidence of Iranians trying to smuggle [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=268.36s)]
*  weapons into Judean Samaria and we have seen rise in terror attacks in Israel. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=276.12s)]
*  So we take the measures necessary to prevent terror activities in Israel and in Judean [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=281.76s)]
*  Samaria and we will do whatever is necessary. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=287.8s)]
*  We have seen activities in some of the locations you mentioned and we will see more. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=291.68s)]
*  Whenever we know there is a threat for Israelis and we can take care of that threat, we will [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=296.64s)]
*  do that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=301.8s)]
*  You are planning to evacuate Palestinians from the West Bank, sir? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=302.8s)]
*  Like the minister said on social media this morning? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  We prove that we are capable of fighting terrorism in Judean Samaria and we will continue to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=308.7s)]
*  do that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=313.64s)]
*  Ambassador, Margaret Beshear with Voice of America. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=314.64s)]
*  This week both the United Nations and more than two dozen aid groups have said that their [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  aid operations have come to practically a halt in Gaza due to the 16th evacuation order [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=323.56s)]
*  that Israel issued in the Strip. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=330.56s)]
*  Can you give us your reaction to this and are you taking into consideration this fact [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=333.64s)]
*  in your military planning? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=340.64s)]
*  Like we spoke last week, people are spreading facts which are not true. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=343.2s)]
*  This is an example of that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=349.4s)]
*  We discussed polio last week. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=351.36s)]
*  The reports are not correct. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=353.12s)]
*  We have a mechanism for coordination between COGAT which deals with the situation today [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=355.02000000000004s)]
*  in Gaza and with UN organs, WHO, UNICEF and we continue to work closely with them to monitor [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=360.24s)]
*  the situation, to collaborate and we will continue to do that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=370.04s)]
*  I don't accept those reports. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=374.8s)]
*  Yes it's not easy for the UN organs and other NGOs to operate in Gaza today. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=378.64s)]
*  That's true and we all know who is to be blamed for that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=383.96s)]
*  Hamas started this war and we have to finish what they started on October 7th. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=386.44s)]
*  But we are working with the NGOs. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=392.0s)]
*  We have the mechanism and only last night they had a meeting to speak about the problems [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  and about the issues we can work together on. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  You mentioned the polio campaign that's going to launch on Saturday. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=402.92s)]
*  Will Israel grant the humanitarians the short ceasefire that they're asking for in order [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=407.52s)]
*  to vaccinate the children in Gaza? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=413.36s)]
*  I mentioned last week that 98% of the people in Gaza are vaccinated and Israel will work [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=416.08s)]
*  with WHO and other organs to support all the campaigns to bring vaccines into Gaza. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=423.84s)]
*  I want to thank you very much. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=431.79999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNE-WiOKJV4&t=433.08s)]
