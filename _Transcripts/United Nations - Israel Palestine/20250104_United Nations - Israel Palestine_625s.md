Video Description: Briefing by Dr. Richard Peeperkorn, World Health Organization's (WHO) representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.

--------------
Also briefing via video teleconference, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Representative for the West Bank and Gaza, Rik Peeperkorn, said, “time and again, hospitals have become battlegrounds, rendering them out of service and depriving those in need of lifesaving care. The health sector is being systematically dismantled and pushed to the breaking point, its resilience tested amid dire shortages of medical supplies, equipment, and specialized staff. Only 16 out of 36 hospitals in Gaza remain partially functional, with a total bed capacity of just 1,822—far below what is needed to address the overwhelming health crisis.”

Peeperkorn said the WHO “remains deeply concerned about Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, the Director of Kamal Adwan Hospital who was detained during the raid,” and called “for his immediate release.”

He said, “reports indicate that key areas of the hospital were burnt and severely damaged during the raid, including the laboratory, surgical unit, engineering and maintenance department, operations theatre, and the medical store. WHO and partners' efforts over the last months to sustain the hospitals’ operations have been undone.”

Back in the Council Chambers, Palestinian Ambassador Riyad H. Mansour said, “Doctor Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Al Awda Hospital, wrote a message many months ago on a whiteboard in the hospital normally used for planning surgeries.”

Holding back tears as he quoted Dr Nujaila, Mansour said, “whoever stays until the end will tell the story. We did what we could. Remember us. Remember us.”

For his part, Israeli Ambassador Brett Jonathan Miller said, “this week’s precise operation by the IDF revealed the extent of Hamas's abuse of the facility. Over 240 terrorists were apprehended, including 15 who participated on October 7th massacre, the darkest day in Israel's modern history where with 1,200 lives were brutally taken by the terrorists. Among those apprehended was a hospital director himself, who suspected of being a Hamas operative, as hundreds of Hamas and Islamic defectors were hiding inside the Kamal Adwan hospital under his management. He is currently being investigated by Israeli security forces. Colleagues, this operation was not a choice. It was a necessity, conducted based on extensive intelligence gathered over months, confirming Hamas's activities on hospital premises. In accordance with international humanitarian law, the IDF has implemented comprehensive measures to mitigate harm to civilians.”

# Gaza: WHO Warns Hospitals on Brink Amid Damage, Detentions, & Health Crisis | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [January 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w)
*  I now give the floor to Dr. Rick Piperkorn. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President, Excellencies. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=11.0s)]
*  My name is Dr. Rick Piperkorn. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=14.0s)]
*  I'm a WHO representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=16.0s)]
*  I do visit Gaza very regularly every two and a half months, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=21.0s)]
*  I'd say between two and four weeks, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=26.0s)]
*  and have been participating on multiple of these WHO-led missions [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=28.0s)]
*  to all hospitals all over Gaza, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=32.0s)]
*  and some of them which we will focus on today. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=34.0s)]
*  So first of all, thank you for this opportunity to review on the health situation in Gaza. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=37.0s)]
*  2025 begins on a somber and deeply worrying note, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=43.0s)]
*  as fighting continues to intensify and hope dwindles for Gazans [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=48.0s)]
*  who have been enduring this nightmare for 14 months. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=54.0s)]
*  Approximately 7% of the population has been killed or injured since October 2023, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=58.0s)]
*  with over 25% of the more than 105,000 injured people suffering from life-changing injuries, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=66.0s)]
*  which will need extensive rehabilitation and lifelong medical assistive technologies, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=75.0s)]
*  according to WHO and partners' estimates. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=82.0s)]
*  Time and again, hospitals have become battlegrounds, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=85.0s)]
*  rendering them out of service and repriving those in need of life-saving care. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=90.0s)]
*  The health sector is being systematically dismantled and pushed to the breaking point. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=95.0s)]
*  It's resilience tested amid dire shortages of medical supplies, equipment, and specialized staff. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=101.0s)]
*  Only 16 of the 36 hospitals in Gaza remain partially functional, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=109.0s)]
*  with a total bed capacity of just 1,822, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=116.0s)]
*  far below what is needed to address the overwhelming health crisis. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=121.0s)]
*  Due to damage, attacks, and shortages, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=126.0s)]
*  most hospitals can only provide basic care and lack the capacity for specialized treatment [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=129.0s)]
*  of chronic diseases and complex injuries, leading to increased suffering and death. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=136.0s)]
*  Despite these challenges, the pace of medical evacuations remains extremely slow. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=141.0s)]
*  Since October 2023, only 5,383 patients have been evacuated abroad [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=147.0s)]
*  for medical treatment with support from WHO and its partners. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=154.0s)]
*  Of these, only 436 have been evacuated since the closure of the RAFA crossing of 6th of May 2024, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=159.0s)]
*  with WHO organized and facilitated by WHO. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=169.0s)]
*  Over 12,000 people still require medical evacuation, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=173.0s)]
*  and at the current rate, it would take 5 to 10 years to evacuate all these critical ill patients, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=179.0s)]
*  including thousands of children. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=185.0s)]
*  Despite this challenging environment, WHO and partners are doing all they can to keep hospitals and health services operational. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=188.0s)]
*  However, our ability to move aid is severely compromised. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=196.0s)]
*  The entry of supplies into and across Gaza remains extremely slow due to restrictions, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=200.0s)]
*  delays in the clearance of supplies entering the strip, and obstacles to our missions within Gaza. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=207.0s)]
*  In 2024 alone, only 111 out of 279, so that's only 40%, of WHO missions were facilitated, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=213.0s)]
*  directly impacting our ability to safely and promptly resupply hospitals, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=225.0s)]
*  transfer critical patients, and deploy emergency medical teams. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=231.0s)]
*  Since October 2023, almost every week, WHO has repeatedly issued urgent calls to protect health workers and hospitals, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=237.0s)]
*  as per international humanitarian law. Yet these calls remain unheard. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=246.0s)]
*  Attacks on hospitals persist. To date, WHO has verified 654 attacks on health care facilities in Gaza, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=251.0s)]
*  resulting in 886 fatalities and 1,349 injuries. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=259.0s)]
*  In North Gaza, which has been under siege for approximately 90 days, the health and humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=265.0s)]
*  Only our other hospital remains minimal functional, and there are no primary health care facilities available in the area. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=274.0s)]
*  The lack of health care poses a severe threat to the lives of thousands of Palestinians still in the area. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=282.0s)]
*  Kamalat 1 Hospital, the main hospital in North Gaza, was put out of service following a raid last week, a relentless attack since October this year. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=289.0s)]
*  WHO was constantly hindered in accessing the hospital during this period, with only 10 out of 21 missions partially facilitated. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=298.0s)]
*  On 27 December, the hospital was emptied, a majority of the patients were forced to a nearby location, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=308.0s)]
*  while critical patients were transferred to the non-functional Indonesian hospital, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=316.0s)]
*  which lacks the necessary equipment and supplies to provide adequate care. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=322.0s)]
*  WHO remains deeply concerned about Dr. Hussama Wusafia, the director of Kamalat 1 Hospital, who was detained during the raid. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=327.0s)]
*  We have lost contact with him since and call for his immediate release. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=335.0s)]
*  Reports indicate that key areas of the hospital were burned and severely damaged during the raid, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=340.0s)]
*  including the laboratory, surgical unit, engineering and maintenance department, operation theatre and a medical store. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=346.0s)]
*  WHO and partners' efforts over the last months to sustain the hospital's operations have been undone. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=354.0s)]
*  We call for urgent access to the hospital to assess the damage and determine if it can be restored. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=362.0s)]
*  We also urge for facilitation to transfer the medical equipment from Kamalat 1 to OALDA and other hospitals in Gaza City. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=368.0s)]
*  At Indonesian Hospital, the situation continues to deteriorate. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=376.0s)]
*  Although the hospital is out of service, seven patients, nine caregivers and six health workers remain there. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=380.0s)]
*  Today, the hospital reportedly receives an order to evacuate and to provide a list of name and details of all those still inside. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=388.0s)]
*  We urge that the hospital and its remaining patients, who are in a dangerous and active conflict zone, be protected. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=397.0s)]
*  The hospital is already severely damaged and further attacks will make it even harder to restore the facility. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=404.0s)]
*  Al-Ada, which is the last remaining minimal functional hospital in North Gaza, is struggling to stay open. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=411.0s)]
*  Hostilities continue around hospitals, resulting in an influx of injury. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=420.0s)]
*  37 inpatients remain in sight. Food and water and fuel are depleting fast. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=425.0s)]
*  The hospital has been without many essential medicines for more than 85 days. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=431.0s)]
*  Access to the hospital is dangerous for patients in need due to the hostilities nearby. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=437.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have just received reports that Al-Ada 2 has been ordered to fully evacuate. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=442.0s)]
*  With this, the last health lifeline in North Gaza is at a risk of being severed. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=450.0s)]
*  WHO is planning a mission to Al-Ada, Kamal al-Wan and Indonesian Hospital for assessment. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=456.0s)]
*  However, currently no roads to Kamal al-Wan and Al-Ada are accessible. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=462.0s)]
*  We urge for access to be facilitated urgently and for evacuation orders to be rescinded. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=466.0s)]
*  As I close, I want to emphasize that despite the incomprehensible challenges, the health system of Gaza has not collapsed. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=473.0s)]
*  It is deeply affected and bruised, but against all odds, health workers, the WHO and partners have kept services going as much as possible. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=483.0s)]
*  Al-Shifa, as examples of Al-Shifa and Nasr al-Malik complex, which have been restored after being left in ruins, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=494.0s)]
*  including European Gaza Hospital following severe attacks, raids and destruction earlier this year, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=502.0s)]
*  are prime examples of the resilience of the Gaza health system and the inspiring dedication of its health workers with support of WHO and partners. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=508.0s)]
*  This is nothing short of a feat and is a reason to be hopeful. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=518.0s)]
*  It shows what can be achieved if healthcare is protected and peace is given a chance. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=523.0s)]
*  I want to remind that hospitals have a special protection under international humanitarian law because of their life-saving functions. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=528.0s)]
*  While hospitals may, under specific and limited circumstances, lose their protected status, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=537.0s)]
*  such use does not then absolve any party from its obligations to comply with all other relevant rules of international humanitarian law [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=544.0s)]
*  that are applicable when launching attacks on military objectives, including the principles of distinction, precautions in attack and proportionality. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=554.0s)]
*  This remains fully applicable. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=564.0s)]
*  Lastly, I once again repeat WHO call to ensure urgently that hospitals in North Gaza can be supported to become functional again [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=567.0s)]
*  for an expedited pace of medical evacuation and use all corridors from Gaza to get patients out, including to the West Bank and East Jerusalem. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=580.0s)]
*  For sustained access to hospitals, for increased flow of aid and information across and goods across Gaza, and for urgent and lasting ceasefire. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=593.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President, for your care and then excellencies for your attention. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=607.0s)]
*  I thank Dr. Rick Piperkorn for his briefing. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=615.0s)]
*  I now give the floor to Dr. David Piperkorn. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czAMzV8cj-w&t=619.0s)]
