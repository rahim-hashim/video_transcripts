# France on Gaza and Security Council - Security Council Media Stakeout
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM)
*  Good morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, while the situation in the Gaza Strip remains dire, the Security Council failed [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=3.0s)]
*  one more time to adopt a resolution to call for an immediate and long-lasting ceasefire. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=14.0s)]
*  France voted in favor of this resolution, and we deeply regret that the Council remains [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=21.04s)]
*  unable to speak with one voice on the situation in the Middle East. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=27.159999999999997s)]
*  France has condemned since day one the terrorist attacks committed by Hamas against Israeli [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=32.16s)]
*  civilians and reaffirmed our long-standing commitment to the security of Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=37.599999999999994s)]
*  There is an obvious urgency to implement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=44.44s)]
*  This is the only way to guarantee the protection of all civilians and the massive and unhindered [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=52.96s)]
*  delivery of emergency aid. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=58.96s)]
*  The draft resolution rejected today was also calling clearly and firmly for an immediate [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=61.96s)]
*  and unconditional release of all hostages. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  As France counts two nationals who are still held hostage in Gaza, this remains one of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=75.39999999999999s)]
*  our priorities. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  Therefore, we deplore today's failure of the UN Security Council. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  France will remain resolutely committed to the full mobilization of this Council on every [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  aspect of the crisis. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  We will actively engage all its regional partners to achieve a sustainable peace in the Middle [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=101.84s)]
*  East. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=109.84s)]
*  Only a two-state solution can meet the needs for the security of Israel and the Israeli [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=110.84s)]
*  people, as well as the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinians for a state. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=116.84s)]
*  It requires the creation of a Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=121.84s)]
*  with Israel. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=128.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=129.84s)]
*  Thank you, Ambassador. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=131.28s)]
*  We'll stand up quick with Al Jazeera. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=132.28s)]
*  So what should we expect in terms of next steps, especially as the year is coming to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=135.28s)]
*  an end and we will have a new administration in place beginning next year? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=140.28s)]
*  If this has been vetoed today, what are the chances to actually pass anything before the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=145.28s)]
*  end of the year? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=150.28s)]
*  So I think it's a very sad day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=151.28s)]
*  I think the Security Council should continue to push. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=153.28s)]
*  This is obviously a humanitarian disaster, but it's not just a humanitarian disaster. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=158.72s)]
*  To resolve the humanitarian crisis, you need an immediate ceasefire. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=163.72s)]
*  And we will continue to push for that in the Security Council, maybe in the General Assembly, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=168.72s)]
*  everywhere. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=174.72s)]
*  I know it's difficult. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=175.72s)]
*  Today, between you and me, I think it's a very sad day and extremely regrettable. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=176.72s)]
*  This resolution was pretty good. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=183.72s)]
*  It was sending the right message, immediate ceasefire, immediate and unconditional release [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=186.16s)]
*  of all hostages. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=192.16s)]
*  And there is no credible justification to object to that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=194.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=202.16s)]
*  Talal Hajj from Al Arabiya Dal Hadath. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=203.16s)]
*  I just want to say something that this is a terrible message from the Security Council [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=206.16s)]
*  today to the people in Gaza who are looking for the Council for help. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=211.6s)]
*  And now, really, there is no end in sight for the suffering and the hunger and the collective [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=215.6s)]
*  punishment. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=221.6s)]
*  My question is on Lebanon. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=222.6s)]
*  We understand now that France and the United States will form an observation mission for [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=225.6s)]
*  the border area between Israel and Lebanon, part of the agreement that they are working [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=231.6s)]
*  out now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=237.6s)]
*  The Lebanese army will take responsibility of that area, but you will be supervising [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=239.04s)]
*  and monitoring. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=246.04s)]
*  Can you tell us more about this mission, how it's going to be formed? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=247.04s)]
*  Talks are going on. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=255.04s)]
*  There is, of course, a project to put in place some kind of monitoring mechanism that would [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=256.04s)]
*  accompany a ceasefire in the south of Lebanon. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=264.04s)]
*  So we are working on that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=267.48s)]
*  I think the U.S. are playing a very active role. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=268.48s)]
*  I hope we will finalize it in hours or days to come. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=271.48s)]
*  The situation in the south of Lebanon is bad, not just in the south of Lebanon, because [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=276.48s)]
*  the whole by-route is bombed as well. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=280.48s)]
*  So it needs to happen now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=283.48s)]
*  The sooner, the better. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=285.48s)]
*  What we need to keep in mind is that the framework remains the full implementation of Resolution [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=288.48s)]
*  1701. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=294.48s)]
*  It's dating 2006. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=295.92s)]
*  I was lucky enough to negotiate it back then. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=297.92s)]
*  It's not implemented 100 percent. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=301.92s)]
*  It needs to be fully implemented. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=306.92s)]
*  We don't need another framework. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=308.92s)]
*  1701 says a couple of things. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=310.92s)]
*  It puts obligations on Lebanon, and Lebanon has not fulfilled its obligations, meaning [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=313.92s)]
*  deploying the Lebanese army to the south. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  It needs to happen now. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=321.92s)]
*  This is why France organized a conference in Paris last month and raised money to help [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=323.86s)]
*  the Lebanese army to deploy to the south. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=328.86s)]
*  This is a key priority. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=331.86s)]
*  It needs to happen. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=332.86s)]
*  UNIFIL is not mandated to just enforce peace in the south of Lebanon. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=334.86s)]
*  The Lebanese army should deploy to the south. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=340.86s)]
*  This is priority number one. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=342.86s)]
*  Priority number two with 1701 is a full respect of the borders and the territorial integrity [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=344.86s)]
*  of Lebanon, meaning that Israel has no right to stay in Lebanon. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=353.3s)]
*  So I think it's very clear. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=358.3s)]
*  We need these two dimensions. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=360.3s)]
*  We need to implement this resolution. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=363.3s)]
*  We need UNIFIL to help. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=366.3s)]
*  We may need UNIFIL to do more in terms of monitoring the situation in the south, but [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=368.3s)]
*  we will continue to work hard as well. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=374.3s)]
*  Just a quick follow-up. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=377.74s)]
*  How soon do you expect an agreement on this 13-point plan? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=378.74s)]
*  I hope it could happen in the next days. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=383.74s)]
*  I think there is... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=387.74s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=388.74s)]
*  I think there are talks going on, but I will not comment on that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=389.74s)]
*  It's not taking place yet. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=392.74s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=394.74s)]
*  Ambassador, one follow-up on Lebanon? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrS1NSQ8OHM&t=395.74s)]
