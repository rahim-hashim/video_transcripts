# Israel on UNRWA/Gaza - Security Council Media Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs)
*  Good morning everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=11.68s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, will deliver a brief statement ahead of this [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=12.68s)]
*  morning's Security Council session. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=17.52s)]
*  He'll take your questions afterwards. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=20.72s)]
*  If you are asked for a question, please remember to state your name and your news outlet. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=22.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=26.16s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=29.08s)]
*  For over a year, we have exposed UNRWA Gaza at the terrorist front, posing as a humanitarian [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=30.08s)]
*  agency. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=35.199999999999996s)]
*  The scandals tied to UNRWA Gaza are staggering almost countless. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=36.199999999999996s)]
*  Months ago, we revealed that over 100 UNRWA employees were Hamas operatives, providing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=41.28s)]
*  their names and Hamas IDs to the UN. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Yet no action was taken. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=50.44s)]
*  More recently, we exposed an UNRWA clinic in Gaza, which was being used as a weapons [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=53.68s)]
*  depot and launch site. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=58.64s)]
*  At the same time, the head of UNRWA's teachers union in Lebanon was also a Hamas commander. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=61.32s)]
*  Today, I will bring news to the Security Council and we will share the story of Muhammad Abu [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=68.4s)]
*  Itiwi, an UNRWA employee since July 2022, who also served as a commander in Hamas' [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=75.44s)]
*  brutal Nukba forces. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=82.52s)]
*  He himself personally participated and murdered, raped and abducted Israelis. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=85.0s)]
*  While Muhammad Abu Itiwi was collecting UN-funded paychecks, he was murdering and kidnapping [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=92.04s)]
*  Israeli civilians. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=98.04s)]
*  Following his elimination, UN officials had the audacity to mourn him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=100.4s)]
*  The Secretary General himself, Antonio Guterres, expressed outrage at the death of this terrorist, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=105.56s)]
*  a man responsible for some of the most savage attacks on innocent civilians in modern history. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=113.0s)]
*  My colleagues, it is legitimate to criticize Israel, to debate the subject, but it is entirely [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=120.24s)]
*  illegitimate to ignore, dismiss or blind oneself to what stands so plainly before us. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  It is neither illegitimate nor moral to disregard the undeniable fact that UNRWA Gaza has become [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=133.64s)]
*  a front for Hamas. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=140.28s)]
*  And yet, that is precisely what the Secretary General is doing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=142.64s)]
*  Look at this picture. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=148.44s)]
*  You can see Faisal Ali, Mosalem and Nami in the black shirt. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=150.44s)]
*  Here you see him loading the lifeless body of Jonathan Samerno into his car, a grotex [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=157.44s)]
*  trophy bound for Gaza after his terrorist comrades murdered Jonathan at Kibbutz Be'eri. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=166.08s)]
*  There is also a video that you can find online of this incident. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=173.08s)]
*  Looking at this horrific image, one must ask, how does kidnapping and killing civilians [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=179.0s)]
*  fit into an UNRWA employee's job description? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=184.26000000000002s)]
*  Where in UNRWA's mandate is this justified? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=188.84s)]
*  We will hear a lot from Council members about UNRWA in a few minutes. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=193.16s)]
*  I'm going to ask them, are they aware of what the money they are donating to UNRWA is being used for? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=197.84s)]
*  There is no longer any plausible deniability regarding UNRWA's infiltration by terrorists. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=206.52s)]
*  No, are there any excuses left? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=212.96s)]
*  These vile scandals cannot be swept under the rug any longer. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=216.76s)]
*  This Council, the international community and the entire UN must confront the fact that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=221.08s)]
*  UNRWA Gaza is beyond redemption, beyond reform, beyond any justification. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=227.2s)]
*  We must turn the page now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=234.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=237.96s)]
*  Ambassador, the ST said in a statement yesterday, late night, that the implementation of these [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  laws will be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=245.28s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  What is your reaction to this? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  We will continue to work with the UN. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=253.76000000000002s)]
*  We will continue to work with UN organs who are focused on humanitarian assistance to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=256.0s)]
*  the Palestinian, but not in terrorism. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=261.12s)]
*  We are proving that that's pure terrorism. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=264.16s)]
*  You have WHO, UNICEF, World Food Program, dozens of NGOs that operate today in Gaza. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=266.4s)]
*  We will continue to work with them, but we will not continue to work with UNRWA after [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=273.44s)]
*  what we just exposed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=278.12s)]
*  But why didn't you give any proof of your allegations when I'm not sure you had answered [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  these evidence that you... [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=287.0s)]
*  We submitted the names of people that we know. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not as we think, that we know that they are terrorists. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=294.6s)]
*  We haven't got any answers. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=297.64s)]
*  And usually what UNRWA will tell us is that they don't have the capabilities to investigate [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=299.28s)]
*  to police and that they work under a dire situation inside Gaza. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=303.64s)]
*  But that's... [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=309.64s)]
*  Excuse me, let me answer your question. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=310.64s)]
*  But that's not acceptable. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=312.08s)]
*  That's not acceptable that you had UNRWA employees that took part in October 7th. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=313.92s)]
*  This picture was taken inside Israel in Kibbutz Be'eri. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=319.24s)]
*  That's not enough evidence. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=322.56s)]
*  You didn't give any evidence to the OIOS. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=323.56s)]
*  We provided... [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=326.8s)]
*  We're not talking about UNRWA. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=327.8s)]
*  We provided a list of UNRWA employees who were at the same time collecting paychecks [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=328.8s)]
*  from the UN and working for Hamas. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=333.6s)]
*  They had a day job with Hamas and at night they worked for UNRWA. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  That was unacceptable. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=341.16s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=342.16s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, this is Maryam Ramadi with Iran International. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=343.16s)]
*  As you said, President Biden emphasized that these laws are going to worsen the humanitarian [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=347.76s)]
*  situation in Gaza. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=353.76s)]
*  What will Israel's response be to United States regarding these laws? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=354.76s)]
*  First of all, we respect the United States and we collaborate with the United States. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=361.76s)]
*  But I would point out to the fact that the Congress itself here in the United States [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=366.36s)]
*  decided last September to stop funding for UNRWA. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  The U.S. was the biggest donor to UNRWA. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=374.92s)]
*  They gave approximately $300 million a year to UNRWA. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=377.16s)]
*  And still the Congress voted and decided to stop funding at least until 2025. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=382.0s)]
*  So I think the congressmen who saw the evidence we shared here and other materials were knowledgeable [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=387.44s)]
*  enough to take that action. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=393.64s)]
*  And I think that if someone wants to support humanitarian efforts in Gaza, he should do [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=395.8s)]
*  it, but he can do it with other organs, not with UNRWA. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=402.48s)]
*  That will be our recommendation. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=406.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=408.16s)]
*  What kind of organization would you suggest? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=409.16s)]
*  I listed them. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=414.56s)]
*  WHO, UNICEF, World Food Program. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=415.56s)]
*  There are dozens of NGOs today that operate in Gaza and we will continue to collaborate [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=418.0s)]
*  with them. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=423.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=424.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJmE3mHnsSs&t=432.48s)]
