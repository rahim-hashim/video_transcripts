Video Description: Mr. President, Excellencies,
I am pleased to deliver the Secretary-General’s briefing on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.
His remarks are as follows:
Last December, the hostilities in Gaza and Israel -- that have created appalling human suffering, physical destruction, and collective trauma -- led to my exceptional invocation of Article 99 of the United Nations Charter. 
Seven months later, the war rages on. 
Over 38,000 Palestinians have been reported killed according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza -- with some 87,000 injured and thousands missing -- many of whom are women and children.  
Over 1,500 Israelis and foreign nationals have been reported killed according to Israeli sources -- with more than 7,000 injured and 125 hostages still held in Gaza. 
The humanitarian support system in Gaza is close to total collapse.
There is a complete breakdown of public order.
And the spectre of further regional spillover is increasing by the day, as exchanges of fire across the Blue Line between Hizbullah and Israel continue. 
Nothing can justify the horrific acts of terror committed by Hamas and other armed groups in Israel on 7 October. 
And nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
Mr. President,
In recent weeks, Israeli military operations and fighting intensified across Gaza.  Rockets continue to be launched by Palestinian armed groups from Gaza towards Israeli population centres.
Rafah is in ruins – and the Rafah crossing remains closed, further hampering humanitarian operations.
Almost two million people have been displaced– nearly the entire population of Gaza – and many of them multiple times.
Nowhere in Gaza is safe. 
Meanwhile, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification partnership reports that almost half a million people face catastrophic levels of food insecurity. 
Communicable diseases are on the rise. 
Chokeholds on the fuel-supply have severely reduced access to water, sanitation, hygiene and health services.
The United Nations remains committed to delivering lifesaving aid in Gaza. But we face severe challenges and deadly risks.
Humanitarian convoys are frequently unable to collect and distribute lifesaving goods in safety – including from the crucial Karem Abu Salem/Kerem Shalom crossing.
Attacks on humanitarian aid workers and shelters, as well as strikes on or near health and humanitarian facilities, continue. 
Lawlessness and criminality are rampant.
The parties must fundamentally and urgently change their conduct to address these challenges.  
The humanitarian notification system and other coordination mechanisms are not effective, resulting in delayed and aborted aid missions and the exposure of humanitarians to mortal risk.
The UN still does not have the necessary security equipment in Gaza to manage the extreme risks that our personnel face. 
Despite ongoing dialogue with Israeli authorities and some improvements, much more is needed.
The entry of humanitarian aid at scale, and its delivery to all parts of Gaza, are essential to the survival and wellbeing of civilians. 
We need consistent access through all crossing points and better access to those in need, wherever they are.
It is long past time for a safe enabling environment for effective humanitarian operations in Gaza, in line with international humanitarian law.   
Mr. President,
As much of the world’s attention is focused on Gaza, the occupied West Bank -- including East Jerusalem -- faces perilous conditions.
High levels of violence persist – including by Israeli security forces, settlers, and Palestinian armed groups.
Between 7 October 2023 and 17 July 2024, 557 Palestinians – including 138 children – were killed in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem; the vast majority were killed in the context of Israeli security operations, including during subsequent exchanges with Palestinian armed groups; these include 540 killed by Israeli forces, 10 by Israeli settlers, and seven where it remains unknown whether the perpetrators were Israeli forces or settlers.   
During the same period, 22 Israelis, including nine members of Israeli forces, were killed by Palestinians in Israel and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. 
Meanwhile, Israeli measures are undermining the Palestinian Authority, crippling the Palestinian economy and driving instability.
This month, the Israeli security cabinet approved a series of punitive steps against the Palestinian Authority.
The steps reportedly include the legalization, under Israeli law, of five Israeli outposts in the occupied West Bank, the advancement of thousands of settlement housing units, and demolitions in parts of Area B in the occupied West Bank.
At the same time, the Israeli Finance Minister lifted the suspension of the transfer to the Palestinian Authority of partial clearance revenues. These revenues are collected by Israel on behalf of the Palestinians.

*  released and this terrible war must end. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aElefoi7d4&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  We must refocus on finding a political solution that will end the occupation and resolve the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aElefoi7d4&t=616.24s)]
*  conflict in line with international law and relevant United Nations resolutions. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aElefoi7d4&t=621.76s)]
*  Ensuring that governance is restored in Gaza under a single legitimate Palestinian government [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aElefoi7d4&t=628.44s)]
