# Gaza: UN Chief's Media Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q)
*  Good afternoon. The Secretary General will make some remarks and then we'll take a few [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  questions. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=7.0s)]
*  More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza. No food, no fuel, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=9.4s)]
*  no medicine, no commercial supplies. As aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  dried up. Gaza is a killing field and civilians are in an endless death loop. Certain truths [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=27.4s)]
*  are clear since the atrocious October 7 terror attacks by Hamas. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=35.92s)]
*  Above all, we know ceasefires work. The ceasefire allowed for the release of hostages. The ceasefire [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=41.68s)]
*  ensured the distribution of life-saving aid. The ceasefire proved that the humanitarian [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=49.0s)]
*  community can deliver. For weeks, guns fell silent, obstacles were removed, looting ended, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=54.8s)]
*  and we were able to deliver life-saving supplies to virtually every part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=66.36s)]
*  That all ended with the shattering of the ceasefire. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=73.2s)]
*  Hope sunk for Palestinian families in Gaza and families of hostages in Israel. And I [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=78.16s)]
*  was reminded yesterday when I met again with hostage families. And that is why I have consistently [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=84.64s)]
*  been pushing for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, a permanent ceasefire, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=93.36s)]
*  and full humanitarian access. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=100.0s)]
*  In times like these, we must be crystal clear. Clear about the situation. With crossing points [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  into Gaza shut and aid blockaded, security is in shambles and our capacity to deliver [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=110.83999999999999s)]
*  has been strangled. And as the heads of UN humanitarian organizations declared in a joint [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=117.36s)]
*  statement yesterday, and I quote, assertions that there is now enough food to feed all [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=123.44s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza are far from the reality on the ground and commodities are running [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=130.44s)]
*  extremely low. End of quote. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=140.84s)]
*  We must also be clear about the obligations. As the occupying power, Israel has unequivocal [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=144.64s)]
*  obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=151.8s)]
*  human rights law. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=158.28s)]
*  Article 55, paragraph 1st of the forced Geneva Convention provides that, and I quote, the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=161.32s)]
*  occupying power is the duty of ensuring food and medical supplies of the population. End [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=168.76s)]
*  of quote. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=176.04s)]
*  Article 56, paragraph 1 of the forced Geneva Convention provides that, and I quote, the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=178.28s)]
*  occupying power is the duty of ensuring and maintaining the medical and hospital establishments [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=186.2s)]
*  and services, public health and hygiene in the occupied territory. End of quote. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=192.08s)]
*  It further states that medical personnel of all categories shall be allowed to carry out [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=200.04s)]
*  their duties. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=204.72s)]
*  And article 59, paragraph 1st of the forced Geneva Convention provides that, and I quote, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=207.0s)]
*  if the whole or part of the population of an occupied territory is inadequately supplied, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=215.52s)]
*  the occupying power shall agree to relief schemes on behalf of the said population that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=222.12s)]
*  shall facilitate them by all means at its disposal. End of quote. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=229.0s)]
*  None of that is happening today. No humanitarian supplies can enter Gaza. Meanwhile, at the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=236.32s)]
*  crossing points, food, medicine and shelter supplies are piling up and vital equipment [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  is stuck. International humanitarian law also includes the obligation to respect humanitarian [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=250.64s)]
*  relief personnel. And I want to say a special word about those humanitarian heroes in Gaza. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=257.68s)]
*  They are under fire and yet doing all they can to follow the path they choose to help [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=265.4s)]
*  people. UN agencies and our partners are ready and determined to deliver. But Israeli [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=271.6s)]
*  authorities newly proposed authorization mechanisms for aid delivery risk further controlling [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  and callously limiting aid down to the last calorie and grain of flour. Let me be clear, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=286.76000000000005s)]
*  we will not participate in any arrangement that does not fully respect the humanitarian [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=293.76s)]
*  principles, humanitarian, humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality. An impeded humanitarian [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=303.0s)]
*  access must be guaranteed and humanitarian personnel must be given the protection that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=312.56s)]
*  they are accorded under international law. The inviolability of United Nations premises [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  and assets must be respected. And I call once again for an independent investigation into [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=324.6s)]
*  the killing of humanitarians, including UN personnel. We must stick to our core principles. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=330.56s)]
*  Member states of the United Nations must adhere to their obligations and their international [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=337.8s)]
*  law. There must be justice and accountability when they do not. The world may be running [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=342.42s)]
*  out of words to describe the situation in Gaza, but we will never run away from the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=349.42s)]
*  truth. The current past is a dead end, totally intolerable in the eyes of international law [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=354.26s)]
*  and history. And the risk of the occupied West Bank transforming into another Gaza makes [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=362.1s)]
*  it even worse. It is time to end the dehumanization, to protect civilians, release the hostages, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=368.54s)]
*  ensuring life-saving aid and renew the ceasefire. Thank you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=377.62s)]
*  Thank you for the opportunity. Secretary General, this is Sheree Fitcheson from Honorable Agency. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=387.94s)]
*  I actually have a question about the press conference between Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=392.02000000000004s)]
*  and President Trump yesterday. If you may recall, they once again reiterated President [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=396.26s)]
*  Trump's vision to relocate the Gazans to countries who are willing to take them. So I just want [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=403.42s)]
*  to know if you think this is forced displacement and isn't that a war crime? And if I may just [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  ask one additional question, Prime Minister Netanyahu actually in a rather pitiful way [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=415.18s)]
*  said that the Gazan people are locked in Gaza. And I just want to know in your opinion who [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=421.5s)]
*  is locking the Gazan people in there? For example, is the UN able to carry out urgent [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=427.58s)]
*  medical evacuations if they want to? Is this a possibility right now in Gaza? Thank you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=433.58000000000004s)]
*  Palestinians must be able to live in a Palestinian state side by side with the other countries [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=441.94s)]
*  side by side with an Israeli state. That is the only solution that can be increased to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=451.54s)]
*  the Middle East. Medical evacuations are absolutely essential and everything must be done to increase [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=458.54s)]
*  the number of medical evacuations. And forced displacement? Sorry? Forced displacement, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=464.82s)]
*  I mean sending the Gazan people to other countries? As I said, Palestinians have the right to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=470.18s)]
*  live in Palestine in a Palestinian state side by side with Israeli states. To be forced [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=475.78s)]
*  to be moved away is something that is against international law. Thank you very much Mr. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=484.14s)]
*  Secretary General. As I'm sure you have been reading, President Trump has imposed widespread [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=491.29999999999995s)]
*  tariffs on almost every country in the world. I wonder if you could give us your reaction [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=499.3s)]
*  to this and are you concerned that this could lead to a global economic recession? I've [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=510.02000000000004s)]
*  been clarifying my position about this issue time and time again. Trade wars, trade wars, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=519.82s)]
*  are extremely negative. Nobody wins with a trade war. Everybody tends to lose. And I'm [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=528.8599999999999s)]
*  particularly worried with the most vulnerable developing countries in which the impact will [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=538.5799999999999s)]
*  be more devastating. I sincerely hope that we will have no recession because a recession [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=546.3399999999999s)]
*  will have dramatic consequences, especially for the poorest people in the world. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=554.34s)]
*  Mr. Secretary General, Gabriel Elizondo from Al Jazeera English. In your remarks just now [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=562.34s)]
*  you said the world may be running out of words to describe the situation in Gaza. However, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=567.1s)]
*  much of the world does have a word to describe what's happening in Gaza and that word is [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=574.22s)]
*  genocide. You have been consistent over the last 18 months that you feel it's up to a [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=578.3s)]
*  relevant international court to determine if a genocide is taking place in Gaza. However, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=583.74s)]
*  my question sir is do you understand how so many people around the world do look at what's [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=589.2199999999999s)]
*  happening in Gaza as a genocide? I think that the situation is sufficiently horrible not [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=594.66s)]
*  to be worried with the semantics. There is a competence of the International Court of [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=600.66s)]
*  Justice and the International Court of Justice was seized exactly in relation to that. And [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=606.46s)]
*  the International Court of Justice is a body of the UN and I respect the decisions of the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=612.7s)]
*  International Court of Justice. But as I said, the situation is absolutely horrible. There [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=618.34s)]
*  is no doubt about that. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=625.1s)]
*  Thank you Mr. Secretary General Abdul Hamid Al-Siyama from the Arabic Daily Al-Quds Al-Arabi. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=630.62s)]
*  Mr. Secretary General you keep saying nothing justifies October 7. You keep repeating that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=635.62s)]
*  all the time that nothing justifies what happened on October 7. Is there anything justifies [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=641.58s)]
*  56 years of occupation? Is there anything justifies the settlement activities? Is there [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=648.02s)]
*  anything justifies bulldozing many thousands of Palestinian homes? Is there anything justifies [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=653.86s)]
*  the invasion of Jerusalem and not allowing Palestinians to go to the Holy Mosque? Why [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=660.1800000000001s)]
*  you keep repeating that as if history started on October 7? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=666.7s)]
*  If you listen carefully to what I say, I always say when I say nothing justifies the October [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=671.22s)]
*  7 horrible terror attacks by Hamas, I always add that nothing justifies the terror attacks [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=682.74s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. And all the things that you have been described correspond exactly [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=689.94s)]
*  to the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=697.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=700.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=701.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=702.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXr3icpDE2Q&t=703.6600000000001s)]
