Video Description: World Health Organization (WHO) senior official in Gaza Rik Peeperkorn said that the health needs in the Strip are “immense” as functional health facilities and services are scarce.

Peeperkorn today (06 Feb) spoke to reporters from Gaza via video link.

On mental health, the WHO senior official said that that everyone in Gaza is affected by the conflict, with stress, anxiety, depression and feel of loneliness. He said that only two psychiatrists are in the north and a few mental health professionals.

Peeperkorn also said that WHO started a training program. “As of now, 44 mental health humanitarian workers were trained on psychological first aid to provide immediate emotional and psychological support early and also ensure early detection and enable safe referrals.”

On a positive note, the WHO official said that Shifa Hospital “bounced back in the middle of the severe destruction, some departments are working, and it's working again as a referral hospital.”

He said that WHO is supporting an emergency medical team. “There's general surgery going on, trauma surgery going on, and more in child health. A lot is going on. And also some substantial renovations to expand the impatience department and the ICU,” Peeperkorn added.
On medical evacuation, the WHO official said, “There should be more patients going through Rafah into Egypt. But we also want other medical corridors, and the first medical corridors we really want to see restored is the traditional referral pathway to West Bank and East Jerusalem. The hospitals are ready in East Jerusalem and West Bank to receive the patients.”

Asked about the recent announcement on US withdrawing from his Organization, Peeperkorn said, “We need a strong World Health Organization which plays a crucial role in protecting the health security of the world people, including Americans, and addressing the root causes of disease, but also building stronger health systems, detecting, preventing and responding to health emergencies, including disease outbreaks, often in dangerous places where we of us cannot go.”

“And therefore, we really hope for this reconsideration and look forward to engaging in this constructive dialog, at all levels,” he concluded.

*  So let me focus on health. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=40.64s)]
*  So my name is Dr. Rick Peepercorn. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=42.0s)]
*  I'm a WHO representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=43.0s)]
*  I've been in this almost for four years and also before the crisis came to Gaza every [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=47.24s)]
*  And since the crisis actually from November 23 onwards, every second month I've been in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=55.12s)]
*  Gaza for a couple of weeks, sometimes two, sometimes three, sometimes four weeks during [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=60.72s)]
*  the polio campaign, et cetera. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  And I'm here now for the last two weeks. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  Let me tell you something about the visits we made, especially in the South, in Rafa [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=72.8s)]
*  and in the North, in Jabalia. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=77.32s)]
*  Of course, the health needs focusing on health, they are immense. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=80.56s)]
*  The functional health facilities are scarce. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  We still talk about 18 of the 36 hospitals partly functional and roughly one third, 55 [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  of the 143 primary health care centers, partly functional, 11 field hospitals, operational. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=94.2s)]
*  Total bed capacity is 1900. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=101.16s)]
*  It used to be before the crisis more than three and a half thousand, 13 and 70 inpatients [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=103.08s)]
*  bed and very few ICU beds and incubators. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=109.16s)]
*  To say something about mental health, maybe start something different is that everyone [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza is affected by this 15, 16 months conflict. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, literally everyone, including my staff, the stress, anxiety, kind of feeling of loneliness, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=121.8s)]
*  depression, et cetera, all over. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=130.32000000000002s)]
*  If you look at the number of psychiatrists, only two in the North and a few mental health [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=132.4s)]
*  professionals. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=138.28s)]
*  Before the war, mental health was already, I say, an issue, but there was a psychiatric [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=139.28s)]
*  hospital, number six community mental health kind of centers and a good NGO network for [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  that as well. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=151.24s)]
*  That's all came to a halt, either destroyed, not working. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=152.4s)]
*  The police fire, of course, the bad thing, whatever happened to us and then allowing [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=157.2s)]
*  WHO to scale up health response. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=161.48s)]
*  Since that, we received, I think, more than one and two, one and five now trucks coming [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=165.48s)]
*  from the North and the South. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=169.28s)]
*  We dispatched, we had already stocked up on some supplies and we dispatched supplies to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  cover the needs for more than one and a six million people. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=175.64s)]
*  Now in the North, you heard probably more than 560,000 people cross towards Gaza. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=179.2s)]
*  North Gaza is probably more than over a million now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=186.8s)]
*  If you look at the North of Gaza and then we came back, especially in the months of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=189.92s)]
*  October, November, December, WHO was constantly trying to reach and we reached Kamalat I and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=194.68s)]
*  Al-Adha, Indonesia, to bring fuel, supplies, EMTs, et cetera. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=201.04s)]
*  Currently there's only one hospital we made sparkly functional, Al-Adha, with a lot of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=207.08s)]
*  Kamalat I is completely destroyed, burned out and recognizable for a lot. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  Chabalia is like a wasteland. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  The destruction is incredibly, it's beyond belief. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  We knew this. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=231.04s)]
*  I've been there so often, but when you see it, it was a beautiful sunny day and when [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=232.04s)]
*  you see that around you, it's a wasteland. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  This hospital, the other hospital there, Indonesian hospital, not functional, the infrastructure [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=240.68s)]
*  more or less intact, for the rest also a lot of damage and everything gone. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=247.8s)]
*  You don't only talk about hospitals when you want to run hospitals, but also, for example, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=253.12s)]
*  the generators, the desalination plant, oxygen plants, et cetera, all destroyed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=257.96s)]
*  There's already plants there from the partners, the WHO, the ministry and the partners to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=265.11999999999995s)]
*  some sites cleared around Kamalat I to get a kind of polyclinic, think primary healthcare, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=272.2s)]
*  establish a trauma stabilization point because people are coming back also in Chabalia. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=278.55999999999995s)]
*  We see people there, they come to their mostly destroyed or severely damaged houses. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  They put up a kind of makeshift shelter for children, women, men, et cetera. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=290.72s)]
*  First thing, of course, they need is shelter, wash, but also like this basic house facilities. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=295.28s)]
*  Gaza City is of course expanding rapidly. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=302.32s)]
*  We are trying to help. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=309.2s)]
*  Shiva Hospital, we are expanding to and at that, what is being planned. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=310.2s)]
*  We are going on for Indonesian hospital to help and restore its restorations. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=316.4s)]
*  Also we try to get in a prefab facility for Gaza City. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  Surgical teams already deployed actually in Al-Akhli and the public aid hospital. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=326.44s)]
*  It's impressive, by the way, and something positive if you go to Shiva Hospital and we [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=332.36s)]
*  all know that all these hospitals, they became non-functional, nothing happened, they bounced [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=336.64s)]
*  back. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=343.28s)]
*  In the middle of the severe destruction, some departments are working and it's working again [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=344.35999999999996s)]
*  as a referral hospital. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=348.76s)]
*  So we show support to an emergency medical team, a national emergency medical team. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=350.23999999999995s)]
*  There's general surgery going on, trauma surgery going on, and modern child health, ops and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  guinea et cetera. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=362.88s)]
*  So a lot is going on. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=363.88s)]
*  And also some substantial renovations to expand the inpatient department and the ICU. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=365.52s)]
*  Disease surveillance, we need to really expand now and the whole area of public health intelligence [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=374.84s)]
*  as well. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=382.0s)]
*  Then let me say a few words about Rafa because that's of course another area where people [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=383.0s)]
*  could go back to. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=386.76s)]
*  Also Rafa, the buildings are smaller and so it's the same scale, it's the same kind of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=390.64s)]
*  wasteland as in Jabalia, wide scale destruction and mainly from residential buildings, including [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  by the way our WHO guest house. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=406.08s)]
*  The bedroom I can recognize by the way, completely flattened. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=408.64s)]
*  I don't understand, it was a de-conflicted building. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  The healthcare lifeline has been really severe. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=418.92s)]
*  It's like in Rafa, before the siege in Rafa, we helped to take away as much as possible [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  equipment and bring it to other places. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  The three hospitals there, the three hospitals, the Al-Najjar, the Emirati MCH and the Kuwaiti [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=431.88000000000005s)]
*  hospital are all non-functional. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=442.56s)]
*  They have been non-functional all the time since then. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=443.92s)]
*  The Al-Najjar severely damaged in France and in the backwards, complete mass will be difficult [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=448.44s)]
*  to restore. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=453.24s)]
*  The MCH hospital, the famous MCH hospital, which maybe you remember, WHO actually transferred [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=454.24s)]
*  the 33 babies from Shefa to there, even in that hospital, very sad to see, the neonatology [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=462.84s)]
*  ward incubators, almost everything is destroyed and shut up. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=469.76s)]
*  That maternal and child hospital is not functional. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=476.04s)]
*  The other hospital we cannot really because it was in the buffer zone. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=479.36s)]
*  But also there you see people coming back and again the same as Jibalia, camping between [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=482.96s)]
*  the ruins. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=487.88s)]
*  Same plans for there to get a trauma stabilization point and some sort of primary healthcare. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=490.44s)]
*  Last one, Medevac. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=497.64s)]
*  Medevac, I think, has been starting and I think that's part of the agreement to maximum [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=500.11999999999995s)]
*  50 critical patients daily. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=506.11999999999995s)]
*  Now I was on the third Medevac. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=510.35999999999996s)]
*  It's a long process. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=511.67999999999995s)]
*  So all these days it's not reached the 50, but like 36, 37, 38, 39 patients plus their [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=513.0s)]
*  companions. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=519.6s)]
*  And this is incredibly important that we expedite this and we speed this up because we have [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=520.6s)]
*  estimated at WHO that between 12 and 14,000 patients are in need for Medevac out of Gaza. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=528.32s)]
*  Half of them trauma, half of them related to war, half of them chronic disease, oncology, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=534.48s)]
*  cardiovascular, et cetera. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=539.5200000000001s)]
*  Of these 12 to 14,000 patients, we estimate at least 5,000 are children. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=541.24s)]
*  So what we actually pushed all along, great that RAFA is crossing this opening, but we [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=546.44s)]
*  need to expedite. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=554.48s)]
*  There should be more patients going through RAFA into Egypt. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=555.48s)]
*  But we also, we want other medical corridors. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=559.44s)]
*  And the first medical corridors we really want to see restored is the traditional referral [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=561.52s)]
*  pathway to West Bank and East Jerusalem. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=566.64s)]
*  The hospitals are ready in East Jerusalem and West Bank to receive the patients. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=568.96s)]
*  Now a few words on the West Bank and I think what Mansthal had concerning due to the operation [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=574.52s)]
*  also have an impact on health and healthcare. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=581.16s)]
*  We tried to do the WHO preposition supplies in key hospitals, work on mass casualty management [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=585.4000000000001s)]
*  training. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  We had already a trauma care program in place in the West Bank and indeed provides emergency [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  stocks. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=598.96s)]
*  I'm going to leave it there. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=599.96s)]
*  Over to you. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=600.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=601.96s)]
*  I'll now turn the floor over to questions. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=602.96s)]
*  First question goes to Edith Lederer. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=605.2800000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much Dr. Pieperkorn on behalf of the United Nations Correspondence Association [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=609.88s)]
*  for doing this briefing. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=617.0s)]
*  My name is Edith Lederer from the Associated Press. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=619.76s)]
*  Could you give us a little broader update on medical evacuations? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=626.52s)]
*  How many are waiting now? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=632.4s)]
*  How critical they are? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=635.4s)]
*  And could you also tell us the impact of the United States withdrawal from WHO on your [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=638.16s)]
*  work and what you're hearing because you're in Gaza and we're not from people there about [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=650.52s)]
*  President Trump's announcement that he wants the population of Gaza to be evacuated, the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=662.84s)]
*  US to take over and turn it into the Riviera of the Mideast. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=673.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=679.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=680.52s)]
*  Let me start with Medevac. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=681.52s)]
*  So before the RAFA crossing was closed, that was in 6 May, because I remember I was in [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=688.44s)]
*  Gaza, 6 May 2024. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=699.96s)]
*  Approximately 4,800, 4,900 patients had been medevaced into Egypt and from Egypt, I think [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=706.4000000000001s)]
*  Egypt and for the rest a lot in the region, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Turkey, and then I think [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=715.0s)]
*  a few to Europe from there. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=721.92s)]
*  Since the crossing closed on the 6 May, only 480 patients have been medevaced. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=724.64s)]
*  That has been all managed and supported by WHO. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=732.0s)]
*  So we did already the internal medevac from the north to other hospitals on all those [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=735.64s)]
*  missions, et cetera. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=740.1600000000001s)]
*  When we brought fuel, medical supplies, EMTs, we got patients out on numerous of those missions [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=741.1600000000001s)]
*  to other places. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=749.2s)]
*  480. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=751.2s)]
*  And we constantly raised, and that went through Qam Shalom and then to Ramon Airport and then [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=752.2s)]
*  for them a lot to the UAE and to a number of other places, including some Europeans, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=758.76s)]
*  a few to Jordan and the US. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=764.0400000000001s)]
*  We raised already then. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=767.5200000000001s)]
*  We have to speed this up. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=769.08s)]
*  We will be, if we continue like that, that pace, we will be medevacking for the next [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=770.08s)]
*  five to 10 years. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=774.24s)]
*  And in the meantime, people and some of the critical patients, including children, because [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=776.84s)]
*  they couldn't be medevaced, they were dying. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=782.08s)]
*  So it was a real urgent plea. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=784.96s)]
*  We also then already said we need to expand that and we need to get back to this traditional [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=788.24s)]
*  pathway to the East Jerusalem hospitals and the West Bank. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=794.04s)]
*  Because before this crisis, between 50 and 100 patients per day were referred to the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=797.9599999999999s)]
*  East Jerusalem hospitals and the West Bank. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=804.56s)]
*  That was not trauma then. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=807.92s)]
*  It was mainly oncology and it was oncology and a little cardiovascular and other more [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=808.92s)]
*  complex specialties which could be treated in Gaza. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=816.04s)]
*  Now we also had a good overview of this 480 patients of which half, with WHO actually [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=820.2s)]
*  medevac, of which half were children, more or less, that the major reasons for the medevac [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=827.4000000000001s)]
*  were either trauma or oncology. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=836.0400000000001s)]
*  And then there were some other congenital diseases, et cetera. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=839.1600000000001s)]
*  There were some other areas. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=843.32s)]
*  Now currently, the Karim Shalom, there's no medevac anymore through that one. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=845.88s)]
*  It's only through RAFA. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=852.96s)]
*  And according to the ceasefire agreement, it should be at least try with maximum 50 [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=856.04s)]
*  patients per day. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=863.12s)]
*  So it was only started last Sunday. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=864.12s)]
*  I was there with the team. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=867.16s)]
*  So we got to just describe that we got one group of patients from Shefa, from the North, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=869.84s)]
*  another group from Nasr Metal Complex where they were collected and got them through the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=875.44s)]
*  border. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=880.32s)]
*  Then, in my view, way too complex and long screening process still takes place there. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=881.32s)]
*  I mean, it takes a long time for 37 patients and their companions. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=887.7600000000001s)]
*  It took almost seven or eight hours to manage that. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=891.48s)]
*  So that also needs to be improved and that mechanism needs to be improved and much quicker. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=897.0400000000001s)]
*  We also stress again, I want to stress again, we need more medical corridors. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=904.12s)]
*  And that's why we made this plea, which is not yet allowed. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=908.22s)]
*  I hope it will be considered to get another medical corridor, for example, through the [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=911.44s)]
*  north of Gaza, through Aris back to East Jerusalem and to the West Bank hospitals. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=916.36s)]
*  And then you could say from both Egypt and from the East Jerusalem and West Bank, when [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=924.92s)]
*  third countries could, you know, when they're ready to receive patients, we get patients [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=931.0s)]
*  from there. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=936.2s)]
*  That is the idea. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=937.2s)]
*  We are ready for that to facilitate a support that is much as possible. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=938.2s)]
*  Now you asked about the difficult question on the impacts of the US fundings, et cetera. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=942.8s)]
*  Well, first of all, I want to say also on a personal note, of course, that we hope that [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=952.6s)]
*  this is still being reviewed and reconsidered because I think the statement from the WHO [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=958.4s)]
*  has been clear, regrets that announcement of the intention to withdraw from the organization. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=963.48s)]
*  And we need a strong World Health Organization, which plays a crucial role in protecting the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=969.48s)]
*  health security of the world people, including Americans, addressing the root causes of disease, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=977.5600000000001s)]
*  but also building stronger health system, detecting, preventing and responding to health [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=982.8s)]
*  emergencies, including disease outbreaks, often in dangerous places where others cannot [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=988.24s)]
*  go. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=994.76s)]
*  And therefore we really hope for this reconsideration and look forward to engaging in this constructive [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=995.88s)]
*  dialogue at all levels, which we always did. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1002.52s)]
*  And like I worked with the US all the time. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1005.68s)]
*  I was seven and a half years wrapped in Afghanistan. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1009.96s)]
*  And I even want to make this even a bit personal. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1012.28s)]
*  Like I've been a medical doctor, but I also graduated from the Johns Hopkins School of [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1017.32s)]
*  Public Health. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1024.36s)]
*  And the US has an array of really strong public health schools. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1025.96s)]
*  Hopkins, Harvard, Emory, Berkeley, Tulane, you name it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1031.08s)]
*  But also we worked, of course, when I worked in the field, Africa and Asia, a lot with [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1035.28s)]
*  the CDC, very strong National Institutes of Health, et cetera. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1039.84s)]
*  And that should be part of that. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1043.3999999999999s)]
*  If you talk global health, you talk global health security, you really, we should focus [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1044.8s)]
*  on collaboration and not on isolation. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1053.3999999999999s)]
*  And we need all, everyone on board and specifically the US. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1056.9599999999998s)]
*  So I really hope that somehow will be reconsidered. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1063.48s)]
*  If you ask on the direct impacts, like in OPT, we have an array of partners and donors, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1067.1200000000001s)]
*  fortunately, with a group of 30 partners. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1072.96s)]
*  But I quickly looked at what it would mean for, for example, for the Palestinian territory [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1076.16s)]
*  and Lebanon. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1082.32s)]
*  And then the US in this counts to almost 30%, like with 67 million there of emergency, when [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1083.6s)]
*  we look at emergency operations. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1091.76s)]
*  So that is substantial and massive. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1093.76s)]
*  And that's just now. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1096.24s)]
*  We are now still in the humanitarian phase, but we are already starting early recovering, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1097.8799999999999s)]
*  rehabilitation and reconstruction, where for much more is needed for health overall. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1103.2s)]
*  And I think hopefully we get the figures later in the coming weeks from the UN World Bank [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1109.04s)]
*  to end the UN, to really get a better overview of what is needed. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1115.24s)]
*  So we need everyone on board. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1121.84s)]
*  Your last questions are very difficult to address and give an answer. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1123.5600000000002s)]
*  I think my colleague already did that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1127.5600000000002s)]
*  Over to you. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1130.3600000000001s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1131.3600000000001s)]

*  You touched on mental health at the top of your remarks. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1139.8400000000001s)]
*  I was just wondering if you could talk to us a bit more about it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1143.24s)]
*  I imagine probably the entire population of Gaza has PTSD of some sort. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1145.88s)]
*  And you talked to us about what WHO is doing to treat adults and children who are suffering [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1151.76s)]
*  from this. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1158.0s)]
*  And how many medical professionals are left in Gaza that you're aware of, Palestinian [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1159.16s)]
*  medical professionals? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1163.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1165.56s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1169.56s)]
*  I think on mental health, what we already, I think first of all, you're completely right. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1170.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, everyone is affected. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1179.52s)]
*  But of course, some groups are more affected than others. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1181.76s)]
*  So we have to always look to these more vulnerable groups. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1184.26s)]
*  And the more vulnerable groups in this case are the children, I would say, the young, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1187.6s)]
*  the adolescents, maybe women even more than men, et cetera. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1193.84s)]
*  So that's one part. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1198.76s)]
*  And of course, also other vulnerable groups in Gaza. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1199.76s)]
*  Though we have to look to all. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1206.24s)]
*  What also is a specific group are the humanitarian workers, not the internationals, but health [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1207.88s)]
*  workers. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1217.88s)]
*  So having been working here for four years, and specifically in the health fields, and [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1219.32s)]
*  looking at the resilience from the Gaza health workers, but also first of all, they're all [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1226.16s)]
*  just as affected as anyone. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1231.76s)]
*  And including myself, I think they all have witnessed scenes from incredible cruelty and [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1234.48s)]
*  which they will probably, yeah, they all will have to cope with it somehow. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1243.08s)]
*  So also helping the helpers. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1248.3s)]
*  So first of all, WHO, we tried to get it also. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1250.4s)]
*  What was the problem? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1254.16s)]
*  There was no, okay, the mental health hospital was destroyed. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1256.08s)]
*  The community health centers were also destroyed, were non-functional. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1260.84s)]
*  There were very few psychiatrists actually in Gaza. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1266.0s)]
*  It was already not the strongest area of the health fields. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1269.6s)]
*  We were just actually starting to integrate mental health in primary health care, also [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1274.0s)]
*  in Gaza, and in referral hospitals. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1278.8799999999999s)]
*  What was strong in Gaza on mental health, there were some really strong NGOs working [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1283.28s)]
*  with the communities and at schools, not just with WHO. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1288.92s)]
*  You want to mention UNICEF there as well. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1294.0s)]
*  I mean, like there was a lot of work going on. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1295.92s)]
*  So what has happened now, there is, again, the Ministry of Health, WHO, and the partners [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1299.72s)]
*  here in Gaza, they looked from the start on what is a minimum health package we can provide [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1306.88s)]
*  and made sure that also some basic mental health is included. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1313.4s)]
*  Some of the medical points, primary health care points, this is already happening. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1319.12s)]
*  And also in some of the hospitals, for example, European Gaza hospitals, which we are supporting. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1322.8s)]
*  We brought in the psychotropics for people who would need psychotropics and we're constantly [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1329.1599999999999s)]
*  doing that. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1334.04s)]
*  I mean, WHO provides almost 80% of the supplies in health. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1335.04s)]
*  So we also did that. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1339.1999999999998s)]
*  Difficult to get in sometimes, through time. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1341.1999999999998s)]
*  And also we started training programs of late, 44 mental health, humanitarian health workers [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1344.46s)]
*  were trained on psychological first aid to provide this immediate emotional and psychological [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1350.3400000000001s)]
*  support and also ensure early detection and enable safe referrals, promote resilience. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1356.3400000000001s)]
*  I know that UNICEF is doing work with UNRWA in the schools and at least the learning centers, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1362.9s)]
*  that's what it's called, as well in these areas. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1371.3400000000001s)]
*  But I think when the ceasefire holds, that's the biggest thing, of course, it has to hold [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1374.42s)]
*  and transfer into a peace process. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1379.46s)]
*  This is an area we have to tackle differently and much more creatively and not just in the [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1383.54s)]
*  medical field. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1388.66s)]
*  Yes, you need mental health integration at all levels of health care. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1389.66s)]
*  So that is definitely an issue and that's absolutely not there. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1393.6200000000001s)]
*  So that will be massive amount of work. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1397.38s)]
*  We need to see much more creatively at schools, in communities, etc. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1399.7s)]
*  Community approach and we have to look really at different approaches. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1404.78s)]
*  And of course, we hope that some of those NGOs and NGO work come back. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1409.74s)]
*  And then just on the number of doctors and medical professionals that are left in Gaza [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1415.22s)]
*  after the war, what's the WHO's estimate? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1419.26s)]
*  Difficult to estimate because I think before the war, there was almost 25,000 health workers [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1423.3s)]
*  and I think I've mentioned that I think there was 5,000 medical doctors, 10,000, 12,000 [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1430.54s)]
*  nurses and midwives. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1437.6999999999998s)]
*  And unfortunately, especially in the first six months, a lot of what I would say the [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1440.1399999999999s)]
*  top medical specialists left Gaza. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1447.82s)]
*  And that's why maybe you remember that we have had these horrible reflections that I [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1450.7399999999998s)]
*  remember when I was in December in 23 in January in Al-Akhli hospital where you had [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1457.3799999999999s)]
*  really good surgeons doing their work and with horrible trauma all around. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1463.94s)]
*  But they lacked, for example, a vascular surgeon. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1469.8999999999999s)]
*  And that's why they had to do even more amputations than they normally even needed to do. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1473.1s)]
*  And this is what you hear. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1478.6599999999999s)]
*  And just in Nasir Medical, you meet only the only thoracic surgeon actually in the whole [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1479.66s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1488.26s)]
*  There's some other things here. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1489.26s)]
*  Like if you talk about medical imaging, you talk about one operational CT scan and maybe [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1490.7s)]
*  one MRI for the whole of Gaza. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1496.66s)]
*  So those are really oncology. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1499.66s)]
*  Oncology is a big issue. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1503.78s)]
*  And I think because we focus so much on trauma, we forget the non-commonical diseases. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1504.8999999999999s)]
*  And when it is not war, the non-commonical diseases, cardiovascular oncology, diabetes, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1510.1s)]
*  et cetera, are the biggest killers. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1514.54s)]
*  And in that area, I mean, there has been a lot of indirect deaths in Gaza as well. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1516.82s)]
*  Now especially on oncology, what was also an area we were, before the crisis, we were [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1523.7s)]
*  working on to try to establish an oncology center in Gaza. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1528.3799999999999s)]
*  We get oncology drugs in and there's some chemotherapy, et cetera, but it is very limited. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1535.6200000000001s)]
*  There's no proper oncologist. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1542.54s)]
*  So we try to get also specialized medical teams in which can focus on that. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1544.18s)]
*  For that, again, you need a ceasefire with holes and then I would say a peace process. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1550.06s)]
*  Also in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, there is Palestinian medical specialists who [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1558.98s)]
*  have that expertise, oncologists and others, and they are really willing to come as national [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1565.14s)]
*  emergency medical teams. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1570.8600000000001s)]
*  We would love to see that and facilitate that. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1572.22s)]
*  Currently not allowed. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1575.1s)]
*  Over to you. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1576.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1577.1s)]
*  My name is Ibtisam Azam, Al Arab Al Jadid newspaper. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1578.1s)]
*  I have a quick follow-up. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1583.74s)]
*  You said that there are medical personnel who left Gaza, but we know also about medical [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1586.1399999999999s)]
*  personnel in Gaza who were killed by Israeli strikes directly or indirectly and others [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1592.74s)]
*  were arrested, died in Israeli prisons. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1597.4199999999998s)]
*  So do you have any numbers on how many people working in the medical field in Gaza were [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1599.94s)]
*  killed? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1605.86s)]
*  And also in that context, any updates on the faith of Dr. Abu Safi who is in Israeli prisons? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1606.86s)]
*  And my question is about which supplies, whether medicine, machines, whatever, you need desperately [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1616.1799999999998s)]
*  for your operations and still not allowed to get in or getting not enough in? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1630.6999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1639.9799999999998s)]
*  OK. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1641.94s)]
*  I think on your first question, I think I don't have those figures now, but WHO, we [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1642.94s)]
*  have a mandated report on tax on health care, and we do this regularly. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1650.06s)]
*  And maybe I will ask somebody to send some of the most updated data on that. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1655.78s)]
*  I want to make that point. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1662.34s)]
*  So we are mandated to analyze and then to report on attacks on health care by the World [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1665.06s)]
*  Health Assembly. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1681.34s)]
*  And in Gaza, I think up until now, we've verified 670 attacks that resulted in 886 fatalities [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1682.34s)]
*  and 1,355 injuries. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1694.8999999999999s)]
*  So attacks affected 122 health facilities and one of the 70 ambulances. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1697.8999999999999s)]
*  Now WHO, we don't attribute the tax, I mean, where and how, because I also want to say [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1705.1399999999999s)]
*  we are not a crime investigating bureau. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1713.26s)]
*  We are the World Health Organization. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1717.62s)]
*  That's the mandate we have. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1719.6999999999998s)]
*  And we, on attacks on health care, that's the mandate. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1720.6999999999998s)]
*  I don't know, I think we have, I think WHO have often raised their concerns about all [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1725.3s)]
*  detained health workers, including Dr. Osamu, I know personally, because I went often to [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1733.78s)]
*  command one. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1739.22s)]
*  And I think not only myself, Dr. Taitlos, many others have raised that constantly. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1740.22s)]
*  We have no information over to you. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1746.1399999999999s)]
*  And on the needs, it's an array, I think it's an array on these. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1750.1399999999999s)]
*  By the way, I just want to say on the data I just mentioned, on the attacks and the deaths. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1757.1399999999999s)]
*  So this is attacks on health care. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1768.82s)]
*  That is not just health workers, it includes doctors and it includes civilians as well [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1772.4599999999998s)]
*  who might have included patients. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1778.18s)]
*  So we do not disaggregate and including on the nature of the injuries as well. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1781.22s)]
*  Maybe that should be specific. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1788.22s)]
*  Now on the health needs in every field, they are, I would say enormous. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1790.82s)]
*  If you look even from areas of essential medicines, there's still needs, but I think we're doing [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1796.98s)]
*  a little better in that area. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1802.74s)]
*  What we will really have to be working on when you talk early recovery and rehabilitation [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1807.3000000000002s)]
*  is of course all the building materials, et cetera, for that. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1813.3000000000002s)]
*  But also what we struggled with was generators, large generators for hospitals, et cetera, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1816.98s)]
*  the spare parts, et cetera. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1822.5800000000002s)]
*  When you go, when we would move into a phase, and we all hope, pray for that, we go to the [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1825.0600000000002s)]
*  phase in the peace process and a way to a longer term solution that then we talk about [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1833.1000000000001s)]
*  rehabilitation and reconstruction. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1841.1000000000001s)]
*  Then we also as WHO, not only we're looking at which hospitals and which health facilities, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1845.1000000000001s)]
*  et cetera, there needs to be of course a Palestinian plan that is in the make for that where we [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1851.1000000000001s)]
*  contribute to. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1856.14s)]
*  One topic I can raise already where we have to already raise now, if you look at the medical [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1858.82s)]
*  equipment, for example, medical imaging equipment, x-ray, CTs, MRIs, et cetera. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1863.82s)]
*  Before this crisis, it was very complex to get anything like that into Gaza. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1869.82s)]
*  That needs to change. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1876.82s)]
*  If you really go on a way for rehabilitation and reconstruction, all of that needs to change. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1878.26s)]
*  I don't know how this will be, what the reality will be in the future, but that of course [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1885.02s)]
*  is the plan. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1890.02s)]
*  Over to you. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1891.02s)]
*  Abdulhamid? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1892.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1897.02s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Piper-Kohan. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1898.02s)]
*  One of my questions were asked about the whereabouts of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiyeh, and I didn't hear [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1903.02s)]
*  any concrete answer from you. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1912.98s)]
*  But I was following a report from Al Jazeera, from Gaza, and people were complaining about [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1915.1s)]
*  many things in the field of health. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1924.22s)]
*  First, there is no medical equipment, and there is no emergency kits. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1926.62s)]
*  There is no tents. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1936.7s)]
*  They said only 3% in this cold weather. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1939.42s)]
*  Only 3% of the needed, I think they mentioned 20,000 tents or something more than that. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1943.42s)]
*  The availability of the medicine is not there. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1952.42s)]
*  So, my question, what about the quantity? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1960.42s)]
*  How much you can get into Gaza of the most needed equipment and medicine? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1965.42s)]
*  And the second is related to it. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1972.42s)]
*  What is the situation in Rafah al-Khursi? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1975.42s)]
*  If you want to bring some supplies, who stopped the U.N. trucks and inspect them? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1979.42s)]
*  Are they the Israelis or the Egyptians or the Europeans or a combination of both Europeans [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1988.42s)]
*  and Israelis or Egyptians? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=1999.42s)]
*  What is the situation in Rafah al-Khursi? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2001.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2003.42s)]
*  So, on the Rafah al-Khursi, there's no, by the way, for your information, the Rafah al-Khursi [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2005.42s)]
*  is currently only used for medevac. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2010.42s)]
*  So, it's not used. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2013.42s)]
*  Maybe you have to analyze it better. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2015.42s)]
*  It's not used for any trucks. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2017.42s)]
*  Trucks come in through all kinds of other areas. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2020.42s)]
*  They're through Egypt, through Karam al-Busalam and Karam Shalom, in the north through Eris, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2022.42s)]
*  think to Zikam and other places. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2029.42s)]
*  I think overall, and I'm sure that my colleague I logged in late, but I think overall I've [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2032.42s)]
*  seen the figure that over 10,000 trucks entered. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2039.42s)]
*  And when I look at Gaza, I've been here so often since the crisis. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2042.42s)]
*  And I've seen the, well, especially in the medical field, I would say, yeah, the most [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2047.42s)]
*  horrible scenes I've ever witnessed, even after seven and a half years of Afghanistan [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2056.42s)]
*  and then in almost 20 years of Southern East Africa. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2061.42s)]
*  And I've seen a lot of grim scenes. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2064.42s)]
*  However, if I look at it just as a now not health, the food situation definitely has [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2067.42s)]
*  improved in Gaza, everywhere, everywhere. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2073.42s)]
*  I mean, the food situation has improved. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2078.42s)]
*  Water is still an issue. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2080.42s)]
*  Shelter, you mentioned, et cetera, and the tents, there's a lot of issues around it and [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2082.42s)]
*  should be definitely expanded. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2087.42s)]
*  I'm not the expert on that. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2090.42s)]
*  I'm thinking you have to raise that to maybe the shelter cluster. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2091.42s)]
*  I mean, the issues with that. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2094.42s)]
*  But definitely that needs to be expanded as much as possible. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2096.42s)]
*  On the issues on, you said that medical supplies, essential medicine, of course there are [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2102.42s)]
*  shortages. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2112.42s)]
*  I just want to remind you that also before the crisis, that in Gaza there was a huge [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2113.42s)]
*  shortage on essential medicine and some of the supplies. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2118.42s)]
*  I mean, you talk sometimes about 30 to 40 percent shortages. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2121.42s)]
*  So there was a lot of shortages as well. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2124.42s)]
*  So, yes, there is definitely shortage in a number of areas, in a number of fields. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2127.42s)]
*  And what I said, the non-common diseases, for example, we talk about oncology, dialysis. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2133.42s)]
*  I mean, we try to help the ministry partners trying to expand dialysis, et cetera, being [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2139.42s)]
*  a real issue. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2145.42s)]
*  The hospital I visited in the south, which is non-functional, before the siege on Rafa, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2147.42s)]
*  that has, for example, 600 dialysis patients, et cetera, that was all gone. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2155.42s)]
*  So there's a lot of shortages in the area of non-common diseases. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2160.42s)]
*  Then some of the specialized, the critical specialized medical fields, because of a lack [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2165.42s)]
*  of certain medical specialists and other areas. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2175.42s)]
*  I'm more concerned, though, about the basic health services. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2178.42s)]
*  Primary health care is the basis of everything. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2182.42s)]
*  And that's with all the population movement, for example, from the south to the north, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2186.42s)]
*  I mean, like more than 500 in the south, 560,000. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2191.42s)]
*  And suddenly the north is over a million people, needs to be expanded rapidly. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2196.42s)]
*  There's work. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2200.42s)]
*  Not only there will be so many partners, ministry work on that area, much more is done, needs [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2201.42s)]
*  to be done. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2207.42s)]
*  Basic health service, including what you mentioned, shelter, shelter, shelter, completely agree [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2208.42s)]
*  with that. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2214.42s)]
*  Currently, on the emergency kits and let's say trauma supplies, I think there's a good [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2215.42s)]
*  stock now in Gaza. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2222.42s)]
*  But we need to, of course, expand and stock up as much as possible. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2224.42s)]
*  Fuel was always a problem. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2230.42s)]
*  Fuel to hospitals and health facilities. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2232.42s)]
*  Currently, at least all the partially functional hospitals and facilities, they do have fuel [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2235.42s)]
*  and the ambulance as well. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2241.42s)]
*  So that is approved. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2243.42s)]
*  Is it sufficient? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2245.42s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2247.42s)]
*  Is it good? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2249.42s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2250.42s)]
*  It is. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2251.42s)]
*  I think. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2252.42s)]
*  But I think one thing I think specifically the health workers and WHO and partners should [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2253.42s)]
*  be proud of, I always hear polio and the Polio campaign, no, is that the health system is [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2261.42s)]
*  not completely collapsed, that we still talk about partially functional hospitals and very [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2269.42s)]
*  much a little bit of a basic health care system. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2275.42s)]
*  And now, again, referral pathways. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2277.42s)]
*  Now, we need to expedite that and expand that. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2279.42s)]
*  But there's many other, I would say, larger concern. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2283.42s)]
*  You mentioned one, for example, the shelter. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2287.42s)]
*  Think about the children. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2291.42s)]
*  Think about education. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2293.42s)]
*  And think about private sector. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2295.42s)]
*  But jobs and work, there's so much, there's so many needs. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2297.42s)]
*  I'm going to leave it there. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2301.42s)]
*  Pam? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2303.42s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Piperkorn. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2306.42s)]
*  It's Pamela Fogg from U.S. News and World Report. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2310.42s)]
*  My question is about the, in 2024, the vaccination levels for measles was very high in Gaza. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2314.42s)]
*  Where is it now? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2326.42s)]
*  And is it possible to continue? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2328.42s)]
*  And is measles, I understood that the vaccination effort was falling. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2331.42s)]
*  Needless to say, probably. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2339.42s)]
*  But the second is there was also polio discovered at late 2024 in the wastewater. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2341.42s)]
*  Is there any follow-up on that? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2353.42s)]
*  And are there levels of polio? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2356.42s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2358.42s)]
*  So I think coming back to the measles question. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2364.42s)]
*  So first of all, yeah, Gaza, and also in the West Bank, by the way, vaccine acceptance has historically always been very high. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2373.42s)]
*  So the expanded program immunization was never an issue here. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2382.42s)]
*  You always had coverage rates above 90%. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2388.42s)]
*  Actually much better than many high-income countries. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2391.42s)]
*  And there was never a kind of discussion, of course, with the crisis and the war, et cetera, that initially, the struggles, that initially even collapsed, et cetera. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2396.42s)]
*  But then this was very much seen as part of this, what I said, is minimal health package, like in the medical points, in the UNRWA primary healthcare facilities, in the other primary healthcare facilities, and this medical point. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2410.42s)]
*  This was very much part of the action. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2425.42s)]
*  And we are still analyzing that a lot of data, but I think what we see that actually the EPI coverage, it definitely decreased over the 16 months, but not as bad as we thought. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2429.42s)]
*  I think that the measles were still close to 80 or 85% coverage, which is actually much better. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2444.42s)]
*  Not good enough, by the way, I want to stress that. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2451.42s)]
*  So this is part of the surveillance and the surveillance strengthening, what's going on. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2454.42s)]
*  We're looking at that WHO part, we're looking at that, and also how to improve that. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2460.42s)]
*  Now, if the ceasefire also moves to a peace process, those systems, those are, I would say, the easier systems to get back in place. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2468.42s)]
*  Expanding the cold chain and cold chain activities and everything related to that. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2483.42s)]
*  So critically looking at that, because it's very important that we keep these child vaccinations. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2488.42s)]
*  But despite this devastating crisis and war, better than expected. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2497.42s)]
*  And in polio, yeah, we keep monitoring on polio, you know about the first campaign. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2504.42s)]
*  We keep monitoring the situation. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2510.42s)]
*  Over to you. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2513.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2514.42s)]
*  Last question, Chris. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2515.42s)]
*  Dr. Pieperkorn, thank you so much for your time today. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2517.42s)]
*  Chris Reyes with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2520.42s)]
*  You mentioned the need for a strong World Health Organization, the need to focus on collaboration, not isolation. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2523.42s)]
*  As the U.S. funding is currently being reviewed, as you mentioned and considered, how do you deliver this message to President Trump, who seems intent on questioning the value of the work of your organization and the UN in general? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2531.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think I try to. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2553.42s)]
*  I think I want to go back to the, and you might not like it, but I think that the general reply for we, I think, and I think it has been raised at all levels, because we of course, we regret that announcement and we really hope that this is being reviewed and reconsidered. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2556.42s)]
*  And for me, I mean, like, and I think for all of us, I think global health has become so prominent over the last decades, and not just because of COVID, global health and global health security. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2577.42s)]
*  And we know that the U.S. is not going to be able to do that. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2591.42s)]
*  And many of their institutions are very much in the lead and assisting, etc. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2594.42s)]
*  And as I said personally, I've worked a lot with CDC in many different places on that. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2618.42s)]
*  Now, so it's not just for me, the funding of course is important, but not just the funding, it's also the collaboration and coordination that you help improve health everywhere. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2623.42s)]
*  And that's, if in one area, one country, the results of whatever, a health or a health system or medical treatment or medical treatment protocols are better functioning, you want to share that. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2636.42s)]
*  You want to share that over the world. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2657.42s)]
*  You want to make sure that everyone benefits from that. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2659.42s)]
*  And I think, for example, the tail end, it took a long time with COVID, because I think in the beginning, it was so, there was so much inequity, actually, when it came to that. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2664.42s)]
*  But on the tail end, it also shows what can happen when globally there is collaboration. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2674.42s)]
*  Now, this applies just for epidemics and pandemics. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2681.42s)]
*  It also applies for health emergencies. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2685.42s)]
*  It applies for health systems in general. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2689.42s)]
*  What we can learn from each other, how can we make the world healthier and a safer place? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2692.42s)]
*  And there, again, we all have a role to play. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2700.42s)]
*  And the U.S., I mean, that's also a founding member of WHO, really played a critical role over the years and a critically important role. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2707.42s)]
*  And of course, we want to see this continue and we want to see it continue in collaboration. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2718.42s)]
*  And I want to be sure that I can collaborate also with my U.S. colleagues, how I've done in the past, wherever I worked, and not just from their institutions and public health school, et cetera. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2725.42s)]
*  So that will be my answer. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2739.42s)]
*  And that's where I think we have to really focus on collaboration and not on isolation, specifically when it comes to global health and global health security. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2742.42s)]
*  How do you deliver that directly to the Trump administration, though, who seems to, who holds the power, the executive order power, that would pull this funding? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2755.42s)]
*  Well, I think I'm probably not a person who will deliver that. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2768.42s)]
*  I'm now, I'm not, it's not my role. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2773.42s)]
*  I mean, like that's, and I think there will be, I'm sure there will be many discussions from WHO with the U.S. administration and other countries. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2777.42s)]
*  And for me, my role is now to inform you. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2787.42s)]
*  And I'm sure that you will transform that message in the right way. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2790.42s)]
*  And with that, I'd like to again thank Dr. Piperkorn, the WHO representative in the West Bank in Gaza. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2794.42s)]
*  Thanks very much and have a great, have a great evening. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2801.42s)]
*  Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2805.42s)]
*  Thank you very much. Bye bye. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ypbD2e8ZuA&t=2807.42s)]
