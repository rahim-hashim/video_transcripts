Video Description: The Secretary-General is expected to speak to reporters at the Security Council stakeout on the situation at the Blue Line.

Secretary-General António Guterres voiced his “profound concerns” about escalation between Israel and Hezbollah along the Blue Line, reiterating that “the risk for the conflict in the Middle East to widen is real -- and must be avoided.”

Guterres today (21 Jun) spoke to reporters in New York.

“Let’s be clear: The people of the region and the people of the world cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza,” the UN chief said.

He continued, “On both sides of the Blue Line, many lives have already been lost, tens of thousands of people have been displaced, and homes and livelihoods have been destroyed. Bushfires sparked by explosions are further devastating communities and the environment. Unexploded ordnance and remnants of war litter the landscape.”

Guterres said, “These pose additional threats to people in both Israel and Lebanon and to United Nations and humanitarian personnel.”

The UN chief stressed, “The parties must urgently recommit to the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 and immediately return to a cessation of hostilities.”

“Civilians must be protected. Children, journalists and medical workers should never be targeted. And displaced communities must be able to return to their homes,” he added.

“The world must say loudly and clearly: immediate de-escalation is not only possible – it is essential,” the Secretary-General reiterated.

He continued, “There is no military solution. Further military escalation will only guarantee more suffering, more devastation to communities in Lebanon and Israel, and more potentially catastrophic consequences for the region.”

“It is time for reason and rationality. It is time for practical and pragmatic engagement by the parties to the diplomatic and political avenues available to them,” Guterres stressed.

The UN chief told reporters that the world body is “actively engaging to promote peace, security and stability, in line with Security Council Resolution 1701. UN peacekeepers – UNIFIL - are on the ground working to de-escalate tensions and help prevent miscalculation.”

“The cessation of hostilities and progress toward a permanent ceasefire is the only durable solution,” Guterres stated, adding that the United Nations” fully supports diplomatic efforts to end the violence, restore stability and avoid even greater human suffering in a region that has seen far too much."

The Secretary-General once again pressed for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages and a real pathway to a two-State solution.

Asked about humanitarian aid delivery, Guterres said that inside Gaza, “lawlessness is total.”

He said, “We see extreme difficulty in distributing inside Gaza. So the problem is not only to bring things to Gaza, there must be a mechanism guarantee that there is a minimum of law and order that allows for the distribution to take place. And that's why a ceasefire is so necessary to then properly organize and implement a plan for that purpose.”

Asked about the recent agreement between the the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the Russian Federation, Guterres said, “There are sanctions approved by the Security Council in relation to the DPRK. Any relationship that any country with DPRK including the Russian Federation, must entirely abide by those sanctions.”

*  Thank you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  Time for a couple questions. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=214.98s)]
*  Anade? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=216.5s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=217.7s)]
*  That is the Tim Aljazeera, English. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=218.9s)]
*  Today as you call for de-escalation in the region, Israel has continued strikes in Gaza [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=220.26s)]
*  City in the north, as well as on a displaced community in Nehru Afa. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=224.42s)]
*  What is your reaction? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=228.5s)]
*  Our position has been very clear since a long time ago. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  We need an immediate ceasefire as we need an immediate release of hostages. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=237.02s)]
*  Going on with a military operation that has a dramatic impact on civilians is not solving [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=243.82s)]
*  any problem. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=250.46s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary General. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=251.82s)]
*  First, can you tell us what the United Nations is doing to try and overcome the lawlessness [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  that is preventing aid from actually getting to the people in need in Gaza? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=268.53999999999996s)]
*  Secondly, could we get your reaction to the announcement this week of a mutual assistance [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  pact between North Korea and Russia? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=287.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=290.38s)]
*  Well, there are two different questions. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=291.74s)]
*  First of all, the situation in Gaza became a situation of total lawlessness. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=295.42s)]
*  Most of the trucks with humanitarian aid inside Gaza are now looted because this is a war that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=304.70000000000005s)]
*  is different from any other one. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=313.5s)]
*  Usually in a war, that is, there is one force that attacks. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=315.74s)]
*  They occupy parts of the territory of the other force. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=322.06s)]
*  And then they guarantee security and management of the areas they occupy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  Here we have attacks, we have bombings, and then troops move to other places. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=333.42s)]
*  Hamas returns to the original ones. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=340.94s)]
*  And there is total chaos in Gaza. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=345.5s)]
*  And there is no authority in most of the territory. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=349.98s)]
*  And Israel does not even allow the so-called blue police to escort our convoys because [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=354.86s)]
*  it's a local police linked to the local administration. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=362.62s)]
*  So lawlessness is total. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  We see extreme difficulty in distributing inside Gaza. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=372.22s)]
*  So the problem is not only to bring things to Gaza, there must be a mechanism guaranteeing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=379.26s)]
*  that there is a minimum of law and order that allows for that distribution to take place. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=387.42s)]
*  And that's why a ceasefire is so necessary to then properly organize and implement a plan [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=394.06s)]
*  for that purpose. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=400.46s)]
*  In relation to the second question, there are sanctions approved by the Security Council [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=402.06s)]
*  in relation to the DPRK. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=409.5s)]
*  Any relationship of any country with DPRK, including the Russian Federation, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=414.14s)]
*  must entirely abide by those sanctions. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=421.97999999999996s)]
*  Secretary General, let me get back to the blue line. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=426.85999999999996s)]
*  You just mentioned that it would be devastating if the escalation started. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=429.34s)]
*  That would be devastating for both people in Israel and in Lebanon. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=433.17999999999995s)]
*  How are you going to ensure the security and safety of the peacekeepers in there? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=437.09999999999997s)]
*  And have you ever engaged with Israeli officials? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=442.62s)]
*  Or do you have any plans to engage with Israeli or Lebanese officials on the situation there? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=446.78s)]
*  There are permanent contacts of UNIFIL with both sides in order not only to do its best [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=451.97999999999996s)]
*  for the escalation, but also to guarantee the mission is accomplished and to protect [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=459.5s)]
*  the security not only of people, but also of the peacekeepers themselves. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=470.7s)]
*  And there are very detailed plans for the protection of peacekeepers, including [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=475.97999999999996s)]
*  in the case of a total explosion. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=485.09999999999997s)]
*  For all situations, there are plans that are established. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=491.18s)]
*  There are rules to be followed in order to guarantee the safety of peacekeepers, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=495.65999999999997s)]
*  whatever happens. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=501.97999999999996s)]
*  But now our main concern is to make sure that we do not have a dramatic escalation that [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=503.58s)]
*  would be a disaster for the area and for the world. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VihJHYlU1Fs&t=511.74s)]
