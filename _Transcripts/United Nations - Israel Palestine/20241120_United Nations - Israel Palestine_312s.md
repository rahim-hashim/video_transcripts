# Israel on Middle East and Security Council - Security Council Media Stakeout
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM)
*  Good morning, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=2.24s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Dunon, will deliver a brief statement ahead of this [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=3.64s)]
*  morning's Security Council vote on a resolution for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=8.22s)]
*  He will take your questions afterwards. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  If you do ask a question, please remember to state your name and your news outlet. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=15.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=19.56s)]
*  Good morning, everybody. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=24.3s)]
*  The resolution being considered by the Security Council today is nothing short of a betrayal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=25.78s)]
*  It betrays the 101 innocent hostages still held by Hamas, their grieving families, and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=31.98s)]
*  the very principles the UN claims to defend. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=39.260000000000005s)]
*  If this resolution is adopted today, it will send a message that terrorists can act with [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=43.74s)]
*  impunity. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=48.84s)]
*  It tells Hamas and every other terrorist organization watching that they can murder, rape, and kidnap [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=50.68000000000001s)]
*  innocent people, and the international community will reward them for it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=57.720000000000006s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=63.42s)]
*  This is not a resolution for peace. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=65.56s)]
*  It is a resolution for appeasement. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=67.36s)]
*  It abandons the hostages, rewards Hamas, and emboldens those who believe that violence [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=70.48s)]
*  can achieve their aims. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=76.48s)]
*  To the nations supporting this shameful text, how will you explain to the families of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=78.7s)]
*  101 hostages, some of whom are citizens of Security Council members, that their loved [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=84.4s)]
*  ones are not worth demanding freedom as a condition for a ceasefire? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=91.14s)]
*  It is crucial to have a linkage between a ceasefire and the release of all the hostages. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=96.38s)]
*  This Council has already passed Resolution 2735, yet instead of enforcing it, some on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=103.98s)]
*  the Council are attempting to undermine it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=111.76s)]
*  Instead of pressuring Hamas to end their barbarity, they are trying to give them political cover [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=114.86s)]
*  to prolong their terror. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=120.12s)]
*  Make no mistake, if this resolution passes, Hamas will celebrate today. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=123.28s)]
*  They will thank the nations of this Council for validating their atrocities and legitimizing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=129.86s)]
*  their propaganda. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=136.32000000000002s)]
*  History will remember who stood with the hostages and who abandoned them. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  Israel will never stop fighting for our people, for our hostages, for justice. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=144.22000000000003s)]
*  But I ask this Council today, will you or will you stand with the terrorists? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  Two quick questions. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=159.66s)]
*  Do you expect the U.S. to veto this? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=160.66s)]
*  And number two, do you have a latest on the ceasefire talks in Lebanon? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=162.66s)]
*  So regarding the U.S. position, I absolutely expect the U.S. to veto the resolution. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  When you look at the language of the resolution and the position the U.S. took since October [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=172.06s)]
*  7th, I don't see a way that the U.S. cannot veto such language. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=176.88s)]
*  Regarding Lebanon, we are working hard, we are moving forward, and we want to have an [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=181.7s)]
*  agreement. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=188.36s)]
*  You know, Mr. Oxden is still in the region, he will arrive to Israel, and we will continue [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=189.36s)]
*  the negotiations. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=195.82000000000002s)]
*  Ambassador DeNoon, Dejishu with China Central Television. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=196.82000000000002s)]
*  Let's talk about the looting incidents. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  You said on Monday in the Security Council that those looters, they are Hamas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=202.9s)]
*  Do you have evidence and have you shared information with the U.N. because they said they are the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=206.94000000000003s)]
*  violent gangs? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  And also, if they were Hamas, would that mean that the past 13 months the operation [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=213.1s)]
*  in Gaza by IDF has been failed? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=218.76s)]
*  Because there are still that many Hamas. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=222.06s)]
*  So I agree with you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=224.88s)]
*  You know, the fact that you have chaos and you don't have law and order, and the fact [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=225.88s)]
*  that we coordinated the entrance of 100 trucks through the Kerem Shalom checkpoint and 97 [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=230.32s)]
*  It shows that we still have more work to do in Gaza. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=237.92s)]
*  And yes, we have evidence of the Hamas involvement in the hijacking, and also we know what they [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=243.16s)]
*  are doing with the trucks, where they store them, after they sell it, and they use the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=248.04s)]
*  funds for the terror machine. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  So we are aware of that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=254.72s)]
*  We don't operate in the entire Gaza Strip today. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=256.96s)]
*  We have control over the checkpoints, we have control over other parts, and unfortunately [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=260.96s)]
*  we still see the activities of Hamas when it comes to take advantage of humanitarian [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=266.52s)]
*  aid. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=271.35999999999996s)]
*  But have you shared the information with the U.N. because they don't say that they were [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=272.35999999999996s)]
*  Hamas? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=276.44s)]
*  Well, you know, they always tell us they don't have ways to check who is doing that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=277.44s)]
*  But when you see people with weapons, you can identify them as Hamas, maybe not 100% [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=282.08s)]
*  of them are Hamas, but Hamas is orchestrating that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  Which means you don't really have concrete evidence? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=292.28s)]
*  No, we do. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=294.4s)]
*  We do, and if the U.N. wants to have a dialogue with us, we welcome them to approach me, and [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=295.64s)]
*  we will sit with them and share with them the information we have. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=300.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnBjdxwwqM&t=304.0s)]
