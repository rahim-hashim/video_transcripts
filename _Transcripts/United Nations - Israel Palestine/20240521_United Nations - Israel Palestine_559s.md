Video Description: Briefing by Mr. Tor Wennesland, Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and Personal Representative of the Secretary-General, on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.

The Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, today (20 May) told the Security Council that “regrettably we face yet another precipice of further catastrophe in Gaza amid stalled talks between the parties to secure the release of all hostages held in Gaza and a ceasefire to provide much needed relief to the civilian population.”

Wennesland noted that “just two weeks ago negotiations were ongoing in Cairo with the support of Egypt, Qatar and the United States, however, these talks ended on 9 May without agreement.”

He urged the parties “to redouble all efforts and return to the negotiating table immediately and in good faith.”

The Special Coordinator told the Council that since operations began in early May, “more than 800,000 people have been displaced from Rafah to Mawasi, Khan Younis and Deir al Balah amid daily IDF airstrikes in Rafah, killing dozens of Palestinians.”

Hamas, he said, has also “continued to fire rockets indiscriminately from Gaza towards Israel.”

Noting that “these events have had a significant impact on humanitarian operations and access,” Wennesland said, “the so-called expanded humanitarian area in al-Mawasi lacks adequate shelter, food, water and sewage infrastructure, and crossings for the entry of humanitarian goods have already been directly affected.”

He said he was “deeply concerned that the current trajectory – including the possibility of a larger-scale operation – will further undermine efforts to scale-up the entry of humanitarian goods and their safe distribution to desperate civilians.”

*  Thank you for inviting me to address the Council on Recent Developments in Rafah, where the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=16.82s)]
*  situation is becoming increasingly desperate and dangerous for the already besieged population. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=21.54s)]
*  Regrettably, we face yet another precedent of further catastrophe in Gaza amidst stalled [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=29.5s)]
*  talks between the parties to secure the release of all hostages held in Gaza and a ceasefire [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=36.42s)]
*  to provide much needed relief to the civilian population. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=43.34s)]
*  Just two weeks ago, negotiations were ongoing in Cairo with the support of Egypt, Qatar [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=48.7s)]
*  and the United States. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=54.18s)]
*  However, these talks ended on 9 May without agreement. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=56.5s)]
*  I urge the parties to redouble all efforts and return to the negotiating table immediately [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=62.3s)]
*  and in good faith. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=68.76s)]
*  I reiterate the UN's full support for the tireless efforts by the mediators to achieve [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=70.98s)]
*  this goal, and we stand ready to support implementation of such a deal. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  If talks do not resume, I fear for the worst, for the beleaguered and terrified civilians [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=85.82s)]
*  in Rafah, for the hostages held in unimaginable conditions for more than 225 days, and for [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=92.78s)]
*  an overstretched humanitarian operation that remains on the brink inside the Strip. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=101.58s)]
*  Mr. President, my colleague from Oshawa will brief in greater detail on the di-humanitarian [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=107.94s)]
*  situation in and around Rafah momentarily, but allow me to highlight some critical observations [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=114.3s)]
*  from the ground. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=120.66s)]
*  Since the first week of May, the security situation in Rafah is rapidly worsening as [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=123.66s)]
*  the IDF operations and military maneuvers in and around the city have intensified. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=129.44s)]
*  On May 5, Hamas launched mortars and rockets at IDF soldiers massed on the Israeli side [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=138.62s)]
*  of Karim Abusalam crossing, killing four IDF soldiers and wounding ten. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  IDF tanks, shelling and series of airstrikes in Rafah killed at least 19 Palestinians on [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=154.46s)]
*  the same day, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  The following day, the IDF said that it would prepare to operate with extreme force against [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=166.66s)]
*  Hamas in eastern Rafah and ordered approximately 100,000 Palestinians to immediately evacuate [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=172.62s)]
*  to what is described as an, quote, expanded humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi, unquote. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  Since operations began, more than 800,000 people have been displaced from Rafah to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=188.22s)]
*  Mawasi, Kanyounis and Dier in Bala. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=196.26s)]
*  Amid daily IDF airstrikes in Rafah, killing dozens of Palestinians, Hamas has continued [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=199.66s)]
*  to fire rockets indiscriminately from Gaza towards Israel. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=207.7s)]
*  These events have had a significant impact on humanitarian operations and access. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=214.46s)]
*  The so-called expanded humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi lacks adequate shelter, food, water [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=222.02s)]
*  and sewage infrastructure and crossings for the entry of humanitarian goods have already [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=228.1s)]
*  been directly affected. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=233.82s)]
*  In the wake of the Hamas strike on 6 May, Israeli authorities closed Karim Abusalam [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=237.34s)]
*  crossing for three days. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=244.34s)]
*  The following day, the IDF said it had established an operational control in the Gaza side of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  the Rafah crossing and closed the crossing for the movement of goods and people. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=253.9s)]
*  The Rafah crossing with Egypt remained closed. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=259.86s)]
*  In addition, active hostilities and IDF operations continue to render nowhere safe in Gaza, including [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=263.98s)]
*  for humanitarian workers. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=275.06s)]
*  Just last week, a staff member of the UN Department of Safety and Security from India died and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=278.73999999999995s)]
*  another staff member was seriously injured when the UN vehicle was struck as they travelled [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=284.97999999999996s)]
*  to the European hospital in Rafah, Govnand Raad. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=291.14s)]
*  This brings to a total 193 UN staffers who have been killed in Gaza since the start of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=295.41999999999996s)]
*  the hostilities. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  Humanitarian movements must be made safer. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=305.82s)]
*  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that the current trajectory, including the possibility [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=308.82s)]
*  of a larger scale operations, will further undermine efforts to scale up the entry of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=315.5s)]
*  humanitarian goods and their safe distribution to desperate civilians. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=321.1s)]
*  The opening of the Sikkim or Eris West crossing in Gaza North, including for the entry of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=327.1s)]
*  humanitarian relief items arriving via Astod and from Jordan, is a welcome development, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=334.06s)]
*  as is the entry of the first time of humanitarian supplies through Cyprus via the US-built floating [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=341.02s)]
*  pier on 18 May. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=347.62s)]
*  However, I reiterate that more aid is needed to meet the enormous scale of needs in Gaza [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=350.14s)]
*  and there is no substitute for the full and increased operation of existing land crossings. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=358.34s)]
*  The UN continues to engage with all concerned parties, including the Israeli authorities, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=365.82s)]
*  to address these and other safety concerns, including an improved humanitarian notification [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=370.94s)]
*  system. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=376.53999999999996s)]
*  Mr. President, the Secretary General, alongside numerous international partners and concerned [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=377.53999999999996s)]
*  neighbors, including Egypt, have voiced serious objections to a military operation in the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=385.1s)]
*  city of Rafa amid clear indications of its devastating consequences for the civilian [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=390.14s)]
*  population. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=395.86s)]
*  Saving lives and addressing the critical needs in Rafa and Gaza more broadly must remain [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=397.86s)]
*  our immediate priority and I reiterate the Secretary General's call for a humanitarian [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=404.1s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=410.14s)]
*  At the same time, we must not lose sight of the risk that these immediate threats pose [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=411.65999999999997s)]
*  to the prospects for a resolution of this conflict and for the longer term peace and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=418.65999999999997s)]
*  stability in the region. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=424.06s)]
*  I am very concerned that the failure to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and a large-scale military [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=426.82s)]
*  operation in Rafa exacerbated the risk of escalating regional tensions. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=433.02s)]
*  Since the start of hostilities on 7 October, I have engaged continuously in the region, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=440.26s)]
*  including in Lebanon, to avert a vital spillover and I, in support of the Secretary General, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=445.46s)]
*  will continue these efforts. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=452.86s)]
*  I also reiterate that there can be no long-term solution in Gaza that is not fundamentally [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=455.42s)]
*  political. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=462.41999999999996s)]
*  The new Palestinian government, with eight ministers from Gaza, represent an important [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=464.98s)]
*  opportunity to support tangible steps toward unifying Gaza and the occupied West Bank politically, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=470.5s)]
*  economically and administratively. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=477.02000000000004s)]
*  The international community should provide support to the new government to address its [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  fiscal challenges, strengthen its governance capacity and prepare it to re-assume its responsibility [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=484.5s)]
*  in Gaza and ultimately govern the whole of the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=491.97999999999996s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority must also be an integral part of planning for Gaza's recovery [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=498.97999999999996s)]
*  and construction. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=505.94s)]
*  The devastation and misery of the past seven months have reinforced a simple truth. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=509.78s)]
*  Palestinians and Israelis can no longer wait to establish a viable political horizon to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=517.86s)]
*  end the conflict and establish a two-state solution. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=525.38s)]
*  Day after day, we are witnessing the deadly consequences of inaction. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=529.82s)]
*  Now is the time to lay the foundations for a better future for Palestinians, Israelis [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=537.4200000000001s)]
*  and the broader region. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=544.1800000000001s)]
*  The UN will continue to support all such efforts. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0waDE99Lrc&t=546.22s)]
