# (EN/AR) Palestine on Two-State Solution Conference ( June 17 - 20) – Media Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE)
*  Allow me at the beginning to thank you for responding to our call and consider this press [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=0.0s)]
*  encounter with you as a continuation of the press conference that we had at the end of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=11.16s)]
*  last week as the Arab group in which we explained to you that we have a plan and we are executing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=21.36s)]
*  this plan. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=31.48s)]
*  Let me just review quickly that this plan, it covers the Security Council, the General [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=34.16s)]
*  Assembly, the preparation for the international conference on the two-state solution. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=41.72s)]
*  But all these efforts are for the number one objective of bringing an immediate ceasefire [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=49.04s)]
*  and stopping this war of genocide against our people in the Gaza Strip, to stop it immediately, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=56.76s)]
*  to provide the Palestinian people, especially in the Gaza Strip, with humanitarian assistance [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=64.52s)]
*  to the scale they need and to fight against the crime against humanity of forced transfer [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=71.84s)]
*  and to begin the process of the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip and also to intensify the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=81.84s)]
*  efforts for the international conference on the two-state solution. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=88.36s)]
*  So that is the plan here in New York and of course it is complemented with efforts of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=95.5s)]
*  our colleagues in Geneva, in the Human Rights Council and in the different agencies. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=104.78s)]
*  This is a political offensive. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=112.32s)]
*  You the journalists are a very important dimension of this plan because it is our duty to share [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=115.7s)]
*  with you the details of what we are doing and it is also our duty to respond to your [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=126.04s)]
*  questions so that to have more clarity as to what we are doing in each of these stages [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=134.88s)]
*  so that you can explain it to the millions that you cater to, you write to them in your [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=143.84s)]
*  media or you tell them the stories in the television stations that you have. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=152.32s)]
*  And you have a responsibility to, among other things, to find ways to go to Gaza. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  I invite each and every one of you to go to the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=169.12s)]
*  There is a story to be told about the criminality of what is happening to our people in the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=175.72s)]
*  Gaza Strip. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=182.16s)]
*  You have an obligation, a duty to add your efforts not only to cover the news but to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=183.9s)]
*  be a player, to go in any possible way as independent journalists to go to all corners [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=191.56s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip to tell the story of the crime that is undertaken against the Palestinian [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=201.08s)]
*  people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  And if you do that, and you should do that, you will be contributing to exposing those [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=209.72s)]
*  who are committing these crimes against the Palestinian people and also you will be contributing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=217.64s)]
*  to hold those criminals to account and to advance the cause of justice through accountability. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=225.6s)]
*  So we are all in this thing together. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  Now with regard to the plan, how it is unfolding, we decided in the Arab group through our representative [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=238.44s)]
*  Algeria, of course, with the help of the other representative, Somalia, that we do [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=246.68s)]
*  not accept complacency in the Security Council. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  The Security Council has a responsibility to maintain international peace and security. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=256.08s)]
*  And what is happening in Gaza is a threat against international peace and security. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=263.06s)]
*  So the Security Council has a responsibility to act. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=268.68s)]
*  Therefore, the meetings that we had last week and the week before, the international community, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=275.44s)]
*  the Secretary General, the senior officials of the United Nations, led by Mr. Fletcher [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  and others, and the experts that we brought, especially the doctor from San Francisco who [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=290.28s)]
*  was in Gaza, who shared with the Security Council the details of the crimes in the medical [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=298.72s)]
*  field, were contributions to maximize the pressure in the Security Council to act, not [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=305.12s)]
*  to remain paralyzed. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  So as a result of all these efforts, things started to move in the Security Council, reached [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=315.52s)]
*  the level of a draft resolution adopted and approved by the E-10, the majority, the elected [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=324.16s)]
*  members in the Security Council, and they engaged other members of the Council. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=333.56s)]
*  My understanding that a member of the E-10 took upon itself to engage one country permanently [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=342.36s)]
*  and member, trying to convince them to have a humanitarian resolution to stop the crime, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=354.12s)]
*  to allow for humanitarian assistance. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=363.92s)]
*  In this connection, we support the position of the UN articulated by the SG and Mr. Fletcher [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=367.32s)]
*  that there is no mechanism that can address the needs of the Palestinian people except [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  the UN mechanism, including UNRWA, which has 400 stations in the Gaza Strip to distribute [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=382.2s)]
*  to the people in the Gaza Strip, not the three, four, or five stations that were fictitiously [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  established to provide some assistance. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  And you saw the horrors of when thousands, maybe tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=403.76s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip trying to go to these places, being sniped at, assassinated, terrified, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=411.16s)]
*  about one kilometer away from one of the stations, according to some of your media colleagues [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=423.16s)]
*  who have reported, including a representative of CNN. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=429.48s)]
*  I was listening to him yesterday reporting from Tel Aviv. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=434.32s)]
*  He said that there were confirmed reports from humanitarians and others that a kilometer [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=438.28s)]
*  away from the place of reaching the humanitarian distribution center, according to the mechanism [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=444.64s)]
*  put in place, not the UN mechanism, and then there were gunned down some Palestinians through [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=452.64s)]
*  snipers and other methods of killing them to horrify them so that they do not even reach [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=461.76s)]
*  this mechanism that they put in place for humanitarian assistance. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=469.44s)]
*  So the mechanism of the UN is the solid one, is the one that is supported almost by everyone, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=474.72s)]
*  the Arabs, the Muslims, the Europeans, everyone, because why do you try to find a mechanism [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=483.56s)]
*  when the existing mechanism is a solid one, tested one, approved itself, they have the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=491.08s)]
*  experience, they have the personnel, they know how to reach the people in all corners [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=498.08s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip and provide humanitarian assistance to them. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=504.28s)]
*  So we will know in the Security Council at 12 o'clock exactly what the E-10 will proceed [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=509.76s)]
*  to do with the humanitarian draft resolution. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=518.0799999999999s)]
*  Now the Security Council has to act, and the threat or the fear of not succeeding should [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=524.4799999999999s)]
*  not deter the Security Council from carrying its responsibility. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=536.4799999999999s)]
*  But of course, the Security Council speaks for itself. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=542.48s)]
*  We are in contact with all those who are genuinely concerned and outraged. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=546.48s)]
*  It was not only the Palestinian people who are outraged, as I expressed in my last statement [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=553.48s)]
*  in the Security Council, but I can objectively say the great majority of humanity and nation [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=560.48s)]
*  states are outraged of what is really going on in Gaza and they want to do something. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=567.98s)]
*  So that's why we see some elevation and changes of positions from big important countries [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=576.32s)]
*  in Europe and beyond, such as France, UK and Canada. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=584.24s)]
*  Their statement 10 days ago was very clear, very powerful, and very different than previous [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=590.76s)]
*  positions that they have articulated on this issue. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=599.48s)]
*  That is significant. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=603.4s)]
*  That is a beginning of turning the corner, and we hope to see more of that. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=605.14s)]
*  And it is not Israel that will decide the future of the people in the Middle East, especially [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=612.36s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=618.4s)]
*  It is us, we, the people, will determine our own future with the support and the help of [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=619.98s)]
*  the great majority of nations. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=627.78s)]
*  So we will see what happens in the Security Council. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=630.26s)]
*  In the General Assembly, we are grateful for Spain's initiative to go to the General Assembly [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=633.46s)]
*  with a humanitarian resolution. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=639.7s)]
*  That position was adopted at the highest level in Spain, led by the Prime Minister. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=642.96s)]
*  We appreciate that, and we are grateful for the effort of Spain, which last year took [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=649.5s)]
*  the lead among European countries to recognize the state of Palestine. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=655.06s)]
*  We've been working with them. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=660.14s)]
*  The draft resolution is almost ready, humanitarian one. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=662.3s)]
*  They might make the decision to circulate it for reaction of countries today or very [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=668.56s)]
*  soon, and to finish the consultation and try to table it before the end of this week in [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=675.7199999999999s)]
*  order to be able to give to the Secretariat of the General Assembly the four working [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=683.68s)]
*  days before acting on the resolution, which means the plan is to try to act on it by the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=690.8s)]
*  end of next week. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=698.28s)]
*  So the Security Council is acting. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=701.1199999999999s)]
*  The General Assembly is acting. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=705.04s)]
*  Geneva is acting. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=707.8399999999999s)]
*  Now the International Conference. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=710.56s)]
*  Of course, there are several meetings took place. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=714.68s)]
*  I am sure that you covered a number of them in preparation for this conference. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=718.64s)]
*  What has been accomplished so far is a concept note. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=724.8399999999999s)]
*  It's a very clear, strong, effective concept note of what this conference wants to accomplish. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=729.84s)]
*  And also the eight roundtable were also established. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=739.64s)]
*  The definition of the role of each of these roundtables has been articulated as well. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=745.52s)]
*  The leadership, the co-chairs of these roundtables also has been decided. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=752.2s)]
*  The majority of them are from European countries for obvious reasons and Arab countries for [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=759.2s)]
*  obvious reasons without excluding regions. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=765.6s)]
*  For example, in North and South America, Canada is in the leadership loop. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=770.6400000000001s)]
*  Mexico is in the leadership loop. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=778.0s)]
*  Brazil is. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=782.0400000000001s)]
*  In Africa, Senegal is in addition, of course, to Egypt. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=783.84s)]
*  In Asia, we have Japan in the leadership role and we have Indonesia in addition to the Europeans [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=790.36s)]
*  and the Arabs. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=799.88s)]
*  So all corners of the globe are there. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  These are powerful countries. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=803.88s)]
*  If the 19 leaders, the two co-chairs and the co-chairs of the eight roundtable, they are [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=806.48s)]
*  to commit to implement what they called for in the concept paper, we expect from them [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=814.72s)]
*  to commit and to declare before the conference and during the conference to a number of practical [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=823.72s)]
*  steps such as for those who have not recognized the state of Palestine to do so or those countries [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=831.72s)]

*  institutions of the state of Palestine in the years to come in a concrete way, in a [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=848.28s)]
*  financial way, supporting programs so that this state of Palestine to become stronger [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=855.64s)]
*  and stronger in the face of this ruthless occupation. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=862.64s)]
*  And if they also take steps as was adopted in the Madrid conference on the 25th to stop [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=868.36s)]
*  sending weapons to Israel to kill Palestinian children. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=875.88s)]
*  And as Chile did just the other day to sever any relationship with the settlements and [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=880.4s)]
*  the settlers and also to take measures in order to shorten the life of this illegal [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=888.84s)]

*  So all these things are unfolding, more preparation is taking place, we expect large number of [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=902.9200000000001s)]

*  other conference. It is going to be a turning point in the process of ending this illegal [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=926.56s)]
*  occupation as articulated in the historic advisory opinion of the ICJ which said because [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=932.56s)]
*  this occupation is denying the Palestinian people the right to self-determination, putting [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=939.56s)]
*  in place a system of discrimination, apartheid, illegally stealing our land and building illegal [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=946.56s)]
*  settlements and settlers which need to be broken and eliminated according to the ruling [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=954.56s)]
*  of the ICJ and also that is illegally annexing land of the Palestinian people. Because of [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=961.56s)]
*  all these things the ICJ said that this occupation is illegal and it has to be terminated as [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=968.56s)]
*  quickly as possible and asked the General Assembly to adopt modalities to do so. The [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=976.04s)]

*  to be done in your capacity as a third party, as a state, what are you going to do to end [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1026.52s)]
*  this illegal occupation? So we will continue working with all of them. We will continue [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1034.6s)]
*  informing you and we expect you to inform your audience and your followers and to educate [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1040.76s)]

*  structures to continue the process until we accomplish this global consensus of ending [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1083.7199999999998s)]
*  this illegal occupation and having the freedom and independence of the state of Palestine [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1091.72s)]
*  with East Jerusalem as its capital so that we can say the two-state solution would become [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1098.72s)]
*  a reality. This is the background, okay? If you have questions, by all means. Yes, ma'am. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1105.72s)]
*  I'm going to turn the mic. So according to sources, the country that you mentioned, the [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1120.72s)]
*  permanent council member, which is the U.S., is not engaging on the draft resolution as [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1127.92s)]
*  far as what we know. So you're saying at 12 we'll know if the council is going to go ahead [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1135.04s)]
*  and vote on it even if the U.S. is not engaging on that draft resolution? I said that there [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1140.04s)]
*  was a country from among the E-10 took upon itself to engage the country that you referred [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1145.68s)]
*  to, the permanent member. And we will find out what the report from that member of the [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1154.16s)]
*  E-10, which took upon itself to engage, not on behalf of the 10 but in its own national [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1164.24s)]
*  capacity, which we appreciate their efforts. We need to find a way for the Security Council [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1172.0s)]
*  to adopt a position regarding humanitarian help to our people in the Gaza Strip through [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1179.8s)]
*  the mechanisms of the United Nations and the international humanitarians who are present [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1189.64s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. So we will see what the report will be and we will see what the E-10 [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1195.72s)]
*  will decide to do. I am sure that the E-10 will share with you what their plans are. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1202.72s)]
*  But I should not jump the gun and speak on their behalf because I don't. But I'm sharing [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1211.44s)]
*  with you the development as they are unfolding. Still, you know, we will not leave a stone [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1219.44s)]
*  unturned in order to bring an end to this vicious attack against our people in the Gaza [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1227.88s)]
*  Strip. We need immediate and sustainable ceasefire and we need humanitarian assistance to scale [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1236.2s)]
*  to reach all Palestinian people in all corners of the Gaza Strip through existing mechanisms. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1243.2s)]
*  Ambassador Farnoush Amiri with AP, can you tell us if any of those 40 countries, 40 or [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1250.2s)]
*  so countries that have yet to recognize the state of Palestine have done so ahead of the [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1257.24s)]
*  conference? Have you gotten any assurances from them that they plan to make announcements? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1262.24s)]
*  Ambassador Farnoush Amiri We will find out soon. But let me just tell [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1270.24s)]
*  you, if you are a leader in the preparation of this conference and if you are advocating [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1274.8s)]
*  in the concept paper for countries to take practical steps to be action-oriented conference [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1283.36s)]
*  and you have not recognized the state of Palestine, wouldn't it make sense that you would lead [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1291.36s)]
*  by example by taking a step in that direction? And if you are also a leader among the 19 [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1300.9199999999998s)]
*  leaders, whether co-chairing the roundtables or the two co-chairs of the conference, you [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1309.0s)]
*  are asking the international community and nations to take practical steps to strengthen [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1316.84s)]
*  the institutions of the state of Palestine, to stop the war in Gaza, to reconstruct Gaza, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1325.28s)]
*  which requires commitment to substantial amount of monies. Shouldn't the leaders to lead by [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1332.76s)]
*  example by themselves committing to substantial amount of commitment in that direction? We [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1339.76s)]
*  trust that those leaders who are in a position of leadership and adopting and approving the [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1346.76s)]
*  concept paper will declare important steps in that direction. It's only a short period [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1355.76s)]
*  of time from now before the conference to be convened and we are cautiously optimistic, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1363.04s)]
*  but we trust that those leaders have the capability to do the right thing and we trust they will [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1374.36s)]
*  do the right thing. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1385.4s)]
*  My understanding in all of the meetings that took place here in New York, the three big [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1386.4s)]
*  ones, the United States was present, but at a lower level. They did not speak. My understanding [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1396.5600000000002s)]
*  also in some of the meetings, Israel parties was present, but my understanding also is [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1409.0800000000002s)]
*  that they did not speak. This is general assembly formula. Every member of the general [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1416.4s)]
*  assembly is allowed and invited to participate in this conference. Those who select not to [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1422.2800000000002s)]
*  participate, that is their choice, but there is no one being deprived from participating [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1429.76s)]
*  in this meeting. Yes, ma'am. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1437.68s)]
*  He did not officially declare. I am hopeful that by the time the conference is with us [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1442.68s)]
*  around getting closer and many leaders announce their participation, I am hopeful that President [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1456.92s)]
*  Abbas will participate, but the decision is up to him and up to the advisors around [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1463.92s)]
*  him. I am sure they are debating and discussing this issue. I impressed on him when I met [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1471.68s)]
*  with him in Amman recently that it is important for him to be in this conference, but I trust [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1478.72s)]
*  his decision. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1486.92s)]
*  There is an Arabic proverb that says that if you try to experience a cane and a cane, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1487.92s)]
*  it will not produce the same results. How many times have you tried to make a decision [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1501.44s)]
*  that is not the same as the one you have? I have not tried to make a decision that is [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1517.92s)]
*  not the same as the one you have. I have not tried to make a decision that is not the same [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1538.92s)]
*  as the one you have. What could be done to deter the U.S. from continuing its endless [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1548.92s)]
*  enormous support of Israel? My answer to this question, which reflects [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1557.92s)]
*  a mood of a large number of people who are frustrated with the fact that the international [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1569.48s)]
*  community, including the Security Council, is dragging its feet and not stopping this [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1577.48s)]
*  crime against our people. I understand that feeling. I get it, but yet also in the same [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1584.96s)]
*  time I believe in two things. One, there is a law in physics that we learned in physics [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1592.88s)]
*  that it says if you keep accumulating things, the accumulation of quantities at one point [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1600.2800000000002s)]
*  will lead to a transformation into changes of quality. This is a law in physics. So that's [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1610.64s)]
*  number one. And I am a science student, although I am also a political scientist, and a law [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1617.64s)]
*  by practice through this U.N. which requires creative thinking to keep accumulating. I [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1626.0400000000002s)]
*  am not a magician or I am not a scientist. I am a scientist. I am a scientist. I am a [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1635.1200000000001s)]
*  scientist. I am a scientist. I can do things that require me to keep accumulating. I am [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1642.12s)]
*  not a magician or I, there is a silver bullet. If any one of you has a silver bullet to resolve [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1650.0s)]
*  this issue in a few seconds, please show me. The second thing that I rely on, we are not [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1657.08s)]
*  exception to the rule. Let's take the super noble leader among all of us, Nelson Mandela. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1665.1s)]
*  forever, including 27 years in Robben Island as a prisoner. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1672.12s)]
*  But he kept accumulating. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1677.86s)]
*  He kept accumulating. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1679.86s)]
*  And he won the support not only of his people, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1682.02s)]
*  but the support of the majority of nations, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1686.4599999999998s)]
*  starting from Europe, after Africa, and other countries. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1689.76s)]
*  And there was one last country that even after he was released [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1694.9599999999998s)]
*  from Robben Island and came to the United States as a [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1700.66s)]
*  superhero of humanity, he was still received a visa with an [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1703.8000000000002s)]
*  exception because he was a terrorist. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1710.16s)]
*  He was removed from the terrorist list in that country [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1713.1200000000001s)]
*  four years after his freedom from Robben Island. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1718.22s)]
*  Now, people do not like to remember these details. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1723.2s)]
*  They like to remember that he was free. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1727.22s)]
*  We are like him. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1730.24s)]
*  We are still marching the march of accumulating this tremendous [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1732.0s)]
*  support that we are receiving from everyone, from millions, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1737.5800000000002s)]
*  hundreds of millions of people in the streets of everywhere. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1741.8400000000001s)]
*  This is a qualitative shift even in the United States of America. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1745.94s)]
*  And you lived most of your life in the United States. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1751.7s)]
*  I did like you. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1755.9s)]
*  We tried so many times in the past to include justice for the [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1757.84s)]
*  Palestinians as part of the national discourse among the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=1762.0s)]

*  This is a moment of truth and no one has an excuse. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2413.12s)]
*  Don't blame others. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2418.12s)]
*  You can act in your national capacity. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2419.2s)]
*  In my meeting yesterday to the OIC group, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2422.2s)]
*  I told them even those of you who have not, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2426.2s)]
*  have no relationship whatsoever with Israel, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2430.2s)]
*  there is nothing that can deprive your parliaments, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2434.2s)]
*  your governments of making declaration of such that we will [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2438.2s)]
*  never allow settlers to take a visa to our country. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2443.2s)]
*  And we will never have relationship with settlements. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2448.2799999999997s)]
*  We will boycott products from settlements, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2453.2799999999997s)]
*  although you might not import a single orange from any of these [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2455.2799999999997s)]
*  settlements. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2462.2799999999997s)]
*  But making such declaration is showing that you are ready for [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2463.2799999999997s)]
*  practical steps and maybe an investment in encouraging those [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2468.2799999999997s)]
*  who have such relationship to follow your steps. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2473.2799999999997s)]
*  So no excuse for anyone. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2477.36s)]
*  Everyone is able to take practical steps. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2480.36s)]
*  This is the time to take these practical steps to stop this [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2484.36s)]
*  genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2488.36s)]
*  to stop the aggression against the Palestinian people in the [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2492.36s)]
*  occupied territory, and to save the Palestinian people from the [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2496.36s)]
*  crimes that are committed against them, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2502.36s)]
*  starvation, lack of medicine, children are dying from hunger, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2505.44s)]
*  and all the detailed crimes committed against us by the [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2511.44s)]
*  Israeli occupying authorities. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2516.44s)]
*  Each and everyone has a moral responsibility to act, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2519.44s)]
*  including you as journalists. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2523.44s)]
*  Tell the truth. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2526.44s)]
*  Go and see reality. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2527.44s)]
*  Tell the story of the Palestinian people. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2529.44s)]
*  Let your audiences learn of what is really happening so that they [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2532.52s)]
*  can act with their governments, with their parliaments, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2537.52s)]
*  with their leaders. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2541.52s)]
*  We, all of us, have to act. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2542.52s)]
*  And I think Mr. Tom Fletcher summed it correctly. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2547.52s)]
*  He said, our children and grandchildren will ask us in the [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2551.52s)]
*  future, what have you done when the genocide took place against [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2556.52s)]
*  the Palestinian people? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2561.6s)]
*  So all of us will be judged by history as to how much have we [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2562.6s)]
*  done in order to stop this crime against the Palestinian people. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2568.6s)]
*  Did you contribute in a practical way to stop it, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2572.6s)]
*  or did you just watch and did nothing? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2577.6s)]
*  On that note, and I want to thank you very much, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2580.6s)]
*  we will talk more often. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2583.6s)]
*  If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask us. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2585.6s)]
*  My duty and the duty of my team and my colleagues, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2588.68s)]
*  the Arab Ambassador, is to explain to you the details of [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2593.68s)]
*  what is unfolding and the rest is in your hands. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2597.68s)]
*  And we trust you will convey it to your audience in the best [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2601.68s)]
*  objective and effective way. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2606.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19_zasy4JE&t=2609.68s)]
