Video Description: Informal comments to the media by Sigrid Kaag, Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for Gaza, on the situation in the region.

--------
Outside the Council, Kaag told reporters that “forced displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza is both not acceptable. It's a violation of international law and Palestinians themselves don't want it, and countries of the region don't want it.”

She said, “Gaza can be recovered and reconstructed. It is complicated, complex, but with political will and the right agreements, it can be done.”

# Gaza situation Senior Humanitarian Coordinator's Media Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM)
*  Yeah, sorry. Good afternoon. We're delighted to be joined by secret car or special coordinator for the Middle East [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=0.0s)]
*  These processes just brief the council. I think secret you want to go straight to questions exactly. Yeah, okay, great [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=5.88s)]
*  Maggie, please [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Thank you [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=15.88s)]
*  At the top of your remarks you said that this may be our last chance to achieve a two-state solution [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=17.56s)]
*  Could you just expand on that a bit? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=24.88s)]
*  Yes, well, I think the reality is staring us in the face and has been for quite some time if you look at [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=26.8s)]
*  the impact of a conflict if you look at the Gaza Strip if you look at the expansion of settlements if you look at [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=32.72s)]
*  Repeated calls with a threat of annexation. I think we could not be further away from the lofty ideals [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=38.92s)]
*  So it's also my intent to remind the council that statements are one thing but we need action [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=45.2s)]
*  And it's the two-state solution as a viable solution geographically [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=51.72s)]
*  is withering away before our very eyes and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  Words themselves won't solve it. It needs active political engagement and diplomacy [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=60.4s)]
*  Thank you, madam Cognac always nice to see you. Thank you Edie. Thank you [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=71.12s)]
*  What are your [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=78.24s)]
*  expectations about [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=80.24s)]
*  Financing for [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=83.32s)]
*  Construction given [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=85.28s)]
*  what's going on elsewhere in the world and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=87.55999999999999s)]
*  the diminishing amount of money going to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=92.28s)]
*  Humanitarian projects. Yeah. Well, I think there are two questions, but they're not necessarily related. The first one is [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  Official development assistance including humanitarian assistance has always been precious [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=105.36s)]
*  We've always had to leverage other sources of income that's as long as sort of I've been working for the UN [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=110.04s)]
*  However, the reconstruction of Gaza is a very tall order. The amounts are significant given the state of destruction [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=116.44s)]
*  What we need is clarity on the politics the governance arrangements as well as security [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=123.16s)]
*  And then there'll be a mix of public and private financing [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=128.32s)]
*  I'm not counting on official official development assistance alone. Then of course, we will look towards the European Union [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=132.2s)]
*  We will look towards the countries of the Gulf States. There's also a big factor here, which is private sector [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=138.24s)]
*  Investment financing and risk financing all that can be constructed [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=144.56s)]
*  My team under 2720 has done a number of studies and I know the World Bank has done as well [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=148.4s)]
*  At the moment in a strange way that is the least of my worries [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=154.0s)]
*  It's the politics and governance to get to do the job to recover and reconstruct Gaza. Thank you [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=157.88s)]
*  Ask a follow-up question [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=164.74s)]
*  Are you going to Washington and do you plan to meet any officials from the Trump? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=166.06s)]
*  Administration and if so, I see in your remarks that you have [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=174.3s)]
*  Totally rejected [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=181.10000000000002s)]
*  the president's idea of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=183.74s)]
*  Of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=187.22s)]
*  Pulling all Palestinians out of Gaza and making it into the Mideast Riviera [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=189.3s)]
*  Well, I think the paraphrasing is yours Edie if I may I'm not going to Washington this time [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=196.7s)]
*  But I'll be back in a few weeks and I hope to meet with a number of American officials in the region in this case [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=201.74s)]
*  They travel so much. You don't have to go to Washington [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  You might actually catch them closer to home so to speak and of course we will be in contact with [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=209.7s)]
*  All officials because the UN as I stated very clearly wants to be supportive to all efforts [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=214.74s)]
*  We're not at the negotiations table. Now, I think the Secretary General [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=220.34s)]
*  Palestinians themselves [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=225.02s)]
*  Countries of the region have been very clear from the first second that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=226.7s)]
*  forced displacement of the Palestinians from Gaza is both not acceptable. It's a violation of international law and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=230.86s)]
*  Palestinians themselves don't want it and countries of the region don't want it Gaza can be recovered and reconstructed it is complicated [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=238.5s)]
*  Complex, but with political will and the right agreements it can be done and I'd like to remind everybody [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  Palestinians are phenomenal builders [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=253.57999999999998s)]
*  They've even built illegal settlements [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=255.94s)]
*  According to some assessments it would take 15 years or more to reconstruct Gaza. What's your ballpark? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=258.18s)]
*  Honestly, I don't know and I'm not going to compete with the real estate experts here. There's a technical study our [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=272.14s)]
*  Rapid updated disaster needs assessment has a ballpark which is faced between three first three years for rubble removal [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=279.3s)]
*  Temporary housing and then it goes on [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=287.02000000000004s)]
*  Obviously if you only have to visit Gaza to see that it will take time and a lot of work needs to be done [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  But I'm not going to speculate if it's going to be one year more or less [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=296.18s)]
*  It will always take more time in our experience [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=298.74s)]
*  But that's not the point once you start you create prospects you create hope you get people employed [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  You create the alternatives on the ground with and by the Palestinians you have change. Thank you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=307.06s)]
*  You [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmsKewH3CM&t=316.42s)]
