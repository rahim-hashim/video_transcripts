Video Description: Secretary-General António Guterres today (26 Sep) said people in Gaza are “existing, not living,” and if “there is any outpost of hope in this hellscape,” it is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).

Addressing a Ministerial level meeting to discuss the situation of the agency, Guterres said, “attempts to evict UNRWA from its headquarters in East Jerusalem continue,” while on the political level, there are “systematic disinformation campaigns to discredit the agency's life-long work.”

He noted that “draft legislation in the Israeli parliament seeks to label the agency a terrorist organisation and to make any activity by UNRWA on Israel territory Illegal.”

UNRWA’s Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini told the meeting that “Palestinians are no stranger to loss, but to be dispossessed from education, which has always been a source of tremendous pride, is new.”

He said, “we cannot afford to lose an entire generation and sow the seeds for future hatred and extremism.”

Disturbingly, Lazzarini continued, “senior Israeli officials have described destroying UNRWA as a war goal.”

He described efforts to evict the agency from East Jerusalem, and to revoke its privileges and immunities, and designate it as a terrorist organisation, which he said is “an unconscionable action by a member state against a UN entity mandated by the General Assembly.”

Jordan’s Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Aṣ-ṣafadī, Co-Chair of today’s meeting, said, “the indispensability of UNRWA cannot be questioned, nor can the fact that UNRWA cannot be replaced, for doing that is questioning the right of Palestinian children to food, to shelter, to education and to hope.”

Aṣ-ṣafadī said, “UNRWA schools, most of them were decimated. Those that still stand are sheltering Palestinians, children, women who are killed by Israeli bombs and starved by Israeli siege, denying them water, food, medicine.”

He said, “we need UNRWA because nobody can help the Palestinians in Gaza more than UNRWA now.”

The other Co-Chair, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden Maria Malmer Stenergard, said, “the underfunding of UNRWA remains deeply concerning” and while she welcomed “generous contributions” from new and recurring donors “more steps must be taken towards a sufficient, predictable and sustainable funding for the agency, including by broadening the donor base.”

Today’s meeting emphasized UNRWA’s indispensable and irreplaceable role in the lives of Palestinian refugees, particularly in Gaza, and seeked to explore ways to bolster political and financial support for the agency.

# Gaza Crisis: Calls for Increased Support to UNRWA - UN Chief | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk)
*  Excellencies, distinguished guests, I thank the Ashamite Kingdom of Jordan and Sweden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=0.0s)]
*  for co-chairing their gathering and for their continued leadership in the support to UNRWA. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=12.38s)]
*  And I also thank all of you here today for your solidarity with Palestine refugees. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=22.12s)]
*  When we met one year ago, I spoke about putting ourselves in the shoes of Palestinians in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=30.72s)]
*  Gaza, of imagining what life must be like. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=37.52s)]
*  And I ended my remarks one year ago by saying this is the most dramatic humanitarian problem [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=44.96s)]
*  associated with the riskiest explosive potential. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=54.96s)]
*  This was just days before the horrors of October 7. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=60.84s)]
*  Now almost one year since that day, the situation for Palestinians in Gaza is beyond imagination. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=66.64s)]
*  It has been said that the United Nations was not created to bring us to heaven, but to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=74.88s)]
*  save us from hell. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=83.6s)]
*  Unfortunately, neither the United Nations nor anyone else that might have the power [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  to do it was able to save the people of Gaza from hell. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=95.3s)]
*  We have failed the people of Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=104.12s)]
*  They are in a living hell that somehow gets even worse by the day. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=107.68s)]
*  Over 41,000 people have been reportedly killed and more than 90,000 wounded, many with life-changing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=114.72s)]
*  and lifelong injuries. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  The majority are women and children. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Two million Palestinians are now crammed into a space the size of Shanghai International [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=132.4s)]
*  Airport, existing, not living, but existing, among lakes of sewage, piles of rubbish and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  mountains of rubble. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  The only certainty they have is that tomorrow will be worse. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  Yet if there is any outpost of hope in this hellscape, it is UNRWA. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=162.0s)]
*  Even though UNRWA, as we all know, has not been spared. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=169.16s)]
*  On the human level, 222 UNRWA colleagues have been killed, many together with entire families, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=175.52s)]
*  several in the line of duty. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=187.64s)]
*  This is the highest death toll in UN history. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=191.84s)]
*  I ask all of you to think for a moment in the different entities that you preside or [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=196.68s)]
*  to which you belong. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=209.68s)]
*  What would be the impact if 222 members would have been killed and even after that having [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=213.32s)]
*  to go on with their duties to save the people of Palestine? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=224.0s)]
*  UNRWA personnel have been attacked repeatedly while going about their work. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=231.76s)]
*  Men and men are displaced, shot at and subject to violent protests, detained by Israeli security [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=239.72s)]
*  forces reporting mistreatment and torture. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=246.6s)]
*  UNRWA has not been spared on the operational level. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=251.44s)]
*  The humanitarian response in Gaza is being strangled. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=256.2s)]
*  Protection and deconfliction mechanisms for humanitarian aid deliveries have failed. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=261.84s)]
*  The attempts to evict UNRWA from its headquarters in East Jerusalem continue. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=268.08s)]
*  And UNRWA has not been spared on the political level. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=273.84s)]
*  These include systematic disinformation campaigns to discredit the agency's lifelong work. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, draft legislation in the Israeli parliament seeks to label the agency a terrorist [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=286.0s)]
*  organization and to make any activity by UNRWA on Israel or Israel territory illegal. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=293.8s)]
*  In the face of the catastrophic conditions, UNRWA perseveres. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=305.24s)]
*  And this is a tribute to the resilience of the women and men of UNRWA and a tribute to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  your support. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=317.76s)]
*  Excellencies, I have full confidence in UNRWA's continued commitment to upholding the humanitarian [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  principles of neutrality, impartiality and humanity, and to implement the recommendations [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=329.0s)]
*  of the independent review by Catherine Colonna. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=335.4s)]
*  And member states are showing that same confidence. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=340.68s)]
*  Virtually all donors have reversed their funding suspensions. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=345.84s)]
*  123 countries have signed up to the Declaration on Shared Commitments to UNRWA. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  And this underscores the consensus that UNRWA's role across the occupied West Bank and the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  region is vital. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  Friends, there is no alternative to UNRWA. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=366.55999999999995s)]
*  Now is the time to work on all fronts to intensify support for the agency's vital mission. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=371.56s)]
*  Support with funding that is sufficient, predictable and flexible. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  Of course, we all know that UNRWA is not a sustainable long-term solution to the plight [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=385.44s)]
*  of Palestine refugees. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=390.2s)]
*  It was never meant to be. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=392.56s)]
*  That is why we keep pressing for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the immediate release [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=395.44s)]
*  of all hostages and a long-term political solution, ending the occupation and leading [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=400.6s)]
*  to two states living side by side in peace and security with Jerusalem as the capital. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=407.0s)]
*  But until that moment, UNRWA remains indispensable. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=415.0s)]
*  I urge your full support. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=419.76000000000005s)]
*  I call on us to save UNRWA as it works to save and serve Palestine refugees. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=423.56s)]
*  And I thank you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=431.56s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary General. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=433.56s)]
*  Thank you not just for attending our meeting, but thank you for your leadership. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=437.08s)]
*  Thank you for your principled stand on the side of international law, international [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=441.28s)]
*  humanitarian law against very, very difficult odds. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=445.72s)]
*  Your words have been an inspiration. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=449.92s)]
*  Your positions have been a reminder that leaders have to lead. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=452.12s)]
*  Sir, you have been leading very effectively and with dignity. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=456.8s)]
*  We thank you for that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d6hwXw-0Wk&t=461.52000000000004s)]
