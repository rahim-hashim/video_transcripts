Video Description: Vital medical supplies are fast running out in Gaza’s remaining hospitals, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned today (29 May) amid reports of continuing Israeli bombing and hostilities in the enclave.

“We have distributed an enormous amount of essential medical supplies, but it's not enough. I mean, this is such an overwhelming disaster, it’s not enough,” said Dr Rik Peeperkorn, WHO Representative in Palestine.

Speaking in Geneva on the sidelines of the World Health Assembly, the senior WHO official echoed widespread international condemnation of the Israeli airstrike at a camp for displaced people at Tal as-Sultan northwest of Rafah, that left scores dead on Sunday (26 May).

Some 75 patients received treatment at the IMC field hospital.

Out of those 75, 25 were very critical, the IMC official added, fuelling deep concerns that the specialist burns and trauma care and medicines they need are out of reach in Gaza, since the Israeli military seized the main aid crossing point at Rafah earlier this month.

“You can only do so much in Gaza. And when it comes to really extensive burns, et cetera, there's no place currently in Gaza where that can be treated.” Dr Peeperkorn said.

“Since the closing of the Rafah crossing, we only have had three trucks into Rafah. They came through Kerem Shalom and that's the only supply. We fortunately still have some supplies, but they are quickly running out.”

The perilous lack of lifesaving aid supplies could be reversed if lorries carrying humanitarian aid are allowed back into the enclave in significant numbers, the WHO official insisted.

“There are 60 WHO trucks standing in Al Arish ready to get into Gaza. So again, this plea: the Rafah crossing needs to be opened not just for medical supplies, but for all other humanitarian supplies.”

“We have distributed an enormous amount of essential emergency medical supplies, but it's not enough. I mean, like, this is such an overwhelming disaster, it's not enough. Now, when there would be a sustained ceasefire and there would be entry routes into Gaza which are properly managed, when there is a deconfliction mechanism which actually facilitates and supports, much more is possible.”

The UN health agency has previously warned that more Gazans will die unless desperately needed medical evacuations for seriously sick or injured Gazans are allowed outside the enclave.

Some “10,000-plus” people are believed to require urgent transport outside Gaza for treatment but since the Rafah closure on 6 May, “there's no medical evacuation outside Gaza - and it was already a huge problem before”, Dr Peeperkorn said.

According to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) and OCHA, the intensification of hostilities and issuance of evacuation orders have displaced more than 940,000 people from Rafah in the past three weeks, alongside 100,000 who have been displaced in northern Gaza.

Attacks on Rafah have continued unabated, and civilians displaced by hostilities lack shelter, food, water and other supplies and services essential to their survival, OCHA said in an update on Tuesday (28 May).

The same update reported that Gazan health facilities continue to face dire shortages of fuel and medical supplies while having to cope with a rising influx of casualties due to injuries and burns.

According to OCHA The Nasser Medical Complex also appealed for people to donate blood.

Between 1 May and 26 May, OCHA reported that only 137 humanitarian aid missions were facilitated by the Israeli authorities to areas that require coordination across Gaza; 86 were “impeded after getting a green light or denied access to begin with, and 43 were cancelled by the organizers”.

Amid the ongoing destruction caused by nearly eight months of war in Gaza that began in response to Hamas-led terror attacks in southern Israel that killed some 1,250 people and saw 250 taken hostage, the WHO official stressed the need to support the future reconstruction of Gaza’s largely destroyed health system, to help the region to recover and support a sustainable peace.

“When you start thinking about the healing process and early recovery and reconstruction, we need to think completely different about getting the supplies into Gaza including, of course, specific medical and medical equipment and supplies,” Dr Peeperkorn insisted, before underscoring the historic difficulties associated with bringing in standard medical equipment:

“It took us almost two years to get three mobile X-rays. Every referral hospital everywhere around the world have a number of these mobile X-rays; they are in the referrals almost everywhere. So, it absolutely doesn't make sense and I just want to make this point, we all hope there will be a sustained ceasefire very soon.”
