Video Description: “The world cannot afford to watch the two-State solution disappear,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged the Security Council to take urgent action toward achieving a two-state solution, warning that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached levels “beyond imagination.”

The Security Council on Tuesday (Apr 29) held its quarterly open debate on “The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question,” chaired by French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Noël Barrot.

“Across the Middle East, people demand and deserve a better future, not endless conflict and suffering,” Guterres said, calling the region “at a hinge-point in history.” He stressed that peace is only possible by resolving “a core issue that this Security Council has affirmed and re-affirmed decade after decade… a two-state solution, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security, with Jerusalem as the capital of both states.”

With the situation in Gaza deteriorating, Guterres said, “For nearly two full months, Israel has blocked food, fuel, medicine and commercial supplies, depriving more than two million people of lifesaving relief. All while the world watches.” He condemned statements by Israeli officials suggesting the use of humanitarian aid as leverage, emphasizing, “Aid is non-negotiable.”

The Secretary-General cautioned against complacency, “This is not a time for ritualistically expressing support, ticking a box, and moving on. We are past the stage of ticking boxes – the clock is ticking. The two-State solution is near a point of no return.”

Riyad Mansour, Permanent Observer for Palestine, cited recent remarks by the U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he had urged Israel “to be good to Gaza” and called for allowing humanitarian aid. “We deeply hope that the United States, Egypt and Qatar, with the support of the international community as a whole, will be able to secure a return to the ceasefire to start bringing all this suffering to an end,” Mansour said.

Israel’s Deputy Permanent Representative Jonathan Miller rejected claims of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, stating, “Our assessments indicate there is currently no evidence of a humanitarian crisis.” He accused Hamas of diverting aid to its fighters and blamed the group for prolonging the war and holding 59 hostages in “inhumane conditions.” “Still, some in the international community continue to draw dangerous false equivalencies,” he said.

France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot warned of broader regional destabilization, “As we speak, Gaza lies devastated by war, Lebanon is only beginning to recover, Syria is embarking on a fragile and uncertain transition, and Iran continues its dangerous pursuit of nuclear armament.” He called for an immediate halt to hostilities, adding, “Our first priority is to stop the hostilities to end the suffering of civilian populations.”

*  President, Your Excellencies, I thank the French Presidency for convening this ministerial-level [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=5.2s)]
*  meeting on the Middle East, including the Palestinian question. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=12.88s)]
*  The region is undergoing fundamental shifts marked by violence and volatility, but also [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=19.62s)]
*  opportunity and potential. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=27.28s)]
*  In Lebanon, the ceasefire and territorial integrity must be respected and all commitments [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=31.96s)]
*  implemented. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=39.28s)]
*  In Syria, we must keep working to support the country's path towards a political transition [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=42.56s)]
*  that is inclusive of all segments of the Syrian population. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=49.6s)]
*  A platform that ensures accountability, fosters national healing, and lays the foundation [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  for Syria's long-term recovery and further integration into the international community. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=62.059999999999995s)]
*  This includes the situation in the occupied Syrian Golan, which remains precarious with [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=71.1s)]
*  significant violations of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement, with the continued presence [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=77.34s)]
*  of the Israel Defense Forces into the area of separation and their several strikes targeting [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=84.98s)]
*  locations across the ceasefire line. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=91.34s)]
*  Across the Middle East, people demand and deserve a better future, not endless conflict [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  and suffering. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  We must collectively work to ensure that this turbulent and transitional period meets those [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=104.76s)]
*  aspirations, and delivers justice, dignity, rights, security, and lasting peace. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=110.72s)]
*  It starts by recognizing two fundamental facts. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=118.92s)]
*  First, that the region is at a hinge point in history. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  And secondly, that truly sustainable Middle East peace hinges on one central question. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=127.68s)]
*  On a core issue that this Security Council has affirmed and reaffirmed decade after decade, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=135.6s)]
*  year after year. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=141.94s)]
*  A two-state solution, Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=144.16s)]
*  with Jerusalem as the capital of both states. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=151.34s)]
*  Mr. President, today the promise of a two-state solution is at risk of dwindling to the point [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=155.4s)]
*  of disappearance. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=162.20000000000002s)]
*  The political commitment to this long-standing goal is farther than it has ever been. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=164.52s)]
*  As a result, the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=171.76s)]
*  have been undermined, and the legitimate national aspirations of the Palestinians have been [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=177.82s)]
*  denied, while they endure Israel's continued presence that the International Court of Justice [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=183.16s)]
*  has found unlawful. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=189.52s)]
*  And since the horrific 7 October terror attacks by Hamas, it has gotten worse on every front. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=192.48s)]
*  First, the unrelenting conflict and devastation in Gaza, including the utterly inhumane conditions [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=199.76s)]
*  of life imposed on its people, who are repeatedly coming under attack, confined to smaller and [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=207.16s)]
*  smaller spaces, and deprived of life-saving relief. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=214.12s)]
*  In line with international law, the Security Council has rejected any attempt at demographic [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=219.44s)]
*  or territorial change in the Gaza Strip, including any actions that reduce its territory. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=224.94s)]
*  Gaza is and must remain an integral part of a future Palestinian state. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=232.6s)]
*  Second, in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Israeli military operations [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=239.12s)]
*  and the use of heavy weaponry in residential areas, forcible displacement, demolitionments, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=245.6s)]
*  movement restrictions, and settlement expansion are dramatically altering demographic and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=251.88s)]
*  geographic realities. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=258.0s)]
*  Settlements are being contained and coerced, contained in areas that are subject to increasing [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=261.32s)]
*  military operations, and where the Palestinian Authority is undergoing pressure, and coerced [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  out of areas where settlements are expanding. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=273.08s)]
*  Third, settler violence continues at alarmingly high levels in a climate of impunity, with [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=276.76s)]
*  the entire Palestinian communities facing repeated assaults and destruction, sometimes [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=283.48s)]
*  abetted by Israeli soldiers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=288.88s)]
*  Palestinian attacks against Israelis in both Israel and the occupied West Bank also continue. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=292.84s)]
*  Mr. President, the world cannot afford to watch the two-state solution disappear. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=299.6s)]
*  Political leaders face clear choices – the choice to be silent, the choice to acquiesce, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=306.04s)]
*  and the choice to act. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=312.48s)]
*  Mr. President, in Gaza there is no end in sight to the killing and misery. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=315.08s)]
*  The ceasefire had brought a glimmer of hope, the long sought release of hostages, and delivery [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=321.0s)]
*  of lifesaving humanitarian relief. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=326.24s)]
*  But those embers of opportunity were cruelly extinguished with the shattering of the ceasefire [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=329.48s)]
*  on 18 March. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=334.4s)]
*  Since then, almost 2,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza by Israeli strikes and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=336.92s)]
*  military operations, including women, children, journalists, and humanitarians. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=341.71999999999997s)]
*  Amass also continues to fire rockets towards Israel indiscriminately, while the hostages [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=348.03999999999996s)]
*  continue to be held in appalling conditions. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=353.76s)]
*  The humanitarian situation throughout the Gaza Strip has gone from bad to worse, to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=357.88s)]
*  beyond imagination. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  For nearly two full months, Israel has blocked food, fuel, medicine, and commercial supplies, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=365.52s)]
*  depriving more than two million people of lifesaving relief – all while the world [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=372.28s)]
*  watches. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=378.52s)]
*  I am alarmed by statements by Israeli government officials about the use of humanitarian aid [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=380.76s)]
*  as a tool for military pressure. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  Aid is non-negotiable. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  Israel must protect civilians and must agree to relieve shims and facilitate them. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=391.64s)]
*  I salute the women and men of the United Nations and all other humanitarian workers, especially [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  our Palestinian colleagues, who continue to work under fire and in incomprehensibly difficult [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=402.44s)]
*  conditions. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=408.2s)]
*  And I mourn all of the women and men of the United Nations who were killed, including [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  some with their families. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=414.84s)]
*  The entry of assistance must be restored immediately. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=418.2s)]
*  The safety of UN personnel and humanitarian partners must be guaranteed. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=421.8s)]
*  And UN agencies must be allowed to work in full respect of humanitarian principles, humanity, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=426.52s)]
*  impartiality, neutrality, and independence. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=432.24s)]
*  There must be no hindrance in humanitarian aid, including through the vital work of UNRWA. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=436.36s)]
*  We need the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=443.32s)]
*  And we need a permanent ceasefire. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=448.12s)]
*  It's time to stop the repeated displacement of the Gaza population, along with any question [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=451.32s)]
*  of forced displacement outside Gaza. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=456.64s)]
*  And the trampling of international law must end. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=460.08s)]
*  I call on member states to use their leverage to ensure that international law is respected [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  and impunity does not prevail. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=469.72s)]
*  This includes for the 19 March incidents for which Israel has now acknowledged responsibility [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=473.4s)]
*  in firing on a UN guest house, killing one colleague and injuring six others, the 23rd [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=479.4s)]
*  March killing of paramedics and other rescue words in Ra'afah, as well as many other cases. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=485.92s)]
*  There must be accountability across the board. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=493.28s)]
*  First, the President. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=497.88000000000005s)]
*  Advisory proceedings are ongoing at the International Court of Justice on the obligations of Israel [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=499.88000000000005s)]
*  as an occupying power and a member of the United Nations in relation to the presence [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=504.8s)]
*  and activities of the United Nations in and in relation to the occupied Palestinian territory. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=509.56s)]
*  In February, the United Nations Legal Council submitted the written statement to the Court, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=517.36s)]
*  and yesterday she made an oral statement before the Court, both of which on my behalf. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=523.16s)]
*  The statement to the Court includes points that I have made on a number of occasions, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=530.36s)]
*  specifically that all parties to conflict must comply with all their obligations and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  international law, including international human rights law and international humanitarian [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=539.88s)]
*  law. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=545.68s)]
*  That Israel, as an occupying power, is under the obligation to ensure food and medical [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  supplies of the population. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=551.8s)]
*  That Israel is an obligation to agree to and facilitate relief schemes in the occupied [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=554.4s)]

*  And I emphasize the obligation and international law to respect the privileges and the immunities [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=568.4799999999999s)]

*  I call on Member States to fully support all of these efforts. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=598.36s)]
*  Mr. President, in this period of turmoil and transition for the region, Member States must [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=604.0799999999999s)]
*  spell out how they will realize the commitment and promise of a two-state solution. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=610.28s)]
*  This is not a time for ritualistically expressing support, ticking a box and moving on. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=615.32s)]
*  We are past the stage of ticking boxes. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=622.76s)]
*  The clock is ticking. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=625.76s)]
*  The two-state solution is near a point of no return. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=628.0s)]
*  The international community has a responsibility to prevent perpetual occupation and violence. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=631.76s)]
*  My call to Member States is clear and urgent. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=638.0s)]
*  Take irreversible action towards implementing a two-state solution. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpoFkCIdQqc&t=641.84s)]
