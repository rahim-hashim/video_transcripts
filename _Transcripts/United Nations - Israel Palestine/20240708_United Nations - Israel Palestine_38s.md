Video Description: Nuseirat, middle Gaza area. In soaring summer temperatures, children have to wait in long queues to access water. Over the past 8 months, approximately 67% of water, sanitation facilities & infrastructure have been destroyed or damaged. UNRWA continues to provide deliver critical water, but it is becoming almost impossible to provide any kind of response due to the Israeli imposed siege, lack of fuel, lack of aid supplies, lack of safety and now further displacement orders that once again impact our ability to distribute aid.
