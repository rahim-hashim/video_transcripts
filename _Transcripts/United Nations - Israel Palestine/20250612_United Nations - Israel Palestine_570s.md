# Israel on Gaza - Media Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM)
*  Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=0.0s)]
*  will deliver a statement about last night's incident involving humanitarian workers from [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=5.04s)]
*  the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. He will also discuss this afternoon's General Assembly [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=10.08s)]
*  session and resolution vote. He will take your questions afterwards. Please remember [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=15.92s)]
*  to state your name and news outlet. Thanks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=20.16s)]
*  Good afternoon. Last night, Hamas murdered at least five Palestinian aid workers in Gaza. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=22.64s)]
*  The ambushed a bus clearly marked and carrying over two dozen humanitarian staff from the Gaza [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=32.96s)]
*  Humanitarian Foundation. Several others were injured. Some may have been taken hostage. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=38.88s)]
*  These were civilians. These are aid workers risking their lives to feed the people of Gaza. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=46.72s)]
*  Hamas guns them down in cold blood because they do not care about Palestinian lives. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  They do not care about life, period. It is an attack on humanitarian workers, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=59.68s)]
*  who the UN claims to care so deeply about. And I'm asking you today, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=66.47999999999999s)]
*  what is the condemnation from the Secretary General? What is the condemnation from the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=72.0s)]
*  United Nations? Moreover, the General Assembly will not meet to condemn that crime. It will [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=77.2s)]
*  not gather to denounce Hamas. Instead, it will probably pass a resolution, a resolution which [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  is a farce. It is a moral failure. It is a political stunt. If it passes, it will be remembered not at [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  a step toward peace, but at a disgraceful act of appeasement. It is a resolution that rewards [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=100.48s)]
*  terrorists and abandons their victims. Very soon, in about an hour, the G.A. will vote on a text [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=106.64s)]
*  that is a text that does not condemn Hamas for the atrocities it committed on October 7. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=115.2s)]
*  I encourage you to read the text and look for the condemnation. It does not make the release [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  of the 53 hostages still held in Gaza a condition for a ceasefire. It does not hold Hamas accountable. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=127.84s)]
*  The terrorists who started this war, prolong this war, and torture our hostages. This assembly [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=138.4s)]
*  has had over 20 months to say the words. Very simple. We condemn Hamas and we demand [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=146.88s)]
*  the immediate release of the hostages, but those words are nowhere to be found. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=153.76s)]
*  Instead, the G.A. will try to place all the pressure on us, on Israel, the only party that accepted [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  the proposal that was offered by the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt. Israel has accepted every proposal [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  under the framework Hamas has rejected them all, and yet this resolution acts as if that never [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=176.32s)]
*  happened. I say today to every delegation that will vote on this resolution, and we know that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=184.16s)]
*  it will pass. If you refuse to condemn Hamas, you commend them. If you fail to demand the release of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=190.56s)]
*  the hostages, you abandon them. If you try to erase October 7, you are complicit in allowing it [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=197.92s)]
*  to happen again. No General Assembly resolution, no moral failure, no hypocrisy will change the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  reality. Israel will do whatever it takes to bring all of them back home. Thank you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=215.04s)]
*  Thank you for the statement. What is the status of the Witkoff negotiations and the plan to bring [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=227.92s)]
*  the hostages home? Well, I saw Ambassador Witkoff last night, and we accepted the proposal he put [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=235.76s)]
*  on the table. It wasn't easy for us because it required releasing hundreds of terrorist murderers, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=242.48s)]
*  but we said yes. Hamas said no. There are still negotiations ongoing, and we will be there. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=248.72s)]
*  Once Hamas will say that they are willing to move forward, we will be there. We want to see more [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=255.76s)]
*  hostages coming back home. One minute. I will answer your question. Don't worry, please. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  That's it? That's the only question? Well, I will tell you that. You know, I cannot go into details, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=275.84s)]
*  but we are very serious when we say that we will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear capabilities. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=282.88s)]
*  President Trump and the administration are trying to negotiate with the Iranians. They said it will [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=288.32s)]
*  be for two months. I think that window is almost closing very soon. And if you will see that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=294.4s)]
*  diplomacy is not working, we will do whatever is necessary to make sure they don't obtain the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=301.52s)]
*  nuclear capabilities. We saw a few months ago they sent hundreds of ballistic missiles into Israel, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=306.56s)]
*  so we cannot wait for them to have nuclear capability. We will not be in that position. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=312.16s)]
*  How many nuclear weapons does Israel have? Is there anything imminent? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=317.12s)]
*  I will not get into that. Yes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=321.04s)]
*  We know the center of this issue now is what you mentioned, Hamas. But can you clarify a little bit [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=328.56s)]
*  what is Hamas now? Like who can you define as Hamas, the world's biggest guns who attack Israeli [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  civilians? Can you give us a little bit of elaboration? So Hamas today, it's not the same [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=341.28s)]
*  Hamas that was there in Gaza on October 7th. It's reduced, it's weak, but it's still there. We saw [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  what they did last night to the humanitarian workers. They are still trying to take advantage [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=353.84s)]
*  of the humanitarian aid. We will reveal some information that they're actually putting pressure [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=359.2s)]
*  on the NGOs inside Gaza. So they are still there. Very weak, but are still there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=364.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, if you see somebody carrying a gun and shooting civilians or aid workers, he's a terrorist. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=369.44s)]
*  And that's what we are doing. We are handing them down. Yes, I will answer your question, please. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=375.36s)]
*  Did you cut off the internet to stop more evidence of your war crimes from coming out, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  or are you escalating your murderous carnage in Gaza? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, I will answer your question. We haven't cut the internet in Gaza. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  There is internet in Gaza, if that's your question. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=395.28s)]
*  Didn't Netanyahu foreshadow that this would happen on May 14th? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=399.44s)]
*  Dropsite News is reporting that he indicated that Israel wanted to cut off the internet in Gaza. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  I can tell you that today there is internet in Gaza. And by the way, you can see the videos [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=409.6s)]
*  that are being sent out of Gaza every day, including the videos of what's happening to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=416.48s)]
*  Gazans who are standing in line to receive aid from the new foundation, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=421.12s)]
*  which is sponsored by the U.S., and they are being threatened by Hamas. And in some cases, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=425.12s)]
*  there are videos of Hamas shooting civilians because they are standing in line. So to your [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=430.48s)]
*  question, yes, there is internet in Gaza today. Please. Ambassador Adla Masoud from The National. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=436.16s)]
*  Will Israel be participating next week at the UN conference that's co-sponsored by France and [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=445.44s)]
*  Saudi Arabia? Absolutely not. We will not take part in this conference. It's a circus, and I was [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=450.96s)]
*  very happy to see that the United States decided also not to participate in this circus. And when [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=457.35999999999996s)]
*  Mr. Macron will arrive to the UN, I will ask him if he has solved all the problems in France, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=462.96s)]
*  in Europe, that he thinks that coming here to the UN and pushing this conference will actually be [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=468.79999999999995s)]
*  constructive. It's not constructive. Actually, it's hurting the negotiations because it allows [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=474.4s)]
*  Hamas to think that maybe something will come from the UN. We hope that Hamas will understand [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=480.56s)]
*  that they should accept the deal that was offered by the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=485.44s)]
*  That is the only way forward. Yes, please. Thank you. Yasser Abu Shabal, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=489.76s)]
*  who's leading a militia, recruited and financed and organized by Israel, who is attacking [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=497.12s)]
*  the people longing for food. And now you call them humanitarian workers. These are agents. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=504.64s)]
*  And the family of Abu Shabal clearly issued a statement disowning Yasser Abu Shabal. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=513.44s)]
*  And you tell here people, so they believe you, these are humanitarian workers. These are agents [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=520.16s)]
*  for Israel. You know that. Well, I don't know the details that you mentioned, but I can tell you one [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=525.68s)]
*  thing. There are forces in Gaza that don't want that the centers that were opened will succeed. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=530.7199999999999s)]
*  As of now, there are four centers. Three of them are operational. Today, three centers were opened. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=536.9599999999999s)]
*  And today, 36,000 meals were distributed by the fund to packages to people and families in Gaza. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=542.64s)]
*  So I don't know who is supporting or not supporting, but there are people who are [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=552.64s)]
*  trying to block civilians from getting the aid that is being distributed by the fund. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=556.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8C8DpeX3bM&t=561.04s)]
