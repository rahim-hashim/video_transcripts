Video Description: The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question - Security Council, 9650th meeting.
To be held following the adjournment of the 9649th meeting.

The Security Council today (10 Jun) adopted a resolution aimed at reaching a comprehensive ceasefire deal in three phases to end the war in Gaza, with US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield telling members "The fighting could stop today."

The United States-drafted text calls for Hamas to accept a ceasefire proposal announced on 31 May by President Joe Biden that has already been accepted by Israel.

Taking the floor before the vote, Thomas-Greenfield said, “we can help bring about peace by adopting the resolution before us, which calls on Hamas to take the ceasefire deal and urges both parties to fully implement the deals terms without delay and without conditions.”

Adopted by a large majority with 14 votes in favour and Russia abstaining, the resolution urges both parties to fully implement the terms of the proposal “without delay and without condition.”

Speaking again after the vote, Thomas-Greenfield said “today this Council sent a clear message to Hamas: accept the ceasefire deal on the table. Israel has already agreed to this deal and the fighting could stop today if Hamas would do the same.

Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya told the Council that “Hamas is called upon to accept this so called deal, but still there is no clarity regarding official agreement from Israel as is written in the resolution for the deal proposed by President Biden, given the many statements from Israel on the extension of the war until her mass is completely defeated.”

Israeli representative Mali Gal for her part said the loss of life in Gaza was “a tragedy, but if you don't put the blame on Hamas, you're advancing their strategy.”

Gal said, “Israel stands firm on our principles, and they have not changed. We will continue until all of the hostages are returned and until Hamas military and governing capabilities are dismantled. These have been our goals from day one. Just as President Biden stated on May 31, Hamas must not stay in power. Israel will not Hamas rearm or regroup so that Gaza can pose a threat to Israel. This is the unwavering goal that we are determined to achieve.”

The motion envisages three phases to ensure a lasting and comprehensive end to the fighting.

Phase one includes an “immediate, full, and complete ceasefire with the release of hostages including women, the elderly and the wounded, the return of the remains of some hostages who have been killed, and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners.”

It calls for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from “populated areas” of Gaza, the return of Palestinians to their homes and neighbourhoods throughout the enclave, including in the north, as well as the safe and effective distribution of humanitarian assistance at scale.

Phase two would see a permanent end to hostilities “in exchange for the release of all other hostages still in Gaza, and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.”

In phase three, “a major multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza” would begin and the remains of any deceased hostages still in the Strip would be returned to Israel.

The Council also underlined the proposal’s provision that if negotiations take longer than six weeks for phase one, the ceasefire will continue as long as negotiations continue.

In the resolution, the Security Council rejects any attempt at demographic or territorial change in the Gaza Strip, including any actions that reduce the territory of the enclave.

The text also reiterates the Council’s “unwavering commitment” to the vision of the two-State solution where two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders consistent with international law and relevant UN resolutions.

“In this regard stresses the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority,” the resolution added.

*  of the United States of America. Thank you, Mr. President. Colleagues, the last eight months [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=160.96s)]
*  have been nothing short of devastating for Israelis who lost loved ones on October 7th [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  when Hamas set this conflict into motion by carrying out acts of unthinkable violence. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=176.72s)]
*  For Israelis and people from more than 16 other countries whose sons and daughters, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=183.8s)]
*  brothers and sisters are still being held hostage by Hamas. For Israelis who face constant [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  rocket bombardment from Hamas, rockets that are fired off by terrorists hiding in civilian [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=200.96s)]
*  areas within Gaza. The past eight months have also been devastating for Palestinian [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=207.52s)]
*  civilians in Gaza. Nearly two million Palestinians have had to flee from one place to another [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=215.96s)]
*  in search of safety. And for so many, that safety has been elusive. My heart aches for [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  the young child who will forever be traumatized by seeing their family members killed. For [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=233.2s)]
*  all Palestinians who have lost loved ones in this fighting. And for humanitarian workers, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=240.2s)]
*  people who put their lives on the line to deliver aid to those in dire need who have [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=249.04s)]
*  been caught in the crosshairs at an unprecedented level. We continue to call on Israel to do [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=254.32s)]
*  everything possible to protect civilians. But let's not forget that Hamas's leaders [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=262.04s)]
*  are the ones who have put civilians at risk by hiding in tunnels underground and facilities [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=269.8s)]
*  that are near civilians and doing nothing to shelter those civilians. I've rarely ever [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=278.74s)]
*  seen anything so egregious and cowardly. Palestinian civilians are living through sheer hell through [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=288.08s)]
*  no fault of their own. And the humanitarian situation in Gaza has gotten worse and worse [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=295.96s)]
*  and worse. Families are living in makeshift conditions, unsure of what the next day holds. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=302.96s)]
*  Millions are grappling with the uncertainty of what will be left when they are allowed [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  to return home. I think about the parents trying to find food for their families, about [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=316.56s)]
*  the child who's been forced to stop their education, about the elderly person who no [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=323.24s)]
*  longer has access to essential medicines. Colleagues, after eight months of devastation [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=330.72s)]
*  and pain and trauma, what is needed now more than ever is for the fighting to end in a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=339.12s)]
*  sustainable way. The United States and every single country in this chamber want to see [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=344.56s)]
*  an immediate ceasefire with the release of hostages. We've heard those calls time and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=352.35999999999996s)]
*  time again since October 7th. Now the opportunity is here. We must seize it and we must speak [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  with one voice. For months the United States has worked around the clock alongside Egypt [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=369.64000000000004s)]
*  and Qatar to broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Because we know this is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=376.48s)]
*  the best way, actually the only way, to bring about a durable end to this war. Since the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=384.16s)]
*  brief ceasefire and hostage release last November, such a deal has proven elusive. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=393.24s)]
*  Why? Because Hamas has refused to accept any agreement. But right now there is another [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=399.92s)]
*  opportunity because as President Biden recently announced, Israel has agreed to a comprehensive [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  deal. That is the deal now on the table, which is nearly identical to Hamas's own proposals. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=416.08s)]
*  This deal would bring hostages home, ensure Israel's security, enable a surge of humanitarian [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=424.9s)]
*  relief and essential services including water and electricity, medical facilities and rubble [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=433.23999999999995s)]
*  removal to Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and set the stage for a political settlement [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  that provides a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike. This deal has been [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=448.04s)]
*  endorsed by countries across the region including Algeria, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  and the UAE, as well as by the G7 and those 16 countries whose citizens are being held [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=464.88s)]
*  by Hamas. Now we are all waiting. We are waiting on Hamas to agree to the ceasefire deal it [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=472.88s)]
*  claims to want. But we cannot afford to wait and wait and wait. With every passing day, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=482.28s)]
*  needless suffering continues. And so all of us as members of this council have a critical [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=489.28s)]
*  role to play. We can help bring about peace by adopting the resolution before us which [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=497.28s)]
*  calls on Hamas to take the ceasefire deal and urges both parties to fully implement [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=504.32s)]
*  the deal's terms without delay and without conditions. This is a deal that we are all [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=511.67999999999995s)]
*  waiting for. This resolution put forward by the United States after consultations with [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=519.28s)]
*  all council members makes clear that the world wants an immediate ceasefire with the release [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=527.28s)]
*  of hostages. The resolution also explains the framework of the deal. So let me take [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  a moment to lay that out. The first phase of this agreement would last for six weeks [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=541.76s)]
*  and the whole and complete ceasefire with the release of hostages including women, the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=548.76s)]
*  elderly, and the wounded. The return of the remains of some hostages who have been killed. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=556.76s)]
*  The exchange of Palestinian prisoners. The withdrawal of Israeli forces from the populated [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=564.76s)]
*  areas in Gaza. The return of Palestinian civilians to their homes and neighborhoods in all areas [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=570.8s)]
*  in the north. And the safe and effective distribution of humanitarian assistance in Gaza including [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=578.8s)]
*  housing units delivered by the international community. Importantly, the proposal says [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=587.04s)]
*  that if negotiations take longer than six weeks in phase one, the ceasefire will continue [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=594.56s)]
*  as long as negotiations continue. And the United States, Egypt, and Qatar would work [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=602.56s)]
*  to ensure negotiations keep going in good faith until all the agreements are reached [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=610.56s)]
*  and phase two begins. In the second phase upon agreement of the parties, there would [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  be a permanent end to hostilities in exchange for the release of all other hostages still [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=625.6s)]
*  in Gaza and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Phase three would see the start [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=633.12s)]
*  of a major multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of the remains of [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=642.4s)]
*  Israelis and others still in Gaza to their families. Colleagues, this is the deal on [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=649.92s)]
*  the table. Israel accepted this deal because it ensures its security. As President Biden [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=658.9599999999999s)]
*  made clear, Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another October 7th and the United [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=666.4s)]
*  States commitment to Israel's self-defense is ironclad. Colleagues, I'll also note that [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=673.72s)]
*  this resolution rejects any demographic or territorial changes in Gaza including any [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=680.9599999999999s)]
*  actions that reduce the territory of Gaza. And it reiterates this Council's unwavering [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=689.0s)]
*  commitment to the vision of a negotiated two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=696.0799999999999s)]
*  live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders consistent with international [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=704.0s)]
*  law and relevant UN resolutions. We all agree that a negotiated outcome along these lines [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=711.64s)]
*  is the only way forward. The draft before us also stresses the importance of unifying [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=720.1s)]
*  the West Bank and Gaza under the leadership of a reformed and revitalized Palestinian [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=726.9599999999999s)]
*  authority. And this text recalls resolutions this Council has adopted since October 7th [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=733.7199999999999s)]
*  including Resolution 2712, 2720, and 2728, all of which demanded that all parties to [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=742.04s)]
*  the conflict protect civilians. Colleagues, we need Hamas to agree to the ceasefire deal [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=749.28s)]
*  and then we need Israel and Hamas to implement the deal without delays or conditions. I don't [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=758.3199999999999s)]
*  want to keep waking up to news reports of more fighting and more loss of life. I don't [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=767.92s)]
*  want the families of hostages, many of whom I know personally, to ensure even one more [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=774.92s)]
*  day, to endure even one more day without their loved ones. I don't want another Palestinian [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=782.12s)]
*  family, including the relatives of people I have met with, to experience any more loss [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=790.4799999999999s)]
*  or suffering. I want to see an enduring ceasefire where Israel is safe, safe from the threat [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=797.48s)]
*  of further terrorist attacks and rocket fire, and Palestinians can begin rebuilding their [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=806.96s)]
*  lives in safety and security. I want to see families reunite it. I want to see Palestinian [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=814.5600000000001s)]

*  world, and most of all those living under this terrible conflict. And so, Colleagues, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  we must seize the opportunity before us. We must speak out with one voice in support [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=845.96s)]
*  of peace. I urge all Council members to vote yes on this resolution, to vote yes for peace. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=853.36s)]

*  Hamas. Accept the ceasefire deal on the table. Israel has already agreed to this deal and [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=956.6s)]
*  the fighting could stop today if Hamas would do the same. I repeat, the fighting could [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=964.6s)]
*  stop today. This Council and countries across the region and the world have endorsed this [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=971.6s)]
*  agreement. Hamas can now see that the international community is united. United behind a deal [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=978.6s)]
*  that will save lives and help Palestinian civilians in Gaza start to rebuild and heal. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=986.6s)]
*  United behind a deal that will reunite hostages with their families after eight months in [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=994.6s)]
*  captivity. United behind a deal that would lead to a more secure Israel and unlock the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1001.6s)]
*  possibility of more progress, including calm along Israel's northern border with Lebanon. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1009.6s)]
*  We cannot forget the Israelis displaced from their homes in northern Israel under threat [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1018.6s)]
*  from Hezbollah. These attacks from terrorist groups backed by Iran must stop. They have [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1025.6s)]
*  to stop. Colleagues, the ceasefire deal will pave the way toward an enduring cessation [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1033.6s)]
*  of hostilities and a better future for all. As President Biden acknowledged just the other [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1039.6s)]
*  day, the Palestinian people have endured sheer hell in this war started by Hamas. There's [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1046.6s)]
*  an opportunity to chart a different course. Hamas must take it. Egypt and Qatar have assured [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1054.6s)]
*  the United States that they are continuing to work to ensure that Hamas engages constructively [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1061.6s)]
*  and the United States will help ensure that Israel lives up to its obligations as well, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1070.04s)]
*  assuming Hamas accepts the deal. Over the past eight months, this council has often [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1076.6399999999999s)]
*  faced divisions and the world has taken notice with understandable frustration. But there's [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1083.3999999999999s)]
*  another side to this story because today we adopted the fourth resolution on this conflict. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1090.4s)]
*  For the fourth time we have spoken out and made clear the only way to end this cycle [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1098.44s)]
*  of violence and build a durable peace is through a political settlement, one that ensures Israel [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1105.44s)]
*  no longer lives in the shadow of a terrorist group and is further integrated with the region. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1112.8400000000001s)]
*  And I want to make clear that Israel will always have the right to defend itself against [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1120.8000000000002s)]
*  threats to its security and to bring those responsible for October 7th to justice. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1125.0800000000002s)]
*  Colleagues today, we also reaffirmed our commitment to the vision of two states where Israelis [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1134.52s)]
*  and Palestinians live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders, consistent [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1140.2s)]
*  with international law and relevant UN resolutions, and where revitalized and reformed Palestinian [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1147.0800000000002s)]
*  authority leads a unified West Bank and Gaza. This is the future that we must help bring [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1155.0800000000002s)]
*  about and this all starts with the ceasefire deal that this council endorsed today and [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1164.44s)]
*  that this council unequivocally called on Hamas to accept. Colleagues today we voted [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1172.28s)]
*  for peace. Thank you Mr. President. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1180.04s)]
*  I thank the representative of the United States for their statement. I now give the floor [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1184.44s)]
*  to the representative of Algeria. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1190.0800000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, our thoughts are with the more than 37,000 Palestinians who have been killed [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1195.08s)]
*  by the Israeli occupying forces. The Israeli occupation forces have been killed by the [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1214.84s)]
*  Syrian occupation forces during this last eight months. Over 20,000 of them are women [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1225.08s)]
*  and children. These martyrs for us are alive with their lords. They are watching over us [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1239.8s)]
*  from heaven. Mr. President, we Algerians deeply feel the suffering of Palestinians and with [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1246.8s)]
*  our own history of struggle against colonial occupation we fully understand and support [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1253.8s)]
*  the Palestinian occupation. We are very proud of the Palestinian occupation. We are proud [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1267.32s)]
*  of the Palestinian occupation. We support their legitimate and just demands. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1283.8s)]
*  As a free and dignified people, the Palestinians will never accept living under occupation. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1295.36s)]
*  They will never abdicate their fight for liberation. From the start of our mandate in the Council, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1302.36s)]
*  our objective has been and remains clear and unwavering to halt the massacres committed [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1309.36s)]
*  by the Israeli occupation forces. We are proud of the Palestinian occupation. We are proud [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1320.9199999999998s)]
*  of the Palestinian occupation. Threeooo too many economies in the world [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1328.7s)]
*  have been destroyed because of the Jewish occupation. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1341.98s)]
*  sole guiding principle has been the preservation [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1351.94s)]
*  of Palestinian lives. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1358.76s)]
*  We cannot stand by while the Israeli occupying forces [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1363.8600000000001s)]
*  continue to exterminate Palestinians. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1369.22s)]
*  We also cannot remain silent in the face [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1374.5800000000002s)]
*  of this collective punishment. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1380.02s)]
*  To us, Mr. President, Palestinian lives matter. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1384.06s)]
*  Palestinian lives matter. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1391.78s)]
*  We voted in favor of the draft resolution [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1398.02s)]
*  submitted by the United States. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1402.4199999999998s)]
*  Because we believe it can represent a step [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1406.14s)]
*  toward an immediate and lasting ceasefire. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1411.7800000000002s)]
*  And I would like to extend our gratitude [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1418.3000000000002s)]
*  to the U.S. delegation, especially Ambassador Linda [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1423.8200000000002s)]
*  Thomas-Greenfield for their diligent efforts. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1429.38s)]
*  And for addressing some of our concerns in the final text. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1435.38s)]
*  Algeria engaged during the negotiation process [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1444.26s)]
*  in good faith, working closely with Palestinian [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1449.98s)]
*  and mediators to achieve a resolution that ensure [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1457.22s)]
*  an immediate ceasefire and hopefully [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1463.22s)]
*  will have a tangible impact on the ground. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1469.34s)]
*  Like any other product of the Security Council, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1474.7s)]
*  this text is not perfect. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1481.8600000000001s)]
*  But it offers a glimmer of hope to the Palestinians. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1486.42s)]
*  As the alternative is continued killing and suffering [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1493.22s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1501.54s)]
*  We voted for this text to give diplomacy a chance [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1505.02s)]
*  to reach an agreement that would end the aggression [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1512.26s)]
*  against the Palestinian people that has lasted [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1518.02s)]
*  for far too long. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1524.1s)]
*  It's time to hold the killing. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1527.86s)]
*  Mr. President, this resolution ensure that first, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1534.34s)]
*  the immediate ceasefire will continue [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1539.34s)]
*  as long as negotiation continue. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1544.34s)]
*  Mediators, the United States, Egypt and Qatar [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1550.06s)]
*  will work tirelessly to reach an agreement [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1557.1399999999999s)]
*  on the second phase of the ceasefire. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1562.1399999999999s)]
*  This was one of our key concerns. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1566.14s)]
*  Second, this resolution guarantees the return of Gazans [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1573.0200000000002s)]
*  to their home and neighborhood, including their homes. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1582.26s)]
*  The resolution will ensure that the ceasefire [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1591.0600000000002s)]
*  will continue including the north of Gaza [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1596.66s)]
*  within six weeks. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1602.18s)]
*  It counters the occupying powers attempt [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1606.0600000000002s)]
*  to empty the north of Gaza of its inhabitants. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1612.18s)]
*  Third, the resolution sends a clear message. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1619.8200000000002s)]
*  No change to Gaza's demographics or territory [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1627.14s)]
*  will be permitted. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1632.3400000000001s)]
*  So no buffer zones will be established in Gaza [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1634.5400000000002s)]
*  and the Israeli occupation forces must withdraw [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1642.9s)]
*  from the entire Gaza Strip. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1649.22s)]
*  Fourth, given the unprecedented level of destruction [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1651.74s)]
*  in Gaza, which will take decades to clear, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1662.1000000000001s)]
*  the international community through this resolution [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1670.14s)]
*  reaffirms its commitment to the Palestinian people [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1675.7s)]
*  and for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1681.6200000000001s)]
*  Guided by its solidarity with the Palestinian people, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1688.1000000000001s)]
*  my country, Algeria, will do its part [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1695.66s)]
*  and contribute to the international reconstruction effort. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1700.54s)]
*  Fifth, this resolution reaffirms [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1706.1399999999999s)]
*  the international community's commitment [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1712.3s)]
*  to the establishment of a Palestinian state. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1715.78s)]
*  Action by the occupying power to undermine [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1721.54s)]
*  the establishment of Palestinian state are futile. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1726.62s)]
*  The resolute commitment of the international community [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1732.1399999999999s)]
*  will make the Palestinian state a reality. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1737.2199999999998s)]
*  Soon, Mr. President, the continued barbarity [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1743.34s)]
*  by the occupying forces will only result [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1753.06s)]
*  in more senseless death as we witnessed this weekend [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1758.8999999999999s)]
*  in the Nusayrat refugee camp. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1767.62s)]
*  Such crimes against humanity cannot go unfinished [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1772.5s)]
*  for those killed in Nusayrat [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1780.4199999999998s)]
*  and in all occupied Palestinian territories. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1784.3400000000001s)]
*  For the Palestinian children and women, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1790.3000000000002s)]
*  we reaffirm Algeria's commitment to accountability. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1795.26s)]
*  For those responsible for killings of Palestinians, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1803.98s)]
*  and of Palestinians, they will face justice. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1809.8600000000001s)]
*  No one will be immune. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1816.1s)]
*  None will be above the law. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1820.7s)]
*  To conclude, Mr. President, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1832.7s)]
*  if the International Court of Justice order [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1835.22s)]
*  are not enforced and those responsible [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1840.74s)]
*  are not held accountable, sooner or later, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1849.1399999999999s)]
*  a new genocide looms on the horizon. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1857.54s)]
*  Mr. President, it is evident that unless the root causes [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1865.3s)]
*  of the Palestinian tragedy are properly addressed, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1879.1s)]

*  Therefore, our first objective must be the end [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1898.02s)]
*  of the occupation, and my country, Algeria, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1908.06s)]
*  will remain steadfast in supporting [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1914.62s)]

*  The UK voted for this resolution as an important step [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1955.98s)]
*  in bringing about an end to the conflict [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1961.86s)]
*  that has raged since the horrific attacks [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1965.66s)]
*  on the 7th of October and moving towards a lasting peace. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1969.18s)]
*  The situation in Gaza is catastrophic, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1975.02s)]
*  and the suffering has gone on for far too long. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1979.02s)]
*  The deal on the table is something [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1984.42s)]
*  that the UK has long called for. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1986.9s)]

*  bring about an immediate ceasefire, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=1995.6200000000001s)]

*  We call upon the parties to seize this opportunity [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2012.94s)]
*  and move towards lasting peace, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2017.7s)]

*  Far too many lives have been lost already. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2029.74s)]
*  There is desperate need for humanitarian assistance in Gaza, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2034.02s)]
*  and hostages have now been held for over eight months. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2040.02s)]
*  News of the rescue of four hostages [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2046.78s)]

*  both Palestinian and Israeli, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2062.82s)]
*  already lost and affected by the conflict. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2065.82s)]
*  We must secure the release of all hostages [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2070.42s)]
*  and end the fighting. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2074.7s)]
*  The UK applauds the diplomatic efforts [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2078.82s)]
*  of Qatar, Egypt, and the United States [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2081.62s)]
*  in negotiating the deal that is on the table. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2086.58s)]
*  We note that Israel has accepted the deal [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2090.74s)]
*  and call upon Hamas to accept the terms [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2094.74s)]
*  and bring an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2099.3399999999997s)]
*  and the hostages that remain in detention. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2103.7799999999997s)]
*  We must then see a rapid increase [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2108.42s)]
*  in the flows of humanitarian aid [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2110.8599999999997s)]
*  throughout the entire Gaza Strip, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2113.22s)]
*  with the opening of all border crossings [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2116.54s)]
*  and facilitation of the minimum operating requirements [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2119.7799999999997s)]
*  of the UN and international humanitarian organizations. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2124.4599999999996s)]
*  The UK remains in steadfast support [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2130.54s)]
*  of a credible and irreversible pathway [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2133.9399999999996s)]
*  towards a two-state solution, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2137.02s)]
*  with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2139.98s)]

*  and the wider region. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2148.54s)]
*  As we have made clear, a sustainable peace [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2153.1800000000003s)]
*  must also include Hamas no longer being in control of Gaza [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2156.94s)]
*  and international support for the Palestinian Authority [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2162.26s)]
*  so that it can resume governance [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2166.62s)]

*  across the West Bank and Gaza. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2171.7s)]
*  The UK stands ready to support this. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2174.7799999999997s)]
*  President, the UK has long advocated for a deal [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2178.9s)]
*  such as the one on the table. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2184.46s)]
*  This conflict has gone on for far too long. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2187.3399999999997s)]
*  Now, more than ever, is the time for diplomacy. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2191.54s)]

*  towards achieving a comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2227.2200000000003s)]
*  Malta voted in favor of this resolution [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2230.78s)]
*  as the crisis remains untenable. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2233.82s)]
*  We welcome this council's ability to support a resolution [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2236.7400000000002s)]
*  that aims to put an end to this harrowing cycle of violence. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2240.5s)]

*  and permanent ceasefire, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2248.82s)]
*  the release of all hostages held, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2251.1s)]
*  and a comprehensive response [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2253.62s)]
*  to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2255.38s)]
*  We fully support initiatives [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2258.6600000000003s)]
*  which bring us closer to these imperatives. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2260.5s)]
*  On Saturday, we welcomed the news that four hostages [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2264.42s)]
*  abducted during the 7th October attack by Hamas [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2268.1800000000003s)]
*  were successfully rescued by Israeli forces. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2271.54s)]
*  All those that remain in captivity [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2275.06s)]
*  must be immediately and unconditionally released. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2277.1400000000003s)]
*  However, images from the aftermath [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2281.38s)]
*  of the Israeli operation into a Nusayrat refugee camp [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2284.02s)]
*  in which scores of Palestinians, including children, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2288.3s)]
*  were reportedly killed are truly horrifying. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2292.1s)]
*  This incident is not isolated [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2296.02s)]
*  and is emblematic of the scale of suffering in Gaza. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2298.74s)]
*  We unequivocally stress [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2303.54s)]
*  that international humanitarian law [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2305.7s)]
*  must be respected by all parties. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2307.7s)]
*  We further emphasize the need to address [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2310.78s)]
*  the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2313.14s)]
*  Humanitarian aid must be delivered at scale [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2316.74s)]
*  into and throughout the Gaza Strip. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2320.02s)]
*  Crucially, aid distribution must also be safe and unhindered. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2323.46s)]
*  We need full compliance and implementation [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2328.94s)]
*  of the relevant council resolutions [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2332.2599999999998s)]
*  and the full, immediate, and effective implementation [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2335.1s)]
*  of the orders of the ICJ. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2338.58s)]
*  A ceasefire, as outlined in the proposal, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2341.38s)]
*  remains essential to dealing with those deepening [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2343.94s)]
*  and with these deepening [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2347.22s)]
*  and immediate term humanitarian concerns. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2349.82s)]
*  The ceasefire proposal would also lead [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2353.42s)]
*  to the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2356.22s)]
*  from the full territory of Gaza [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2358.9s)]
*  and the space to mount [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2361.3s)]
*  an international reconstruction effort for Gaza. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2362.66s)]
*  Most importantly, it would put the parties [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2366.22s)]
*  on the path towards reviving a credible political process [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2369.18s)]
*  for a lasting and sustainable peace, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2373.46s)]

*  We urge both parties to the conflict to accept [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2379.7s)]
*  and fulfill the terms of the ceasefire proposal [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2383.3799999999997s)]
*  without delay and without condition. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2386.14s)]
*  It is high time to put an end [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2389.22s)]
*  to this unprecedented suffering [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2391.2999999999997s)]

*  and implement without delay or conditions [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2431.78s)]
*  the three-phase proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2434.3s)]
*  This plan currently represents the best chance [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2439.66s)]
*  for a way out of the appalling violence raging in the Middle East, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2442.1s)]
*  which has claimed tens of thousands of civilian victims [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2446.74s)]
*  since the acts of terror committed by Hamas [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2450.14s)]
*  on the 7th of October, which we strongly condemned. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2452.62s)]
*  Switzerland has consistently called for full respect [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2456.78s)]
*  by the parties with their obligations under international law, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2460.78s)]
*  including international humanitarian and human rights law. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2464.86s)]
*  This call was clearly reflected in resolutions 2712, 2720, and 2728. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2468.98s)]
*  Through the latter, the Council demanded an immediate ceasefire [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2476.1800000000003s)]
*  to be respected by all parties and to lead to a lasting ceasefire. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2480.7400000000002s)]
*  The adopted resolution is in keeping with the logic of respect [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2486.86s)]
*  for international law. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2490.2200000000003s)]
*  It calls upon the parties to implement a ceasefire [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2491.7400000000002s)]
*  without delay or conditions, to release the hostages, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2494.02s)]
*  and to facilitate the supply of humanitarian aid [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2497.34s)]
*  through all possible routes and crossing points [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2499.94s)]
*  and throughout the Gaza Strip. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2503.54s)]
*  Switzerland deeply regrets, however, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2507.7400000000002s)]
*  that despite the request of several delegations, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2509.38s)]
*  including our own, the call for respect for international law [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2511.6600000000003s)]
*  and in particular international humanitarian law [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2514.94s)]
*  and human rights law did not find a place in the text [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2517.34s)]
*  voted on today as it had in previous resolutions. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2521.1400000000003s)]
*  The events of the last few days have demonstrated once again [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2525.86s)]
*  that respect by the parties to the conflict [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2528.58s)]
*  for their obligations under international law is vital [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2531.26s)]
*  if further bloodshed and civilian deaths are to be avoided. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2534.6600000000003s)]
*  We are relieved that four hostages have, after many months, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2539.22s)]
*  been reunited with their families and once again call [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2543.18s)]
*  for the immediate release of all those still being held captive. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2546.54s)]
*  However, we are alarmed by the very high number [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2550.98s)]
*  of Palestinian casualties reported in recent days, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2554.02s)]
*  particularly during the rescue operation in Nusayrat. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2558.1s)]
*  We reiterate that a distinction must be made at all times [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2562.22s)]
*  between civilians and combatants [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2565.62s)]
*  and between civilian objects and military targets. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2567.9s)]
*  President, with its positive vote today, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2572.66s)]
*  Switzerland has confirmed its support for the negotiations [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2574.8199999999997s)]
*  led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2578.06s)]
*  whose efforts we commend. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2582.02s)]
*  We now call on Israel and Hamas to conclude [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2584.9s)]
*  and implement this agreement as soon as possible. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2587.98s)]
*  The Council's collective support for such an agreement [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2590.98s)]
*  is aimed at finally putting an end to human suffering, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2593.9s)]
*  halting the continuing escalation of violence in the region, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2598.06s)]
*  and laying the foundations for a solution [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2600.94s)]
*  of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2603.78s)]
*  living side by side in peace [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2606.46s)]
*  within secure and recognized borders. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2608.7000000000003s)]
*  I thank you. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2610.98s)]
*  I thank the representative of Switzerland [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2612.42s)]
*  for their statement. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2614.62s)]
*  I now give the floor to the representative of Japan. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2615.86s)]
*  Japan. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2619.14s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2621.8599999999997s)]
*  The devastating conflict in Gaza has gone for far too long, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2624.3399999999997s)]
*  with too much suffering and loss of innocent life. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2629.46s)]
*  The catastrophic humanitarian situation is indescribable. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2633.7s)]
*  Many of the hostages are still being held [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2638.42s)]
*  in appalling conditions. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2641.1s)]
*  Japan greatly appreciates the vigorous diplomatic efforts [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2643.8199999999997s)]
*  by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2647.26s)]
*  and we strongly support the three-stage proposal [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2650.6600000000003s)]
*  outlined by President Biden. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2654.0200000000004s)]
*  If Hamas accepts the deal and both parties commit themselves [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2657.1400000000003s)]
*  to negotiations based on this proposal immediately [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2660.94s)]
*  and with sincerity, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2664.46s)]
*  it will finally bring about the long-awaited ceasefire [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2666.26s)]
*  and release of hostages. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2670.26s)]
*  This is what the Security Council should call upon right now, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2672.98s)]
*  and thus we voted in favor of the resolution proposed by the U.S. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2676.5s)]
*  The resolution was adopted, and this opportunity must be seized. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2683.2200000000003s)]
*  Japan hopes this strong pronouncement by the Council [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2689.86s)]
*  will help the parties finally reach a ceasefire deal [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2694.9s)]
*  that would allow for the release of all hostages [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2698.46s)]
*  and influx of critical humanitarian aid at scale. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2701.98s)]
*  Today, the Security Council has upheld its responsibility [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2706.7400000000002s)]
*  to maintain international peace and security [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2710.3s)]
*  by expressing our strong desire [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2713.18s)]
*  to see the end of a vicious cycle of violence. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2715.54s)]
*  This Council must stand ready to take necessary action [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2720.3s)]
*  further down, just as we have done today. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2723.38s)]
*  The people of Gaza and the hostages still held by Hamas [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2727.46s)]
*  are counting on us. I thank you, President. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2732.7400000000002s)]
*  I thank the representative of Japan for their statement. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2737.38s)]
*  I now give the floor to the representative of Slovenia. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2740.62s)]
*  Thank you, President. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2745.5s)]
*  Slovenia voted in favor of the resolution 2735, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2747.3s)]
*  focusing on the comprehensive ceasefire deal in Gaza. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2751.34s)]
*  We would like to thank the U.S. as a penholder for their efforts. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2755.38s)]
*  Since the start of this conflict, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2760.1s)]
*  Slovenia has been calling for a strong, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2761.98s)]
*  united voice from the Council on this issue. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2764.6600000000003s)]
*  We believe that calls by the international community, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2768.14s)]
*  efforts by mediators and those of a bilateral nature [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2771.42s)]
*  are intertwined and should be mutually reinforcing. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2775.02s)]
*  We deeply appreciate the determination of Egypt, Qatar, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2778.98s)]
*  and the United States and at reaching this deal. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2781.86s)]
*  The Security Council is the primary body entrusted [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2786.1800000000003s)]
*  with the maintenance of international peace and security. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2788.78s)]
*  Its voice should be clear and united. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2792.3s)]
*  This is why we welcome the adoption of the resolution, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2795.7000000000003s)]
*  seeking the Council's endorsement of this deal. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2799.1400000000003s)]
*  We call on both parties to accept it and implement it fully and immediately. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2802.9s)]
*  Let me underline our consistent call for the full respect of international law, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2810.26s)]
*  including international humanitarian law and international human rights law. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2814.82s)]
*  International law is clear. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2819.7s)]
*  It prohibits hostage-taking. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2822.18s)]
*  It prohibits the denial of humanitarian access to civilians [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2824.66s)]
*  and attacks against humanitarian workers. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2828.58s)]
*  It includes the right to voluntary return of displaced persons. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2831.7799999999997s)]
*  My point, colleagues, is that many of the elements of this deal [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2836.18s)]
*  should already be taken place. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2839.7s)]
*  As should have been the case for the implementation [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2842.5s)]
*  of the previous three Council resolutions, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2844.9s)]
*  along with the ICJ orders on provisional measures. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2847.2200000000003s)]
*  Mr. President, we have been saying this for months now. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2852.42s)]
*  The suffering in Gaza must end. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2856.1800000000003s)]
*  We have been constantly calling for immediate release of hostages. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2859.38s)]
*  However, military operations for the release of hostages, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2863.62s)]
*  leaving hundreds of civilians killed and injured [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2868.42s)]
*  like the one in Nusayrat refugee camp on Saturday, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2870.9s)]
*  cannot be the new normal. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2874.34s)]
*  The principles of international humanitarian law [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2877.0600000000004s)]
*  and human rights law apply to hostage rescue operations as well. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2880.34s)]
*  The denial of aid to civilians, including women, children, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2885.46s)]
*  persons with disabilities and older persons. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2889.0600000000004s)]
*  Humanitarian and UN personnel killed. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2892.98s)]
*  UN premises targeted. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2896.9s)]
*  Hospitals sieged. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2899.5400000000004s)]
*  Children's limbs amputated without anesthesia. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2901.46s)]
*  Women giving birth without appropriate assistance. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2905.14s)]
*  Mass graves. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2908.5s)]
*  Civilian areas in Gaza and in Israel targeted, attacked and destroyed. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2910.42s)]
*  None of this should be taking place. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2916.18s)]
*  Mr. President, photos of children, some of them born during this war, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2919.7s)]

*  It is for these reasons that we once again call for an immediate ceasefire. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2932.74s)]
*  This is the first step towards achieving a comprehensive solution. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2938.42s)]
*  It is for this reason we support an international peace conference [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2942.66s)]
*  under the auspices of the United Nations. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2946.42s)]
*  It is for these reasons that we underscore our commitment [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2949.46s)]
*  to the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2953.06s)]

*  including East Jerusalem, under the Palestinian Authority. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2960.1s)]
*  Everyone has their part to play and every step contributes to the peace process. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2964.98s)]
*  In our opinion, only two sovereign, sovereign and equal states can make this peace happen. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2970.8999999999996s)]
*  It is for that reason that my country last week recognized Palestine [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2978.5s)]
*  as an independent and sovereign state and we call on others to follow suit. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2982.5s)]
*  So that the future generations in Israel and Palestine can live side by side in peace, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=2987.2999999999997s)]

*  President, the conflicts in Gaza have lasted over eight months, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3012.66s)]
*  killing more than 37,000 Palestinian people and leaving over 2 million people in unprecedented [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3021.2999999999997s)]
*  humanitarian catastrophe. Israel's massive offensive against Ra'a and its attack on [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3029.06s)]
*  Nusayrat refugee camp over the past two days have caused additional major casualties. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3036.18s)]
*  Facing such a human tragedy, the international community reached overwhelming agreement long ago. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3043.3799999999997s)]
*  Both the GAESS and the Security Council have adopted multiple resolutions which contain [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3052.1s)]
*  clear-cut provisions, namely immediate, unconditional and lasting ceasefire, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3057.46s)]
*  immediate release of all hostages and the Palestinian detainees, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3065.62s)]
*  guarantee for smooth, unimpeded and adequate humanitarian relief into Gaza [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3070.98s)]
*  and its timely delivery to those in need, protection of civilians, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3077.54s)]
*  and strict accountability for acts in Gaza in breach of international humanitarian law. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3084.02s)]
*  The U.S. leader announced on May 31st the Gaza ceasefire proposal. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3091.94s)]
*  Then the U.S. submitted a draft resolution to the Security Council urging both Israel and Hamas to [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3097.78s)]
*  accept the ceasefire proposal and fully implement its terms without delay and without condition. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3104.9s)]
*  By common sense, if the parties concerned reach agreement first, which is then followed by the [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3112.9s)]
*  Council's action of endorsement, such a course of action would be more appropriate. However, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3118.9s)]
*  if the Council's action is conducive to reaching agreement [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3125.3s)]
*  and conducive to immediate realization of permanent ceasefire, such an action would still be a positive one. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3132.34s)]
*  Based on the views of the Council members, the sponsor has revised the draft resolution. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3143.78s)]
*  However, the draft is still ambiguous in many aspects. We still have valid concerns on whether [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3148.82s)]
*  the parties concerned will accept the ceasefire proposal and whether the three-phase arrangement [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3156.5s)]
*  can be carried out smoothly. Meanwhile, we have noted that the proposal says if the negotiations [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3161.38s)]
*  take longer than six weeks for phase one, the ceasefire will still continue as long as [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3171.2200000000003s)]
*  negotiations continue and relevant parties are ready to work to ensure negotiations keep going [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3176.82s)]
*  until all the agreements are reached. The sponsor has also indicated that Israel has accepted the [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3184.7400000000002s)]
*  ceasefire proposal. Our understanding is that as long as ceasefire is achieved, no more fighting [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3191.94s)]
*  will be launched again. Immediate realization of permanent ceasefire, this has been the strong appeal [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3200.02s)]
*  of China and the Council members for months, and this has been the most pressing aspiration of Gaza [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3209.22s)]
*  civilians in deep sufferings. From the perspective of the urgent need to stop more killing and to [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3216.18s)]
*  alleviate humanitarian catastrophe, China voted in favour. President, all Council resolutions are [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3224.98s)]
*  legally binding. The resolution just adopted is equally binding as Council resolutions 2712, 2720 [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3234.7400000000002s)]
*  and 2728. All of them should be implemented in a comprehensive and effective manner. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3245.22s)]
*  We hope that the sponsor will work sincerely in an impartial and responsible manner to push [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3255.06s)]
*  for immediate realization of permanent ceasefire. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3263.54s)]
*  China will work with all parties to push for early stop of fighting in Gaza and bring the [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3269.14s)]
*  Palestinian-Israeli question back to the right track of the two-state solution as early as possible. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3276.5s)]
*  Thank you, President. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3282.2599999999998s)]
*  I thank the representative of China for the statement. I now give the floor to the [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3284.74s)]
*  representative of Guyana. Thank you, Mr. President. 247 days have passed since Hamas's [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3290.98s)]
*  horrific attack on Israel and since Israel launched a war on Gaza unprecedented in scale [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3300.4199999999996s)]
*  and impact. The death toll from this war is staggering with thousands of Palestinians [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3307.7s)]
*  killed in barbaric ways. The humanitarian situation is catastrophic and Gaza has been made an abyss [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3313.62s)]
*  of destruction. Despite the adoption of resolutions both by this Council and the General Assembly [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3321.06s)]
*  calling inter alia for the protection of civilians and a ceasefire, the war has persisted with [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3328.8999999999996s)]
*  civilians continuing to face grave danger. Today, Guyana voted in favor of the resolution [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3335.7s)]
*  tabled by the United States because we viewed it as another valuable contribution, this time by the [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3343.14s)]
*  United States, Egypt, and Qatar towards achieving the end of the war and bringing relief to the [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3350.1s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of civilians suffering in Gaza and to the Israeli hostages and their families. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3357.06s)]
*  Specifically, Guyana notes that the ceasefire proposal with which the resolution treats aligns [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3365.46s)]
*  in several ways with previous resolutions adopted by this Council. It is still critical, however, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3372.5s)]
*  for the Security Council in keeping with its primary responsibility under the Charter for the [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3379.7s)]
*  maintenance of international peace and security to redouble efforts towards the urgent achievement [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3386.42s)]
*  of a ceasefire, the release of all hostages in Gaza and of Palestinians illegally detained, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3393.2999999999997s)]
*  and for a surge in humanitarian assistance in Gaza. These are the steps needed to bring immediate [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3400.4199999999996s)]
*  relief to civilians being ravaged by Israel's eight-month-old war on Gaza. These steps are also [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3407.2999999999997s)]
*  foundational to the reconstruction of Gaza and more broadly to reviving the vision of the two-state [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3415.06s)]
*  solution, which is the only just and comprehensive resolution of the Palestinian question. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3421.86s)]
*  Mr. President, as Guyana supported the resolution adopted today, we wish to reflect on three key [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3429.1400000000003s)]
*  elements not included in this resolution but warranting continued attention. First, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3436.82s)]
*  this resolution was considered in the context of the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3444.26s)]
*  one of the most egregious consequences of the war. For Guyana, the ceasefire proposal is [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3450.58s)]
*  logically seen as a response to inter alia the unprecedented humanitarian situation in Gaza. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3457.06s)]
*  Second, we reiterate our demand for adherence to international law, including international [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3464.66s)]
*  humanitarian law. As Guyana has consistently pointed out, this war is characterized by the [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3471.14s)]
*  violation of international law with seeming impunity. In this context, it is therefore [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3477.3s)]
*  important to continuously emphasize the party's obligations to strictly comply with international [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3483.7000000000003s)]
*  law. The Security Council should be the lead voice in this regard. Third and final, as we welcome the [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3491.54s)]
*  proposal for a ceasefire, the Council itself must continue to unequivocally demand a permanent [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3499.38s)]
*  ceasefire. Mr. President, in closing, Guyana stresses that this Council's responsibility [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3506.58s)]
*  for achieving a just end to this war is not eliminated by the adoption of this resolution. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3513.7s)]
*  This Council must continue to work assiduously to bring an end to the war and to ensure accountability [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3520.42s)]
*  for all the atrocities committed during its course. We must also redouble efforts to chart a path [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3527.22s)]
*  towards the swift implementation of the two-state solution. As ever, Guyana is committed to these [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3534.74s)]
*  goals. I thank you. I thank the representative of Guyana for their statement. I now give the [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3541.7799999999997s)]
*  floor to the representative of Ecuador. Thank you, President. Ecuador once again voted in favor of [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3548.5s)]
*  peace. We supported this draft resolution because we believe that the Council must ensure its voice [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3558.18s)]
*  is heard in support of a proposal in this sense and that can finally halt the war. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3565.54s)]
*  This proposal must be accepted by both parties and will put into effect an immediate and total [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3572.02s)]
*  ceasefire. It will allow for the release of the hostages and facilitate the alleviation of the [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3578.2599999999998s)]
*  terrible humanitarian situation facing civilians in Gaza. The implementation of all the phases of [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3585.06s)]
*  this proposal will also contemplate the beginning of a reconstruction plan in Gaza and rejects any [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3591.06s)]
*  attempts at demographic or territorial change in the Strip. President, this war began with the [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3597.06s)]
*  terrorist acts of attack of Hamas on the 7th of October and Ecuador will continue to condemn these [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3606.42s)]
*  attacks. It continues to cause much pain and suffering. For this reason, my country believes [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3613.46s)]
*  that the proposal on the 31st of May is an opportunity which must be seized to halt the [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3618.58s)]
*  spiral of violence. We must work now to ensure that this is the last war of this long conflict, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3624.9s)]
*  moving towards a peaceful, negotiated, definitive and just solution for the parties with the [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3633.94s)]
*  existence of two states, Palestine and Israel, upon the basis of the 1967 borders [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3639.46s)]
*  and the relevant resolutions. I thank you. I thank the representative of Ecuador for their [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3646.26s)]
*  statement. I now give the floor to the representative of Sierra Leone. Mr. President, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3652.18s)]
*  Sierra Leone would like to thank the United States for the initiative to work on this resolution. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3659.86s)]
*  We fully acknowledge and support ongoing diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Qatar, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3665.62s)]
*  Egypt and the United States aimed at achieving a deal that will bring about tangible results on [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3671.06s)]
*  the ground. It is in anticipation of this result that Sierra Leone voted in favor of the resolution [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3677.3799999999997s)]
*  just considered. As we have previously stated in this council, Sierra Leone shares a view that [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3684.3399999999997s)]
*  actions of the Security Council should complement ongoing diplomatic efforts that will bring about [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3690.8199999999997s)]
*  a meaningful pact for sustainable peace. While we do not agree to all the elements in the [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3696.66s)]
*  resolution, it is important that as the body responsible for the maintenance of international [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3702.2599999999998s)]
*  peace and security, we urge both Israel and Hamas to seize this opportunity to meaningfully engage [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3708.8999999999996s)]
*  and commit to an agreement that will lead to a ceasefire, the release of hostages and exchange [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3716.66s)]
*  of Palestinian prisoners, allow for the effective distribution of humanitarian assistance at scale [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3722.74s)]
*  throughout the Gaza Strip, the reconstruction of Gaza and actualization of the two-state solution. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3729.7s)]
*  The recent outcome of Israel's extensive raid in Ra'far on 8 June 2024 to release four hostages [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3736.8999999999996s)]
*  held by Hamas on 7 October 2023 is an indication that until a comprehensive deal is reached by both [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3745.06s)]
*  parties, such operations with devastating consequences for the civilian population [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3753.14s)]
*  will continue. To avoid future catastrophes and put an end to this brutal conflict, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3759.06s)]
*  Sierra Leone will raise the need for parties to the conflict to respect and implement all resolutions [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3765.14s)]
*  adopted by this council, the need for international law to be upheld and all ICJ orders complied with. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3770.58s)]
*  It is our sincere hope that parties to the conflict will approach the negotiating table [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3778.66s)]
*  with empathy, flexibility and careful consideration of the impact of this conflict [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3784.74s)]
*  on the women, children, the elderly and other vulnerable groups who since 7 October 2023 [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3791.46s)]
*  have been victims of their actions. Sierra Leone reiterates its unwavering commitment to this cause [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3798.98s)]
*  until a just and lasting solution is achieved. Thank you. I thank the representative of Sierra Leone [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3805.62s)]
*  for their statement. I now give the floor to the representative of Russian Federation. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3813.7s)]
*  President, the Russian Federation abstained on the draft Security Council Residence prepared by [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3821.14s)]
*  American Security Council colleagues in support of the proposal of mediators on a ceasefire in Gaza. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3828.1s)]
*  From the very outset of the military escalation in the Palestinian-Israel conflict, we have [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3838.18s)]
*  consistently and unwaveringly advocated for the imperative for a permanent ceasefire regime, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3844.18s)]
*  including in order to release hostages and remedy the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3852.02s)]
*  We have always welcomed any diplomatic efforts on the ground that are focused on reconciliation [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3859.38s)]
*  within parameters that suit both sides. At the same time, we have a whole host of questions about [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3866.58s)]
*  the American draft resolution, whereby the Security Council welcomes some deal, the ultimate [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3874.66s)]
*  outlines of which are not known to anyone, perhaps except the mediators. The information [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3881.62s)]
*  circulating in various open sources are very contradictory. The sponsors of the resolution [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3892.2599999999998s)]
*  did not keep the Security Council in the loop of the details of the agreement. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3898.8999999999996s)]
*  We essentially proposed to a cat in a bag. As such, there was no negotiation process. As such, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3907.06s)]
*  the sponsors brought a variation of a prepared text, de facto calling on members of the Security [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3915.7799999999997s)]
*  Council against the clock to sign up to it. Hamas is called upon to accept this so-called deal. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3923.06s)]
*  But still, there is no clarity regarding official agreement from Israel, as is written in the [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3931.46s)]
*  resolution for the deal proposed by President Biden, given the many statements from Israel [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3939.06s)]
*  on the extension of the war until Hamas is completely defeated. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3946.82s)]
*  So on what specifically has Israel agreed to? Perhaps we'll hear a response to that question [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3952.5s)]
*  today from the Israeli representative. We are convinced that the Security Council should not [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3959.6200000000003s)]
*  sign up to agreements with vague parameters and without guarantees not only of their implementation [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3965.54s)]
*  on the ground, but without the slightest clear understanding how the parties themselves and what [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3972.42s)]
*  their attitude is towards it. Essentially, the Council is giving a carte blanche and signing up [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3978.42s)]
*  to this plan with details that they don't have. The three parameters and phases, that's not details. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3984.34s)]
*  From the very beginning of the escalation in Gaza, the Council has adopted three resolutions [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3993.78s)]
*  which have remained on paper in terms of implementation. Here we can add a fourth. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=3999.3s)]
*  This is not something we could call a positive trend. The adoption of by the Council of a new [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4006.26s)]
*  document with a contain, the contents of which raises a mass of questions even without a clear [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4011.38s)]
*  demand to parties for an immediate and permanent ceasefire, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4017.3s)]
*  undermines its authority as the main body for maintenance of international peace and security. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4021.62s)]
*  We do not wish to block the resolution simply because it, as much as we understand, is supported [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4026.26s)]
*  by the Arab world. However, all of the questions that we have remain and require a response. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4031.0600000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4038.1800000000003s)]
*  I thank the representative of the Russian Federation for their statement. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4039.38s)]
*  I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Republic of Korea. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4045.7000000000003s)]
*  The Republic of Korea has repeatedly expressed its strong support for the diplomatic efforts by [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4051.38s)]
*  relevant countries, including the United States, Egypt and Qatar, to achieve an immediate ceasefire [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4058.82s)]
*  and release of hostages. The recent airstrikes on refugee camps and the massive operation to rescue [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4066.1s)]
*  hostages resulting in a large number of civilian casualties once again, have been the result of [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4073.7000000000003s)]
*  the imperative of finalizing the deal as soon as possible. More hesitation means more fatalities. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4079.54s)]
*  Today, the Republic of Korea voted in favor of the draft resolution proposed by the U.S. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4090.5800000000004s)]
*  with the sincere hope that it can urgently lead to positive impacts on the ground by pressing both [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4096.26s)]
*  parties, notably Hamas, to accept and implement the terms of the deal. It is also of crucial [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4102.66s)]
*  importance that Israel stays true to its word and remains steadfast to the accepted proposal. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4110.58s)]
*  No other considerations should be prioritized beyond the lives of innocent people, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4119.139999999999s)]
*  including Israeli hostages and Palestinian civilians in Gaza. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4123.94s)]
*  The Republic of Korea hopes that today's adoption of the resolution can lead to a concrete outcome [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4128.74s)]
*  on the ground, including a massive expansion of humanitarian aid. The human suffering due to this [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4133.86s)]
*  conflict is simply intolerable. As President Biden mentioned on May 31st, it is time for this war to [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4141.46s)]
*  end. I now resume my function as President of the Council. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4149.78s)]
*  I now give the floor to the Representative of Israel. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4160.099999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, Council, from the very first days following Hamas' invasion [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4164.66s)]
*  and brutal massacre on October 7th, Israel's goals have been very clear. To bring all our hostages [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4172.42s)]
*  back home and to dismantle Hamas' capabilities. Israel is committed to these goals, to free all [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4179.38s)]
*  the hostages, to destroy Hamas' military and governing capabilities, and to ensure that Gaza [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4186.66s)]
*  does not pose a threat to Israel in the future. And as we have echoed numerous times in this very [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4192.66s)]
*  chamber, once these goals are met, the war will end. If Hamas were to release the hostages and [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4198.82s)]
*  turn themselves in, not one more shot needs to be fired. Yet, sadly, for the past eight months, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4206.02s)]
*  Hamas has refused. 120 hostages are still being held by Hamas in appalling conditions. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4213.780000000001s)]
*  To this day, Hamas continues firing rockets at Israeli towns and cities and advancing their goal [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4221.38s)]
*  of murdering every Israeli. Members of the Council, it is Hamas that is preventing this war from [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4227.9400000000005s)]
*  ending. Hamas and Hamas alone. It is the genocidal jihadists who started this war and who choose to [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4235.06s)]
*  prolong it. Pressure must be applied upon Hamas and blame must be placed where it belongs, on Hamas [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4243.700000000001s)]
*  terrorists. This Council has adopted three resolutions calling for the release of hostages, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4251.46s)]
*  and each time Hamas is utterly ignored or request. Hamas does not care what the Council has to say [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4257.9400000000005s)]
*  because they have never been held responsible for their crimes by the Council. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4264.66s)]
*  The pressure on the terrorists should have begun long ago, but it's still not too late. It must [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4269.38s)]
*  begin now. Colleagues, Hamas's refusal to release the hostages through diplomacy has proven that the [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4274.34s)]
*  effort to bring our hostages home must also include military means. And this Saturday was [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4281.86s)]
*  the perfect example of how this can be achieved. As a result of a heroic operation, the IDF rescued [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4287.94s)]
*  four hostages from Gaza. These hostages, Noah Argamani, Almog Meirjan, Andrei Kuzlov, and Shlomi [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4295.62s)]
*  Ziv were being held in residential buildings by Palestinian families. While the hostages were [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4304.099999999999s)]
*  guarded by terrorists, Gazan civilians were their jailers. These so-called innocent civilians were [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4310.9s)]
*  not only cooperating with the terrorists, but were complicit in their heinous crimes. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4317.78s)]
*  As the world witnessed on Saturday, it is Israeli soldiers who sacrifice their lives to bring our [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4323.54s)]
*  hostages back home, while Hamas intentionally sacrifices Gazan children to prevent us from [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4329.219999999999s)]
*  rescuing hostages. Israel regrets any harm to civilians, but it must be emphasized that [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4335.38s)]
*  Palestinians who cooperate with Hamas and take part in their war crimes are not uninvolved. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4342.98s)]
*  This is the reality we face. The loss of life in Gaza is a tragedy, but if you don't put the blame [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4350.0199999999995s)]
*  on Hamas, you're advancing their strategy. Colleagues, Israel stands firm on our principles, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4356.98s)]
*  and they have not changed. We will continue until all of the hostages are returned, and until Hamas [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4363.78s)]
*  military and governing capabilities are dismantled. These have been our goals from day one. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4369.62s)]
*  Just as President Biden stated on May 31st, Hamas must not stay in power. Israel will not [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4376.099999999999s)]
*  let Hamas rearm or regroup so that Gaza can pose a threat to Israel. This is the unwavering goal [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4383.14s)]
*  that we are determined to achieve. This also means that Israel will not engage in meaningless and [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4390.5s)]
*  negotiations which can be exploited by Hamas as a means to stall for time. Mr. President, Hamas [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4397.46s)]
*  is solely responsible for this war. They invaded Israel, massacring innocents and taking hundreds [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4405.620000000001s)]
*  hostages. They continue to hold our loved ones in Gaza and continue targeting Israel. They use [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4413.54s)]
*  Gazans as human shields while furthering their genocidal goals. The time has come for this council [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4421.3s)]
*  to finally hold Hamas accountable, to finally place the blame where it belongs, to finally condemn [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4428.18s)]
*  terror. As the Security Council, it is your duty to apply relentless pressure on Hamas terrorists [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4434.74s)]
*  and ensure that all the hostages return home. Thank you, Mr. President. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4442.02s)]
*  I thank the representative of Israel for their statement. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4446.34s)]
*  There are no more names inscribed on the list of speakers. The meeting is adjourned. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4453.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DcdwPQ7Ao&t=4476.34s)]
