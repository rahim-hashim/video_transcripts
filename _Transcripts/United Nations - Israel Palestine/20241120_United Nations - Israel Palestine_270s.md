# Non-permanent members of the Security Council on Gaza - Joint Security Council Media Stakeout
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4)
*  Good morning, members of the media. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=0.0s)]
*  I am honored to make this statement on behalf of the 10 elected members of the Security [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=7.96s)]
*  Council, namely Algeria, Ecuador, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=12.92s)]
*  Slovenia, Switzerland, and my own country, Guyana. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=22.68s)]
*  Today, a resolution drafted by the E-10 member states was tabled for adoption by the Security [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=27.44s)]
*  Council to address the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=33.8s)]
*  The resolution was developed over a five-week period, during which the E-10 demonstrated [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=40.84s)]
*  great flexibility to reach consensus in the Council. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=48.44s)]
*  At the time that the decision was taken to develop this draft, four months had elapsed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=53.6s)]
*  since the passage of Resolution 2735. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  We had all supported 2735 with the expectation that a ceasefire deal would have been agreed [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=64.0s)]
*  and implemented swiftly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=71.72s)]
*  Therefore, in the context of a rapidly increasing death toll and widespread injury, destruction, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=73.92s)]
*  and forced displacement in the Gaza Strip, we the E-10 concluded that any new resolution [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=81.64s)]
*  by the Council should go further than the last four resolutions in relation to the conflict [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=94.56s)]
*  Importantly, our delegations acknowledged the insignificance of unequivocally demanding [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire, while also reiterating the demand [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=103.52s)]
*  for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=111.08s)]
*  We are therefore deeply disappointed that the text was not adopted. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=116.16s)]
*  Notwithstanding the non-adoption of the draft resolution that we put forward, the E-10 is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=121.64s)]
*  using this platform today to underscore three key messages. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=126.84s)]
*  First, the war in Gaza must end immediately, unconditionally, and permanently, and all [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=131.84s)]
*  remaining hostages must be immediately and unconditionally released. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=139.8s)]
*  Second, there must be full, rapid, safe, and unhindered entry of humanitarian assistance [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  at scale to and throughout the Gaza Strip so that Palestinian civilians can secure the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=153.44s)]
*  relief they urgently need. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=160.36s)]
*  In this regard, we also stress that UNRWA is the backbone of the humanitarian response [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=162.88s)]
*  in Gaza, and we call on all parties to enable the agency to carry out its vital mandate. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=169.48s)]
*  Third, the parties must abide by their obligations under international law, including international [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=177.0s)]
*  humanitarian law and international human rights law, particularly with regard to the protection [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=183.32s)]
*  of civilians and civilian infrastructure, the treatment of detainees, and the delivery [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=189.92s)]
*  of humanitarian aid. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=195.89999999999998s)]
*  Our collective efforts to end the hostilities will not stop. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=199.2s)]
*  Once more, the E-10 is underscoring to the international community, and more importantly, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=204.48s)]
*  to the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who continue to bear the cost of these hostilities, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=211.04s)]
*  as well as those still held hostage and their loved ones, that we are deeply conscious that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=218.2s)]
*  the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  We are deeply committed to this responsibility and will continue our best efforts to try [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  to facilitate council unity on this critical matter. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  Too many lives have already been lost. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  I thank you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=244.68s)]
*  Ambassador, Ambassador Xu Dezhi with China Central Television. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=246.64s)]
*  Now it's the fifth time that the U.S. vetoed the draft resolution calling for ceasefire. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=249.56s)]
*  What now? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=255.76s)]
*  What are we going to have in the Security Council? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=256.56s)]
*  What is the way out? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=259.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=261.32s)]
*  We will continue our efforts. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=261.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=263.32s)]
*  Do you think Israel is committing genocide in Gaza? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=264.32s)]
*  You can decide. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5bZg36PXB4&t=269.32s)]
