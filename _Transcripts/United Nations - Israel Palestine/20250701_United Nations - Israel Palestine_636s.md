Video Description: Briefing by Khaled Khiari, Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific, on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.
Assistant Secretary-General Khaled Khiari today (30 Jun) told the Security Council that “the level of suffering and brutality in Gaza is unbearable,” and “the continued collective punishment of the Palestinian people is unjustifiable.”
Khiari expressed deep concern at “Israeli military operations in Gaza that render large areas of Gaza uninhabitable,” and rejected “the forced displacement of the Palestinian population from any part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which would constitute a breach of international law obligations.”
He mourned the United Nations personnel killed in Gaza and “strongly” condemned “the killing of all health and humanitarian personnel and journalists.”
Khiari also condemned “the loss of lives and injuries of Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza” and called for “an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable.”
He stressed that the United Nations “will not participate in any aid delivery modality that does not comply with the fundamental humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence, and neutrality.”

*  Madam President, allow me to highlight some of the Secretariat General's observations regarding the implementation of Security Council Resolution 2334 during the port period. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=271.0s)]
*  The Secretariat General once again strongly condemns the horrific attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Israel on 7th of October, 2023, and their continued holding of hostages in horrific conditions. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=282.0s)]
*  Nothing can justify this act of terror. We remain appalled that hostages may be subjected to ongoing ill-treatment and that the bodies of hostages continue to be withheld. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=297.0s)]
*  The Secretariat General also unequivocally condemns the widespread killing and injury of civilians in Gaza, including children and women, and the destruction of homes, schools, hospitals, and mosques. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=310.0s)]
*  The level of suffering and brutality in Gaza is unbearable. The continued collective punishment of the Palestinian people is unjustifiable. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=323.0s)]
*  We remain deeply concerned by Israeli military operations in Gaza that render large areas of Gaza uninhabitable. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=332.0s)]
*  We reject the forced displacement of the Palestinian population from any part of the occupied Palestinian territory, which would constitute a breach of international law obligations. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=340.0s)]
*  We mourn the United Nations personnel killed in Gaza and strongly condemn the killing of all health and humanitarian personnel and journalists. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=351.0s)]
*  Following almost 80 days of Israeli denial of entry of all humanitarian and commercial supplies into Gaza, supplies have started to enter Gaza at wholly inadequate levels, which do not meet the massive needs of the population. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=360.0s)]
*  We call upon Israel to fulfill its obligation under international law and allow the rapid and unimpeded passages of humanitarian relief for civilians in need. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=374.0s)]
*  We strongly condemn the loss of lives and injuries of Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza, and we call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=386.0s)]
*  The United Nations will not participate in any aid delivery modality that does not comply with the fundamental humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence, and neutrality. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=399.0s)]
*  I echo once again the Secretary General's call for an immediate ceasefire and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages in Gaza. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=413.0s)]
*  Madam President, we remain deeply alarmed by relentless Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=423.0s)]
*  The ever-growing settlement footprint contributes to settler-related violence, further entrenches the Israeli occupation, hampers the free movement of the population, and undermines the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=432.0s)]
*  We are deeply concerned by Israeli government's decision to resume formal land registration in Area C and the serious risk that this will facilitate further settlement expansion and entrenchments. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=447.0s)]
*  The demolition and seizer of Palestinian oil structures, including internationally funded humanitarian projects, entail numerous violations of international law and raise concerns about the risk of forcible transfer. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=458.0s)]
*  The escalating violence in the occupied West Bank is alarming. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=473.0s)]
*  Military operations by Israeli security forces in the northern West Bank have resulted in high levels of fatalities, including women and children, significant population displacement and destruction of homes and infrastructure, particularly refugee camps. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=477.0s)]
*  We are concerned that the Palestinian Authority continues to face a deepening fiscal crisis that threatens to further undermine Palestinian institutions and basic service delivery. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=492.0s)]
*  Increased Israeli clearance revenues, deductions, and measures that introduce instability to the Palestinian financial sector should be urgently resolved. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=503.0s)]
*  The international community must provide immediate support to the Palestinian government to strengthen its governance capacity, address its fiscal challenges, and prepare it to reassume its responsibilities in Gaza. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=514.0s)]
*  This will require the establishment of political and security frameworks that can relieve the humanitarian catastrophe, start early recovery and reconstruction, address Israel's legitimate security concerns, and lay the groundwork for a political process to end the occupation and establish a viable two-state solution. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=526.0s)]
*  We welcome reform steps undertaken by the Palestinian Authority, including the appointment of a Vice President of Palestine, and encourage continued reforms urging international partners to support these efforts. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=546.0s)]
*  We regret the need to suspend the high-level international conference for the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution, and welcome the continued commitment of the co-chairs, France and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to convene the conference as soon as possible. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=560.0s)]
*  Madam President, allow me also a brief comment regarding the recent military escalation between Iran and Israel, which the Council has discussed in the past days. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=578.0s)]
*  I reiterate the Secretary General's condemnation of the tragic and unnecessary loss of lives and injuries to civilians and damages to homes and critical civilian infrastructure. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=590.0s)]
*  The Middle East region has been devastated by conflict and cannot withstand yet another major escalation. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=603.0s)]
*  We welcome the 24 June ceasefire agreement announced by President Trump and commend the efforts of the United States in coordination with Qatar to end the hostilities. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=610.0s)]
*  We hope that this ceasefire can be replicated in the other conflicts in the region. Nowhere is this more needed than in Gaza. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=623.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuslSimvhqg&t=631.0s)]
