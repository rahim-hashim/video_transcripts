Video Description: Hybrid press briefing by Andrea De Domenico, Head of OCHA's Office in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  He briefed reporters virtually on the situation in Gaza.

The Head of OCHA's Office in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) Andrea De Domenico, today (03 Jun) told reporters in New York that “the idea of extending this war for another six months or seven months is simply terrible.”

Briefing via video teleconference from Jerusalem upon his return from Gaza, Domenico said in Rafah “the narrowing space that is left for civilians to conglomerate and leave is becoming more and more limited and more and more crowded.”

Within the tent, in the camps, he said, it is “so hot during the day, and of course there is lack of water for people within the tents. And so, people basically are going to the sea to find some opportunity to cool themselves down because of the high temperature of the day.”

He said, “by doing this also they take the opportunity to wash themselves, because there is no other way that people can obtain some decent hygiene.”

Commenting on the erosion of civility within Gaza, Domenico said “the rule of the strongest is becoming the only rule that is prevailing simply because there is so little for people to survive that only the strongest can have access to that, and that has eroded and penetrated even the relations within family members.”

The humanitarian official estimated “more or less there are 20,000 pregnant women that will again lose any point of reference for bringing their pregnancy to an end in conditions that are suitable for, and adequate for a proper delivery for their babies.”

He said OCHA “will keep on trying and doing our job day in and day out, to the end of our ability. And the concern for me is how people will cope with this.”

A staggering one million people have now fled Rafah in southern Gaza, the UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on Monday, amid fresh reports of overnight attacks in southern, central and northern locations by Israeli forces.

*  Great. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  And now we have you up on screen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  So that's working perfectly. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=8.44s)]
*  So good morning, everyone. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=12.8s)]

*  where he had just been. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=26.88s)]
*  Andrea, over to you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=28.92s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=32.52s)]
*  And thank you for inviting me again to brief you and finding the time to hear this briefing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=33.88s)]
*  I just came out from three weeks in Gaza. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  I came out on Friday and I thought it was important to give a little bit the sense of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  what I've seen, what I've witnessed and seen with my eyes and breath and smell with my [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=52.64s)]
*  nose and give you a little bit of sense of the situation at the moment. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=59.16s)]
*  Normally, you know, we have a lot of data that we can share, but those you can find. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=67.24s)]
*  So what I thought today to start with is to give you a little bit of, you know, five images [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=73.28s)]
*  that have kind of remained in my mind after these three weeks that speaks about some [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=79.56s)]
*  elements of what we are witnessing and dealing with as a humanitarian community in the Gaza [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=88.08s)]
*  Strip in these days. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  First of all, I think that the events that have unfolded in Raqqa since the 7th of May, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=97.76s)]
*  with the subsequent move of up to almost a million people that found refuge for months [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=105.76s)]
*  in Raqqa and now that they've moved all of a sudden, despite the fact that some areas [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=113.44s)]
*  of Raqqa in fact has no evacuation order or, you know, some contested this expression because [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=120.92s)]
*  it's the way that the Israeli use, but in fact is forcible transfer of people. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=128.48s)]
*  The result of it is that the narrowing space that is left for civilians to conglomerate [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=134.92s)]
*  and leave is becoming the more and more limited and the more and more crowded. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=145.88s)]
*  It's impossible as of today to move from Mawasi where some of our premises are to go to Khayounis [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=157.8s)]
*  or Derbala without literally navigating through a wave of people that are everywhere. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  A movement that normally would take 10 minutes, 15 minutes maximum is taking simply one hour [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=175.12s)]
*  because people are everywhere. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=181.68s)]
*  What we have witnessed particularly in the last two weeks is the more and more movement [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=184.76s)]
*  of people going north. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=189.08s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=191.08s)]
*  From... [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  Those who are online, thank you. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  The more and more you can cross, you know, people leaving with whatever they can gather, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  putting in donkey carts and piling them up at an unbelievable height and these images [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  of people with very little things that are moving their entire life to a safer place [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=214.24s)]
*  if there is anything safe. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  The days of... [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  Some days, you know, the good season is coming, the temperature has increased and one day [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=229.84s)]
*  I was driving along the coastal road and I noticed that all of a sudden an enormous amount [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=235.28s)]
*  of people were on the shore and actually on the sea. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=241.04s)]
*  And then I was, you know, I stopped there and I start asking, you know, if there was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=245.04s)]
*  anything special and what I've been told is that the living condition within the tent [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=249.84s)]
*  is so hot during the day and of course there is lack of water for people within the tent. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=254.56s)]
*  And so people basically are going to the sea to find some opportunity to cool themselves [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=265.24s)]
*  down because of the high temperature of the day and by doing this also they take the opportunity [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=270.84s)]
*  to wash themselves because there is no other ways that people can maintain some decent hygiene. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=276.56s)]
*  This intensity of living condition is progressively eroding the social fabric of the community [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=282.56s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=299.28s)]
*  For those who have frequented Gaza, you know, Gazawi are very welcoming people, they are [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=300.56s)]
*  formidable guests when you go to see them, they always will put something on the table, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=307.96s)]
*  even the poorest families will figure out a way to welcome you in some way. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=312.56s)]
*  And the social bonding of the families and the extended families is fundamental in the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=320.36s)]
*  society. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=326.8s)]
*  What we are witnessing more and more is that this fabric is progressively being destroyed [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=328.0s)]
*  where the rule of the strongest is becoming the only rule that is prevailing simply because [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=333.32s)]
*  there is so little for people to survive that only the strongest can have access to that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=342.64s)]
*  and that has eroded and penetrated even the relations within family members. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=349.64s)]
*  I've met with some people and they were telling me how there was a dispute between brothers [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=356.64s)]
*  around a can of chickpeas and because of that kind of chickpeas two brothers and their families [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=364.2s)]
*  were not speaking anymore to each other and losing that network of mutual solidarity and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=371.56s)]
*  support that is essential in a situation of this despair like this simply because not [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=377.76s)]
*  even that the family is able to go beyond this depriving situation that everybody is [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  confronted to day in day out. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  The living conditions of everybody including the people around ourselves is further compounded [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  by the lack of basic commodities and access to simple tools and tools that are available [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=404.44s)]
*  and equipment and materials that will allow for example families to cook their meal. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=414.56s)]
*  So something that stayed in my mind in these days was that during when you approach the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=420.56s)]
*  time for dinner most probably the only meal of the day for many the order that you can [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=425.92s)]
*  smell all around the tent and the makeshift tents that are all around our places is very [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=433.64s)]
*  very acre and strong because people burn whatever they can find and mostly they can find basically [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=441.32s)]
*  plastic and garbage that they can use to warm up their dinner. There is no electricity as [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=449.2s)]
*  you know there is no cooking gas or there is very scarce cooking gas and even when it [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=457.52s)]
*  is available people do not have the means to access the cooking gas and buy the cooking [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=462.91999999999996s)]
*  gas and so people used to burn and you see all day long children and women are going [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=470.64s)]
*  around all day long collecting garbage and paper and plastic whatever they can find to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  be able then in the evening to cook their dinner. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=491.4s)]
*  And the last image that stayed and is quite shocking and strong in my mind is as you know [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=495.96s)]
*  on the 26th of May one site within the safe zone has been hit by an airstrike who has [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=503.08s)]
*  ignited a big fire in a tented area in proximity of the Unralog base which of course has not [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=514.6s)]
*  only killed the people on the spot but also then the consequences of the fire have killed [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  a considerable amount of people. The services that the ambulances that went there brought [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=530.16s)]
*  the wounded and the bodies of the victims to the hospitals that are concentrated along [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=539.0s)]
*  the Mawasi area field hospitals and I was talking with the director of one of these [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=547.0s)]
*  field hospitals he is a guy that is navigated in humanitarian work that has been doing many [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=552.0s)]
*  missions in war zones he himself comes from a country where he grew up amongst war and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=558.28s)]
*  he was telling me in describing this scene that he had to deal with almost with tears [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=566.04s)]
*  in his eyes among the people that they have collected there were men probably around in [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=571.92s)]
*  his 40s 50s who was still hugging his daughter the small corpse of his daughter and they [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=578.4799999999999s)]
*  were both burned and carbonized by the fire and they tried to separate the two bodies [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=587.76s)]
*  but they couldn't because they were so entangled and so the only way to do that was to break [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=595.76s)]
*  in the bones and they refused to do so and they said they decided to leave them together [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=604.84s)]
*  in this final and eternal hug that was the for me the image of the collective trauma [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=612.24s)]
*  and the images of the violence that will mark people forever and I do not understand how [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=620.24s)]
*  children will recover from this you know unimaginable and difficult to describe a situation of constant [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=627.72s)]
*  trauma that they have to go through. Situation of course of you follow I think our reports [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=637.76s)]
*  fatalities have reached almost 36,000 people there has been a lot of discussions about [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=644.76s)]
*  the number of fatalities and I think that we have clarified that the numbers that we [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=653.96s)]
*  are reporting are reported by MOH recently we had a clarification from MOH that could [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=660.96s)]
*  identify out of those fatalities a certain number of people but the overall number of [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=667.96s)]
*  fatalities remain at 30 almost 36,000 people have been killed. We have reached unfortunately [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=674.96s)]
*  almost 80,000 wounded the situation of the LCRO is very difficult to identify and I think [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=686.96s)]
*  that the systems have been described over and over again by WHO colleagues and you know [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=697.96s)]
*  the fact that we have to count on field hospitals which are not you know fully operational hospitals [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=704.2s)]
*  they are field hospitals so they are intense and with the limitations of what this entails [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=712.36s)]
*  it means that these people can only be treated in you know suboptimal conditions despite [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=721.36s)]
*  the you know never ending efforts of these the teams the medical teams that have been [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=727.04s)]
*  deployed from all over the world are doing it is still very very heartbreaking to see [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=731.48s)]
*  the condition upon which these people the injured people can find a place where to be [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=738.8s)]
*  treated. There are gigantic efforts done by WHO also to re-establish or maintain services [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=746.2s)]
*  in the hospital in the middle area and in high units area but as far as Rafa is concerned [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=754.2s)]
*  there are no more functioning hospitals properly said it's only field hospitals. The displacement [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=761.2s)]
*  as I said is continuing to move toward the middle area in an area where now there was [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=768.2s)]
*  already there were already a lot of people now we have added another million people more [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  or less 950,000 that have left Rafa and you know one thing that people discussing in these [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=782.0s)]
*  days was telling me is that it took them months to get used to the new life in Rafa finding [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=791.28s)]
*  understanding where they were finding the right place to look for services to look for [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=799.2s)]
*  food to look for water and find some sort of you know decent life in the hospital. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=804.72s)]
*  Despite all the challenges and the dire conditions and now that they have to be displaced once [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=812.32s)]
*  again they have to relearn all this they have to refine their footprint and understand how [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=818.2s)]
*  they will deal with the simplest necessities of every day. Out of this almost one million [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=825.2s)]
*  people displaced colleagues from UNFPA were reminding us you know we estimate more or [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=833.2s)]
*  less there are 20,000 pregnant women that will again lose any point of reference for [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=839.8s)]
*  bringing their pregnancy to an end in conditions that are suitable for and adequate for a proper [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=846.7199999999999s)]
*  delivery for their babies. And so again this you know this nightmare of finding the where [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=855.3599999999999s)]
*  will this new life come into life how which conditions where this will be done. Shelter [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=863.36s)]
*  is of course particularly challenges as you know we have had gigantic challenges to bring [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=872.52s)]
*  in the tents and the torpoline and all the material that is needed to set up new tents [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=879.28s)]
*  because you know there is not much sites left intact. Moving out from Rafa we have calculated [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=887.28s)]
*  that 36 sites of UNRWA that were hosting IDPs have been lost those were mainly schools that [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=897.64s)]
*  were turned into IDP centers and those people will not have with them any material so it [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=904.52s)]
*  means that at least for those 35 centers 36 centers people will go out without anything [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=911.12s)]
*  in their hands and they will be in the necessity to find a tent or plastic sheeting and some [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=916.72s)]
*  pieces of wood to make their new shelter. And of course with all the risk that as you [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=923.28s)]
*  know unfortunately with the bombardment of the tented area with the risk associated of [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=928.84s)]
*  living in flammable material that of course one hit has created that terrible fire. The [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=936.84s)]
*  amount of solid waste that is stream related everywhere along the street is impressive. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  We have not been able to access landfills because landfills are normally decentralized [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=958.32s)]
*  compared to the populated areas which means that they are basically in the margins along [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=964.92s)]
*  the fence and so toward Israel or Egypt and those areas are absolutely not accessible [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=971.16s)]
*  and we have been you know despite multiple requests to have access to those areas the [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=978.52s)]
*  access has been denied and so in the meantime we are looking desperate for alternative sites. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=984.28s)]
*  Some have been identified of course they are in proximity of people and let me imagine [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=991.08s)]
*  what it means with you know 35 degrees in daylight if not more with this you know mountains [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=995.24s)]
*  of solid waste concentrated there. Education is as you know since the 7th, 6th of October, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1003.72s)]
*  7th of October has been suspended and for me one of the discussions that I have had [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1013.2s)]
*  with colleagues on the ground that are trying to work with children and find solutions to [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1021.08s)]
*  at least if not offering a formal education at least offering an informal education but [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1026.48s)]
*  you know recreational material is still considered today non humanitarian assistance and has [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1034.08s)]
*  never been allowed in by the government of Israel into Gaza. So we have a mass of more [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1041.84s)]
*  than 600,000 students that did not access education since now 8 months and have no activities [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1049.84s)]
*  other than those improvised by the local NGO that are very creatively trying to find some [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1057.8s)]
*  time and space and create some activities for those children but the reality is that [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1065.84s)]
*  there is very little that we can offer and hence you know just the exposure to this violence [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1072.36s)]
*  and these very harsh living conditions that I'm sure will mark this generational children [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1077.44s)]
*  for the long term which you know nobody knows what will be the long term impact on these [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1084.44s)]
*  children. The operational environment remains extremely challenging you know at times I [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1093.8s)]
*  wonder if the humanitarian operation in Gaza are crippled by design you know we are trying [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1100.8s)]
*  to save lives every day but the reality is that you know our hands have been tied on [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1114.52s)]
*  our back since the very beginning and despite all our engagement with the parties trying [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1122.68s)]
*  to gain more space we didn't have that chance to solve some of these issues. Some have moved [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1128.32s)]
*  and then some conversation brought some results but the bulk of those remains unchanged. You [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1136.28s)]
*  know we were used to say months back you know that someone has broken our legs and now all [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1142.52s)]
*  of a sudden they're asking us to run. I think we have learned to run with crutches if you [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1149.6s)]
*  want and now they have taken away the crutches also because that's our daily struggle to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1155.4s)]
*  solve issues and challenges that have practical solutions but somehow they are never fully [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1161.5600000000002s)]
*  addressed and when we address one element there is yet another bottleneck yet another [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1167.3200000000002s)]
*  challenge that we are dealing with. We stop you know doing the tit for tat with the Israeli [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1171.72s)]
*  on these things but reality is that there are some basic support that we have been asking [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1179.72s)]
*  over and over again that has never been granted to us and those same equipment or material [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1186.84s)]
*  are the basic upon which any expansion of a humanitarian operation should be based upon. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1196.0s)]
*  The amount of amazing work that colleagues in Gaza are doing despite all these challenges [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1204.0s)]
*  is simply beyond remarkable. It's very dangerous at times in our operations. There are long [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1211.48s)]
*  days 14 hours a day of work day in day out there is no weekend of course and despite [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1221.56s)]
*  all this we are still accused of not being able to keep up the pace when the parties [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1229.56s)]
*  know exactly why this is happening and why we are not able to do everything we should [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1237.84s)]
*  be able to do. Also the effort of local and international NGOs is commendable considering [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1243.28s)]
*  all the challenges and the obstacles we have. Just to give you an example in order to bring [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1250.28s)]
*  in new and fresh medical teams in particular but in general humanitarian aid workers we [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1258.52s)]
*  had to organize convoys that bring them through Keren Shalom. We had to organize a group of [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1269.84s)]
*  people that were in the hospital. The only way out to do this in safety is with the armored [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1280.44s)]
*  vehicle that only the UN possess and only international drivers can do this type of [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1287.48s)]
*  operation. The other week we tried to do one of these operations. We have been delayed [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1294.52s)]
*  for hours and hours and hours to get the green light to reach the crossing and collect the [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1299.52s)]
*  green light. After hours of waiting we have been told at 7 o'clock in the evening that [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1306.52s)]
*  it was no longer possible to cross outside and go into Israel. So we had to abort the [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1313.52s)]
*  operations and that took 7 vehicles of the United Nations with 7 international drivers [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1321.16s)]
*  4 of which were head of agencies. An entire day we have been out for 13 hours just to [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1328.2s)]
*  do that one single movement and abort it at the very last moment. This is one of the many [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1335.72s)]
*  obstacles we have not to mention the fact that even to reach that place we have to go [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1343.8s)]
*  through what is considered to be a safe road and notwithstanding that we have been caught [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1347.8400000000001s)]
*  in crossfire repeatedly. It's very challenging the coordination with the partners. We have [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1353.0800000000002s)]
*  been trying to engage with them and we have tried to propose solutions that are concrete [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1365.2s)]
*  and actionable. There is still quite a journey to walk and I really believe and hope that [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1375.32s)]
*  we will be able in the coming weeks to entangle some of this aspect. One of the challenges [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1383.2s)]
*  of course once we bring inside assistance then is to make sure that the assistance reaches [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1391.2s)]
*  the most vulnerable people because everybody has been obsessed about counting trucks since [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1397.88s)]
*  the very beginning including most of you. The problem is that this is not the end of [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1404.2s)]
*  humanitarian aid actually it is the beginning because the journey starts from when the commodities [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1411.3600000000001s)]
*  are delivered in Gaza, inside Gaza just across the border. The challenge then is to bring [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1417.6s)]
*  it into the women, the children, the elderly, the people with disability that needs that [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1424.6799999999998s)]
*  support because nobody else is taking care of them otherwise. And that is still very [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1432.24s)]
*  challenging both in terms of the security, safety, logistical aspect of getting there [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1436.9199999999998s)]
*  but also unfortunately once again we are living through the breakdown of law and order and [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1442.84s)]
*  two days ago we had the worst of our experiences in bringing in commodities where almost 70 [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1449.92s)]
*  percent of the convoy that we were able to put together for that day did not reach the [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1457.56s)]
*  final destination because it was intercepted by mostly I think by criminals but also by [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1462.92s)]
*  desperate people that were simply beyond any ability to wait and see assistance coming. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1470.92s)]
*  It is really challenging for us to do all these operations without equipment. We have [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1487.88s)]
*  been asking over and over again for communications, armor vehicles, the maintenance of the vehicles [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1495.7600000000002s)]
*  that we are having inside Gaza. There is not a single vehicle that is not bringing the [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1501.5600000000002s)]
*  marks of the volatile, unsafe, dangerous environment that we are working in and protective equipment [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1507.2s)]
*  for the personnel and so on and so forth. And still when we try to bring in even the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1516.2800000000002s)]
*  most simple of the equipment, a router, just to make sure that we can communicate with [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1523.08s)]
*  the teams and we can coordinate the response of the humanitarian community, we fail to [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1529.32s)]
*  do it so because the coordination was not granted. I really commend the work of all [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1535.32s)]
*  the colleagues that are there, all the United Nations together are trying to mutualize our [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1545.44s)]
*  resources, assets and personnel to keep afloat of these operations and this response. But [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1552.64s)]
*  the challenges are at times overwhelming and I am amazed to see that every morning at 6 [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1561.96s)]
*  o'clock the teams wake up and restart to engage in another day trying to bring assistance [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1569.0s)]
*  to people. It is simply beyond my ability to express in words the thankfulness that [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1576.92s)]
*  I have for the bravery and the determination of our colleagues and the resilience of the [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1584.48s)]
*  civilians that are trying to find a way to survive this war. I stop here and I am happy [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1592.24s)]
*  to respond to your questions. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1599.24s)]
*  Andrea thank you very much on behalf of the United Nations Correspondence Association [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1612.96s)]
*  for doing this briefing. My name is Edith Lederath from the Associated Press. A few [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1619.96s)]
*  quick follow-ups and then a question. Where are you now doing this briefing from? You [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1626.96s)]
*  said that about 950,000 Palestinians have left RAFA. Does that mean that there are still [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1636.6s)]
*  about 500,000 or maybe more than that left in RAFA itself? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1648.44s)]
*  And on this looting incident two days ago, can you give us some more details on where [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1657.76s)]
*  that convoy was coming from and where it was going? And my question is actually what if [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1668.0s)]
*  any food, water and medicine are getting into Gaza? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1679.64s)]
*  And do you see the prospects or famine actually setting in because you were there for three [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1687.08s)]
*  weeks? Thank you. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1696.76s)]
*  Am I answering one by one? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1701.76s)]
*  Yes please. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1706.76s)]
*  Okay. So I'm in Jerusalem, in my office in Jerusalem. I came back Friday and I'm here [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1707.76s)]
*  in Jerusalem today. In RAFA we have roughly 1.4 million people but that includes the governorates. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1714.76s)]
*  So RAFA city as of today, considering that Tal Azzurra town is the most westward neighborhood [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1724.16s)]
*  of RAFA and I was driving through it on Friday morning and it is quite desertic, it's a ghost [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1732.32s)]
*  area by now. We estimate that maybe in town, there might be up to 100,000 people and then [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1739.32s)]
*  you have some people remaining in the, including the people that are remaining in the coastal [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1752.08s)]
*  area which is farther west from the built up area. And so this, the entire population [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1758.56s)]
*  then has moved as I said to Orochani Unis and in their balab. The convoy was a convoy [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1765.56s)]
*  that was organized by joint efforts between WFP and URA. It was a pick up of commodities [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1774.6399999999999s)]
*  from the Karim Shalom, so Karim of Jerusalem, so the Gaza side of Karim Shalom. That is [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1783.36s)]
*  as you might know, thanks to the Egyptians reopening of the commodities access, humanitarian [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1791.36s)]
*  commodities only for the UN and NGOs, now we had a considerable amount of trucks that [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1801.8799999999999s)]
*  were allowed in and the Israeli facilitated the drop off in the yard and that's the communication [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1808.36s)]
*  that the Israeli keep on doing that we are slowing picking them up. But the condition [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1816.36s)]
*  to go to pick up these commodities of course are very challenging. As I said, the road, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1823.04s)]
*  the new road that has been built by the Israeli is a road that passes north of the airport. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1828.4799999999998s)]
*  They have progressively expanded the road to make it a bit more easier for us to go [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1836.6399999999999s)]
*  through it. But then when it enters into neighborhood in proximity of Salah ad-Din, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1840.68s)]
*  this is still an area of battles. So that's where we have had a lot of problems. And from [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1847.68s)]
*  there on the convoy is taken to the north along Salah ad-Din road and basically they [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1854.3600000000001s)]
*  could go either directly to Rafa from there or going a bit north and Han Yunis and their [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1861.2s)]
*  bala. And in that area, the first stretch of Salah ad-Din road, the vast majority of [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1866.72s)]
*  the trucks were stopped by individuals and they were completely looted. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1874.16s)]
*  What is I think important to understand is that that effort of ours is not only to support [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1884.2s)]
*  the backbone of the operation with the WFP and UNRWA and WHO and UNFPA, so all the agencies [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1892.2s)]
*  that have been very active and UNICEF that have been very active in the response, but [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1901.04s)]
*  also our NGO partners. And some of our NGO partners lost the entire consignment for even [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1906.28s)]
*  a month, up to a month of their operations. So it is utterly disappointing to see that [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1914.04s)]
*  today there was a communication signed by the community leaders from Gaza, they were [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1921.4s)]
*  very using very strong words, condemning those attacks, which is positive. I think that is [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1927.6000000000001s)]
*  important where the community pushing for avoid those events to repeat itself. But it [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1933.68s)]
*  gives you just the sense of the number of challenges that we have in sight and the reality [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1941.92s)]
*  they were facing on the ground. With the famine question, first of all, the colleagues that [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1948.04s)]
*  are looking into the data and the IPC, the new data set on the IPC is still under collection [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1957.24s)]
*  and verification. You might remember before the 7th of May, when the RAFA operation started, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1965.52s)]
*  there was a moment where, it was a few weeks actually, where the Israeli had really pushed [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1972.0s)]
*  for an increase of not only humanitarian aid, and actually was more private sector and commercial [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1978.24s)]
*  activities than humanitarian aid, which was overall positive because it allows the market [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1985.4s)]
*  to receive a series of product. The limitation of that are twofold. First of all, they do [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1991.24s)]
*  not go everywhere in Gaza because still reaching the north is a bit complicated, so only a [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=1998.32s)]
*  little portion of those goods that we've seen appearing in the market in the south that [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2004.28s)]
*  ever appeared in the north. And then there is an issue of the diversification of these [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2009.36s)]
*  products. Some of these products are for sure to the benefit of the population, but they [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2016.52s)]
*  are not addressing the most urgent needs in the way we see them, and they are not providing [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2022.84s)]
*  the variety and diversification of food and nutrition that will allow to tackle famine. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2028.28s)]
*  And then there is a fundamental issue of affordability. So a vast part of the population, civilian [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2040.6s)]
*  population in Gaza simply cannot afford to buy those items. So while we see in the markets [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2048.6s)]
*  at least vegetables and fruits have appeared, and some other, there are eggs, we saw some [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2057.4s)]
*  of these products coming into the market, which is absolutely essential, but still we [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2064.7999999999997s)]
*  have a problem of making sure that those can be to the benefit of the most vulnerable population [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2071.52s)]
*  and that's why I was talking about a little bit the law of the strongest because my sense [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2077.84s)]
*  is that the most vulnerable people still need to be assisted and supported by our efforts. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2082.92s)]
*  I cannot speak about is this getting closer or maintaining a sort of status quo on the [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2090.12s)]
*  looming threat of famine. For this we have to defer to the colleagues that are doing [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2101.0s)]
*  the IPC study and they will tell us. For sure though in the north the situation is a bit [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2106.32s)]
*  more complex. I think that the opening of Zikim in the north has made a positive, a [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2114.76s)]
*  very positive impact in the north, while we are still 300, 350,000 people, and there is [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2122.48s)]
*  a steady entry of some commodities. There there is an issue more about diversification [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2130.48s)]
*  of those commodities and I think this is something that the colleagues of WFP, UNRWA and the [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2136.6s)]
*  humanitarian community all together are trying to work out to make sure that we can also [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2142.2400000000002s)]
*  change the current situation there. Over. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2147.28s)]
*  Michelle? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2151.2s)]
*  Thanks Andrea. Michelle Nichols from Reuters. We have seen some photos of starving children [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2154.4s)]
*  and children who have died from malnutrition and what not. What did you see while you were [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2162.2400000000002s)]
*  there in terms of malnutrition and how widespread was that? Then under this new sort of deal [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2167.96s)]
*  that is being, that President Biden spoke about on Friday, there would be 600 trucks [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2177.2400000000002s)]
*  daily coming in. Is that enough? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2183.68s)]
*  So in terms of sign of malnutrition, it is a bit more complex than the, famine as expert [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2190.2s)]
*  of UNICEF or WFP will tell you, is a combination effect of food, nutrition, health and water [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2197.8799999999997s)]
*  and sanitation. Is the combined effect of these elements all together that results in [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2205.88s)]
*  malnutrition. So yes, there are cases of malnourished children that have been reported, documented [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2216.88s)]
*  and identified, particularly in the north and to a lesser extent in the south. But we [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2222.52s)]
*  cannot be distracted only by, it is not that individual malnutrition, they have it, just [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2230.52s)]
*  is the measurement of the MUAC is not sufficient. It is the combination of those elements. The [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2237.92s)]
*  IPC colleagues are working on this and they will for sure come out with an updated set [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2247.04s)]
*  of information that will give more clarity on where we are in terms of these elements. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2255.04s)]
*  The last time that we've done this, there were 30%, a bit more of children under the [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2264.44s)]
*  age of two in the north of Gaza that suffer from acute malnutrition and 10% of children [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2271.44s)]
*  under the age of two in Rafa. This was the starting point when we last measured that. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2278.64s)]
*  So hopefully in the coming weeks we'll have more information about that. On the 600 tracks [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2284.84s)]
*  and on the current negotiations, first of all, the United Nations has not been yet fully [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2290.32s)]
*  involved in this discussion, so I don't really have more than what has been told to media [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2296.0s)]
*  about that. And as I said in previous intervention with you, it is not, counting tracks is not [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2303.64s)]
*  the right metrics because it is about also the quality of what we receive. To give you [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2314.12s)]
*  an example, I was discussing with partners that are dealing with people with disabilities [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2321.12s)]
*  and they have identified a series of adult and children that need some supportive devices. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2325.92s)]
*  So, assistive devices, sorry. Those assistive devices are simply not available in the market. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2333.0s)]
*  So unless we prioritize the right things for this type of particularly vulnerable population, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2342.08s)]
*  we will not be able to alleviate their suffering, their conditions. So it cannot only be about [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2351.04s)]
*  how many tracks. Another example that is clear is you can have a track with mattresses and [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2358.56s)]
*  then you will probably deliver mattresses to 100 people. But you can have a track with [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2366.44s)]
*  fuel that is given fuel for the desalination plant that is given drinking water for half [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2371.4s)]
*  a million people for a day. So it's different ways to measure and I think we have to make [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2377.72s)]
*  sure that the United Nations and the humanitarian community can contribute to the prioritization [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2385.3199999999997s)]
*  of how these commodities are prioritized to enter Gaza in order to address the most urgent [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2391.8399999999997s)]
*  needs of people. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2399.8399999999997s)]
*  Gabriel? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2402.4399999999996s)]
*  Hi, Andrea. Thank you very much for the briefing. Gabriel Elizondo from Al Jazeera English. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2403.8399999999997s)]
*  Just two questions. One is thank you very much for the briefing. Some Israeli officials [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2411.52s)]
*  have said in recent days that they expect that this war could go on until the end of [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2418.08s)]
*  the year. My question to you is from a humanitarian standpoint, what would be the impacts of that [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2426.84s)]
*  if that is indeed true? And my second question is more of a hypothetical, which I normally [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2434.4s)]
*  don't like to ask, but if there was to be a full ceasefire tomorrow and all of the border [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2441.1200000000003s)]
*  crossings were to be fully open, it seems like the situation in Gaza is so dire that [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2449.32s)]
*  it would take, I should ask you, what would it take after a ceasefire and the borders [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2455.2400000000002s)]
*  are open, the border crossings are open to get in the amount of aid and reestablish [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2461.82s)]
*  some semblance of what is needed there? Thank you. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2466.54s)]
*  So the perspective of having a war until the end of the year is simply terrifying in my [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2474.54s)]
*  mind. I was reflecting a little bit on all this dynamic of the criticism moved to the [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2481.7000000000003s)]
*  United Nations, the inability to deliver, the inability of the humanitarian community [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2488.7s)]
*  to deliver. And I've lived on my skin in the last three weeks how complicated it is to [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2495.7s)]
*  operate. And honestly, I think there is no other place in the world where the system [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2507.54s)]
*  has been put to such a level of challenges and threats. Honestly, I believe that there [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2513.74s)]
*  is no other place where the UN would still be present in the current conditions that [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2525.8599999999997s)]
*  we're living in Gaza if it was not for the fact that Gaza is the only place where people [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2533.74s)]
*  cannot flee. And so the Secretary General made a very clear commitment that the UN will [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2541.02s)]
*  stay and deliver in order to alleviate the suffering of people in Gaza. And it takes [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2548.2599999999998s)]
*  what it takes. So for me, the idea of extending this war for another six months or seven months [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2556.7s)]
*  is simply terrible. But we will stay and deliver. We will keep on trying and doing our job day [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2564.7s)]
*  in, day out to the end of our ability. And the concern for me is how people will cope [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2575.8999999999996s)]
*  with this. Because I cannot, you know, what we've witnessed in the last two weeks, the [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2585.54s)]
*  growing tension within communities. The law of the strongest that I was describing earlier [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2594.7s)]
*  is accompanied with increasing family disputes, increasing fighting between Palestinians, families, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2601.22s)]
*  and violence. And not only, you know, across families, but at times within families. And [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2608.5s)]
*  I wonder where is the breaking point where it will become, you know, completely impossible [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2615.98s)]
*  for us to operate properly and within all these challenges. So it is really a question [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2621.68s)]
*  that, you know, the international community should ask itself, where is the limit acceptable [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2631.48s)]
*  in this situation? If in an ideal scenario tomorrow we have a ceasefire, I think that [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2638.48s)]
*  the first and most important element of it is that people will stop, you know, civilians [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2645.68s)]
*  will stop being victims of bombardments and the killing of civilians will stop. The feeling [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2651.0s)]
*  of complete uncertainty that we have confronted every day going into Tala Sultan, Tala Sultan [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2662.26s)]
*  is the neighborhood in Rafa where our offices were based. Every day we were going there, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2673.32s)]
*  people were asking us, are you coming back tomorrow? Because they saw us as the parameters [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2680.14s)]
*  of how dangerous it was to stay there. And when they realized that we were no longer [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2686.3799999999997s)]
*  going there because the Israelis have asked us to coordinate our movements and they have [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2691.54s)]
*  not allowed us then to go in there because of the security conditions prevailing in the [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2696.42s)]
*  area, people realized all of a sudden that there was a problem coming through and most [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2701.7799999999997s)]
*  probably the fighting was coming down. So I think that in an ideal scenario of a ceasefire, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2707.7s)]
*  that will be a gigantic relief for people. And then I think is the combination of private [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2713.3399999999997s)]
*  sector and humanitarian assistance combined together that will be able to start progressively [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2719.66s)]
*  resuming and bringing people's lives to dignity and to some sort of normalcy. It won't be [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2725.7999999999997s)]
*  easy. It will be a very long and very complicated journey. There are some areas of Gaza that [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2733.6800000000003s)]
*  are no more. They simply do not exist anymore. They are just rubbles and total destruction. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2739.1200000000003s)]
*  So we cannot fix that in a few weeks. But for sure people at least will be relieved [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2746.5s)]
*  by the fear of being killed in any moment in every place across Gaza. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2753.6400000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Andrea. Abdul Hamid Sayyama from the Arabic Daily Al-Quds Al-Arabi. Thank you [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2762.92s)]
*  for the briefing. And I just don't want to comment about some senior UN official. Still [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2768.96s)]
*  don't call it a genocide after what you have said. But my question, Andrea, is personal. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2775.48s)]
*  How do you cope with these atrocities, seeing what you see day to day? How do you see these [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2782.28s)]
*  children? How can you endure the pain you see in the eyes of women running from their [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2790.28s)]
*  homes? How do you endure seeing a child dying of famine in front of your eyes and you feel [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2797.28s)]
*  helpless to bring him back to life? I remember Chris Gunness in 2008 started crying. And [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2804.44s)]
*  Peter Hansen also, when he visited the family of Mohammed Al-Durrah, he broke down in tears [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2812.6800000000003s)]
*  seeing all these what happened. Please describe that on personal basis. I don't know if you [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2819.04s)]
*  have children or not, but if you please share with us your personal feeling, what you see [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2824.6400000000003s)]
*  during your, when you go to bed at night. Thank you. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2832.08s)]
*  Thank you, Abdul Hamid. I do have children, three of them. And they are of ages that are [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2840.08s)]
*  comparable to many of the children that I've seen in Gaza. And I cannot not think as a [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2848.04s)]
*  parent how I would live the nightmare that these children are going through. And that's [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2856.92s)]
*  why I made a point earlier about the unacceptable situation where recreational children are [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2866.64s)]
*  kids are rejected by Israel because they are not considered humanitarian aid. I found that [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2877.2s)]
*  really problematic. And how I cope with it is, you know, I don't know what will be the [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2887.84s)]
*  long-term impact on many of us, actually. I've seen already colleagues, you know, who [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2899.72s)]
*  are imploding and cracking down and need to be taken out from Gaza because they were not [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2907.4s)]
*  able anymore to do the job that they were supposed to. But I think that the same suffering [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2917.44s)]
*  that is at times making me having a hard time to sleep is the same suffering and desperation [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2924.88s)]
*  for a condition that motivates every day the work we do. I firmly believe that without [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2937.08s)]
*  our presence, without our effort, without our work, the little that has been provided [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2944.24s)]
*  to Gaza today would probably not be there. And only the prevailing rule of the strongest, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2955.2s)]
*  which is certainly not taking care of the vulnerable people, women, children, disabled, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2962.2s)]
*  elderly, they would be in a much worse condition. So I do not have time to cry, even if at times [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2971.3599999999997s)]
*  I have to say that I have to swallow it, simply because I think there is something more important [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2983.16s)]
*  than we have to do today, which is trying to do the best of what we can. And even if [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2988.92s)]
*  it is not, you know, up to the highest standard, it is the best we can do given the prevailing [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=2994.12s)]
*  circumstances that have been imposed on us. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3003.08s)]
*  Okay, Dezhi and then Nabil. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3006.44s)]
*  Andrew, Degis here with China Central Television. Basically, two questions. First, you mentioned [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3009.48s)]
*  about the situation there, the rule of Django, not the rule of law in Gaza. Can you tell [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3014.84s)]
*  us what is the security there for the UN operations, given the fact that two days ago just 70% [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3021.04s)]
*  of a convoy has been looted by what you described as criminals? And second, my colleague Gabriel [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3030.4s)]
*  asked you the question on the possible ceasefire. But my question here is, given the fact you [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3038.1600000000003s)]
*  describe all the situation, how much time do you think the ceasefire could make a difference? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3044.5s)]
*  Six weeks? Can six weeks really make a difference? And second, you mentioned about the trucks. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3050.94s)]
*  It's not a good strategy to contain the trucks. It's a quality. But there's such a destruction [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3056.02s)]
*  there. Do you think that there's even a possibility to get in 600 trucks in the beginning of the [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3061.5s)]
*  ceasefire? Thank you. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3067.7s)]
*  So the security situation is something that we have seen deteriorating already in the [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3072.34s)]
*  past. You might remember there was a moment where we were already saying that there was [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3076.58s)]
*  a breakdown of law and order. Unfortunately, something that we have to deal with because [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3080.34s)]
*  we do not have control over that. The reality is that we have seen not only systematic targeting [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3086.6200000000003s)]
*  of the police in Gaza, and so the system has completely disappeared and hence given us [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3094.62s)]
*  the space to either powerful families or criminals or whatever is remaining of the authorities [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3108.2599999999998s)]
*  in situ. I think it is super important for us to discuss with the communities and explain [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3115.26s)]
*  them. The only reason why we have been able to stay and deliver is because to some degrees [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3129.26s)]
*  we have preserved community acceptance. And we have to discuss with the communities, explain [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3135.42s)]
*  them how we operate, why we do things in a way we do it, in order for them to ensure [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3141.66s)]
*  that our operations are somehow protected and viable. Would we lose that space? It won't [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3148.02s)]
*  be possible for us to operate any longer for us and for our partners. The 600 trucks, it's [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3158.18s)]
*  a good question. I think it is challenging. As I said earlier, it is not about quantity, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3165.8999999999996s)]
*  it is about quality, but even the quantity is a problem, of course. And that would require [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3173.2999999999997s)]
*  a gigantic effort combined of private sector and the United Nations and the partners all [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3178.3799999999997s)]
*  together, the humanitarian community, because it is a very, very ambitious target that will [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3184.8199999999997s)]
*  only be viable if we have, you know, the fact that there is no combat is already something [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3191.82s)]
*  that will allow us to use better the daylight time and more efficiently the resources. Potentially, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3196.78s)]
*  if all the bottlenecks and the challenges that we are facing inside would be solved, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3204.7000000000003s)]
*  you know, the number of assets available would probably some injection of additional trucks, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3212.42s)]
*  will allow us to do multiple rotation that will bring us to the 600. But we won't be [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3219.1s)]
*  able to do it on day one, and we certainly won't be able to do it without the collaboration [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3225.2999999999997s)]
*  and the coordinated effort with the private sector. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3231.22s)]
*  Thank you so much. We'll go to the next question. Nabil, please go ahead. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3236.7799999999997s)]
*  Hi, Nabil Abesab, Al-Arabi TV station. So since Friday, since the announcement on the [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3243.78s)]
*  ceasefire deal came out, until now, have you seen any changes on the ground or do you see [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3253.98s)]
*  any indication that a ceasefire is coming anytime soon? This is my first question. And [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3262.42s)]
*  second, do you know if people can leave Gaza now? Can people leave Gaza now? Do you have [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3270.42s)]
*  any information about some people who have maybe left the Strip? And do you know where [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3282.06s)]
*  would they be going? To what countries? Is it neighboring countries or other countries? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3289.06s)]
*  And my third question is about the Cyprus corridor. I think it's a maritime corridor. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3301.2999999999997s)]
*  Is it still functioning at all? Thank you. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3308.86s)]
*  So I did not see any sign of an impact of the ceasefire or anything that has been related [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3315.38s)]
*  to me by colleagues on the ground. I also have to say that this at the moment is a very [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3323.42s)]
*  high level, strategic and senior political level, so maybe it's not yet trickling down. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3327.6600000000003s)]
*  Of course, we are always wishful and in favor of a ceasefire. We've been asking the ceasefire [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3334.46s)]
*  since the first day of war and I think that is, you know, I wish for all that the ceasefire [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3340.58s)]
*  will indeed stop the noise of the bombs that have shaken up our nights every day when I [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3348.54s)]
*  was there and when I'm not there too. Since the closure of Ra'aq to my knowledge, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3359.2599999999998s)]
*  no Palestinians have left Gaza. This is one of the very nefarious effects that we have [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3366.26s)]
*  seen with the closure of Gaza, sorry, of Ra'aq because we don't have to forget that despite [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3378.7400000000002s)]
*  relatively limited, Ra'aq was the only exit point for not only the few civilians that [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3386.82s)]
*  have managed to leave Gaza, but also for all the medical referrals that were and the only [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3394.82s)]
*  medical referrals that were possible to evacuate from Gaza. Since then, since the 7th of May, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3401.06s)]
*  there's been not any single movement through Ra'aq and there's not been a single movement [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3411.34s)]
*  of Palestinians outside of the street. The maritime corridor, as you have followed the [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3418.54s)]
*  news, there has been bad weather that that damaged the pier. To my knowledge, it was [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3425.54s)]
*  supposed to be repaired by today. I still have not had the report from the teams on [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3430.98s)]
*  the ground that it has been repaired. But, you know, we have always said that the maritime [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3436.1400000000003s)]
*  corridor is welcome as an additionality to the existing land route that are irreplaceable. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3442.1400000000003s)]
*  The volumes that we were able to handle at the peak of the particularly Karen Shalom, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3450.1400000000003s)]
*  Karen Maboussal and Conway corridor will never be reached through the maritime corridor. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3457.82s)]
*  The maritime corridor, to my understanding, has brought in up to a maximum of 30 trucks. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3465.82s)]
*  It was still on the initial stages of the operations. Maybe it could go beyond that. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3474.34s)]
*  I hope so. But as we said repeatedly, it cannot substitute access to route. So Zakim, Eretz, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3479.1800000000003s)]
*  96 or Karen Shalom are all options that should be pursued and should be maintained as the [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3487.18s)]
*  backbone of the entry of goods and humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3495.58s)]
*  Thank you. Stefano, you have a question. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3502.4199999999996s)]
*  Thank you. This is Stefano Vaccaro, La Voce in New York, Italpress. You have been working [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3504.8599999999997s)]
*  in humanitarian programs for, I would say, about 25 years. When you entered the career [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3512.54s)]
*  at the UN, did you expect, I mean, somebody that came from a humanitarian work then and [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3522.2200000000003s)]
*  that worked for the UN, did you expect that there was going to be a situation where you [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3531.9s)]
*  thought that the UN could actually, you know, make a difference, help people, but it couldn't? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3537.62s)]
*  I just want to end my question with this. Last week, Filippo Grandi at the Security [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3548.62s)]
*  Council had the very harsh words for the Security Council. He said that your cacophony is creating [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3556.02s)]
*  chaos. Basically, he had very bad, I never heard him speaking like this. So what would [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3564.02s)]
*  it be, if you had the possibility to be in front of the Security Council in this moment, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3574.62s)]
*  what you will say? And do you have any advice for young humanitarians that would like to [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3579.58s)]
*  work for the UN? What would be your advice now? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3587.14s)]
*  Thank you, Stefano. I joined the UN, of course, because I believe on the values that it represents [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3595.62s)]
*  and I still believe that the UN can make the difference when it is allowed to operate in [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3606.14s)]
*  its full ability and with the necessary enabling environment around us that allow us to do [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3613.46s)]
*  the job that we are able to do when we are not victims of constraints imposed on us. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3622.7s)]
*  I think that one of the concerning, unintended probably, but surely concerning, is the fact [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3631.06s)]
*  that the UN is guided by the rules that member states have agreed upon and they have to promote [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3643.3799999999997s)]
*  and protect. So it is the responsibility of all the member states to make sure that we [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3660.2999999999997s)]
*  are allowed and empowered to deliver our mandate in each country and country. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3665.98s)]
*  So, I think that is the most important part and sector of what the UN is about. From humanitarian [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3673.14s)]
*  assistance when it comes to OCHAD, then to the right of the children for UNICEF, the [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3681.14s)]
*  right of health for WHO and so on and so forth. And I think that this is what is the most [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3686.14s)]
*  challenging situation that I have been in, at least, in my professional career where [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3691.14s)]
*  we are unable to allow us to do what they have asked us to do. And this is something [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3698.14s)]
*  that is challenging the very foundation of the essence of what the UN is about. And that [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3704.62s)]
*  should be worrying every single member state because it is something that casts a shadow [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3713.8599999999997s)]
*  on the ability of the United Nations to promote that rule-based system based on human rights [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3721.86s)]
*  that we should all protect, promote and adhere to. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3730.94s)]
*  Thank you so much, Andrea. If nobody else has any other question for Andrea, we would [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3739.1800000000003s)]
*  like to thank you so much for joining us from Jerusalem. Andrea DiDomenica, the head of [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3743.6600000000003s)]
*  OCHAD in the Palestinian territory. And please wait for Farhan. He is going to come now and [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3747.8599999999997s)]
*  brief you. Thank you so much. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR9oImrHJuk&t=3753.2599999999998s)]
