# Palestine on the Security Council Resolution on Gaza - Security Council Media Stakeout
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww)
*  Hello. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=0.0s)]
*  I just arrived from the airport to the Security Council. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=8.68s)]
*  I was in a mission in the Middle East and I just got back. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=14.0s)]
*  I was watching the deliberation of the Security Council in the car. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=19.44s)]
*  As you all know, the Palestinian leadership welcomed this effort, this step in the right [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=28.54s)]
*  direction, and emphasized that, of course, our position has been always to have an immediate [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=37.66s)]
*  ceasefire to stop the killing of our people. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  So this resolution is a step in that direction. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=52.78s)]
*  We are grateful for our brothers in Algeria, whom we worked with them very closely, to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=56.78s)]
*  try to influence the draft resolution to be closer to the objectives of the national rights [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  of the Palestinian people. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=70.58s)]
*  We succeeded to a certain extent, but of course, we did not succeed in all the things that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=73.22s)]
*  we wanted. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=81.14s)]
*  But nevertheless, we welcome this step, and I believe that all the Palestinians welcome [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=82.86s)]
*  this step. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=89.94s)]
*  We want to have a ceasefire. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=90.94s)]
*  We want to see the implementation of the objective of stopping the fighting completely and to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=93.62s)]
*  have humanitarian assistance to our people to the level that they need, to stop the forced [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=101.22s)]
*  transfer, to allow our people to return to the areas where they were pushed out of in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=108.06s)]
*  all parts of the Gaza Strip, including the north, and to see the Israeli forces outside [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=114.74s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, and not a single portion of the Gaza Strip geographically, to be taken [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  or under the control of the Israeli occupying forces. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=128.42s)]
*  And of course, we welcome the reference that the occupied Palestinian territory, including [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=133.74s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, is part and parcel of the land of the state of Palestine, in which this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=140.02s)]
*  occupation has to end from that occupied land so that we can enjoy freedom, independence, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  and to live in dignity in our state, the state of Palestine, with East Jerusalem. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=154.62s)]
*  Now the burden is on the Israeli side to implement this resolution and to have the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=161.22s)]
*  ceasefire immediately in place, and also to have the exchange, including the release of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=170.7s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners, and to make this ceasefire a permanent ceasefire. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=177.7s)]
*  We want also to thank the effort of the mediators, especially our brothers in Egypt and Qatar, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=185.18s)]
*  and we hope that we can see the beginning of the process of the implementation of this [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=193.26000000000002s)]
*  important resolution, which is a step in the right place, as our Palestinian leadership [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=199.02s)]
*  has declared. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  I am sure that you will be able to receive all the statements that were released in this [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  connection. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=213.78s)]
*  We the Palestinian people are united in seeing the implementation of this resolution. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=215.22s)]
*  Thank you very much for being with us. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=222.66s)]
*  Q Well, the argument that this resolution will be implemented, given the fact that, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=224.66s)]
*  despite the fact that the Americans are saying that the Israelis accepted this offer, we [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=232.34s)]
*  still until now didn't hear any official Israeli statement in that regard. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=238.54s)]
*  Did you get any insurance that this will be implemented, that the Israelis did actually [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=243.38s)]
*  agree? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, the proof is in the details, and we want to see that this resolution to be implemented [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  beginning with the ceasefire, and that this ceasefire to be permanent, we do not want [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=259.06s)]
*  to see the continuation of the fighting. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=265.34s)]
*  We lost a tremendous amount of people, and we want to see the end of this onslaught against [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=269.82s)]
*  our people, and of course we will continue pursuing justice and accountability through [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=278.58s)]
*  international mechanisms, legal mechanisms, and here I'm referring to the ICJ and to the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=285.17999999999995s)]
*  and those who committed one additional massacre in Seirat last Saturday should face justice. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=292.86s)]
*  Those who were responsible for giving the orders and executing that order should be [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=302.26s)]
*  brought to justice. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  In fact, I'm sure that you've seen my letter which was sent to the Security Council based [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=309.14s)]
*  on instructions from my leadership telling me to ask for an emergency meeting of the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=315.98s)]
*  Security Council, so part of the discussion that took place today, especially from many [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=322.98s)]
*  of our friends and specifically from Algeria, reflects our point of view that those who [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=329.5s)]
*  are committing these atrocities and crimes and genocide against the Palestinian people [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=335.54s)]
*  should face the justice that they deserve and accountability should be in place. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=340.9s)]
*  We will continue our efforts in the Security Council as well as in the General Assembly [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  and the Human Rights Council to seek justice for our people, to stop these crimes against [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=353.44s)]
*  our people, and to allow for the conditions to be put in place to rebuild Gaza, to rebuild [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=360.74s)]
*  Gaza, to reconstruct it, and to open a path for a peaceful option or road that would lead [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=370.9s)]
*  to the end of the occupation and independence of the state of Palestine with East Jerusalem [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  as its capital. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=386.46s)]
*  Abdulhamid. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=387.86s)]
*  Thank you, Ambassador Riyad. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=389.74s)]
*  We just had an argument with Ambassador Robert Wood. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=392.14s)]
*  We kept telling him that Hamas had accepted this resolution. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=396.02s)]
*  The Israelis didn't. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=400.26s)]
*  And in the resolution, it includes that Israel accepted it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=402.58s)]
*  So where we stand now, where is the ball now, in which courts, the Israelis or the Palestinians? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what he said to you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=414.74s)]
*  Just know I came immediately to this podium. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=416.42s)]
*  But I can tell you that there is readiness from the Palestinian side to engage very seriously [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=419.42s)]
*  to see the implementation of this resolution. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=427.42s)]
*  The number one item in that resolution is to have a ceasefire, to end this fighting, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=431.42s)]
*  and we are determined with our friends to make it a long-lasting permanent ceasefire. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=439.38s)]
*  So the proof is in the pudding. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=446.54s)]
*  We will see who are the ones who are interested to see this resolution to become a reality, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=448.66s)]
*  and those who are obstructing it and they want to continue the war of genocide against [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=456.14000000000004s)]
*  our people. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=461.26000000000005s)]
*  But in reality, you can't control what Hamas is going to do. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=463.42s)]
*  So we think, we hope Hamas is going to implement it too. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=471.92s)]
*  So what would be your position if Hamas doesn't respect the ceasefire? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=475.8s)]
*  Well, you know, you're dealing with hypothetical issues. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=481.8s)]
*  I represent all the Palestinian people at the United Nations. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=485.34s)]
*  I did not hear any Palestinian saying anything other than welcoming this resolution and readiness [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=490.65999999999997s)]
*  and willingness to engage in the process of its implementation. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=498.29999999999995s)]
*  So therefore, the basis of your question is not sound. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=503.05999999999995s)]
*  Those who are potentially going to not honor and respect this resolution is the Israeli [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=508.78s)]
*  side. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=515.98s)]
*  So therefore, let's watch closely whether we will see a beginning of process for serious [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=516.5799999999999s)]
*  implementation of this resolution or we will see sides that one side that will try to find [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=522.18s)]
*  any excuse in order not to meet the commitment that this resolution require from Israel. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=530.6999999999999s)]
*  And also I want to bring to your attention the representative of Israel, whom I understand [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=539.06s)]
*  will not be the representative of Israel soon, cursed everyone in the General Assembly, in [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=545.5799999999999s)]
*  the Security Council, in all parts of the UN, rebelling against the charter of the UN, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=552.3399999999999s)]
*  rebelling against Security Council resolutions, rebelling against decisions by the ICJ about, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=559.3399999999999s)]
*  you know, provisional measures to take place to stop the killing of the Palestinian people, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=567.34s)]
*  not to storm Rafah. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=573.34s)]
*  So judge them by what they say and what they do. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=576.1s)]
*  Don't try to look for others who are not, you know, violating international law and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=581.7800000000001s)]
*  resolutions of the Security Council. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=590.6600000000001s)]
*  At any rate, the few days to come would be important days for all of us to watch. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=592.78s)]
*  Anybody wants to ask me a question in Arabic? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=598.98s)]
*  Ambassador, I wish I speak Arabic. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=601.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=604.26s)]
*  The question is, everybody agrees to, I mean, everybody approved this resolution, but what [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=604.54s)]
*  do you think should be the first step and do you think it should come from Hamas or [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=610.86s)]
*  from Israel and what do you think about that? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=614.5s)]
*  Well, we see that the parties, as Abdulhamid said, you know, that the Palestinian side [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=618.1800000000001s)]
*  is saying that they welcome the resolution and they are ready and willing to engage in [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=622.7s)]
*  a process with the mediators in order, you know, to see the implementation of this resolution [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=629.22s)]
*  starting with immediate ceasefire to be put in place. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=636.62s)]
*  So we will see what the other side who is not articulating themselves with such clarity [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=641.3000000000001s)]
*  yet we will see how they behave and based on that you will make your judgment and based [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=647.22s)]
*  on that the Security Council should make sure that its resolution has to be implemented. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=652.7s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-3CEy_Usww&t=659.74s)]
