# Gaza: Testimonials from Nuseirat Attack Survivors | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [June 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c)
*  In the morning at about 11 a.m. there's gunshots and explosion everywhere. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=0.0s)]
*  It's like a day. We don't know what's happened. We just see the people running away, children in the streets, the death everywhere. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=13.0s)]
*  The first attack the Israeli military targeted a school where displaced people thought that they had found safety and dozens of people were killed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=25.0s)]
*  As you see, you can come. You can see my house, or it was my house, and I was shocked and scared and everything. And we couldn't even think about everything. We didn't take anything with us. I go there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=39.0s)]
*  The bombs just started falling relentlessly and everyone was wondering what was happening. The fighting was so intense. More than 300 women, children and men have been killed here in just three days. That's according to the Ministry of Health. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=63.0s)]
*  That was my house. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=78.0s)]
*  That was my house. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=86.0s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=88.0s)]
*  I went up. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=91.0s)]
*  In the same day, and the same time, they made explosion here and here. I didn't see anything on that day. Everything black, like, for two minutes. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=96.0s)]
*  My hope is that it will end as soon as possible. We will build these homes, destroy homes, not for us, maybe for another generation, for our children. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=110.0s)]
*  This violence has to end. This war has to end. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sa3RnCcD8c&t=125.0s)]
