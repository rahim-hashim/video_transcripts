*  Our deadline is mid-November. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofC49K41f_k&t=0.0s)]
*  Whilst at that time, the immunity of children who have received that first dose will rapidly decline. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofC49K41f_k&t=4.0s)]
*  Children in northern Gaza will not be protected. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofC49K41f_k&t=14.0s)]
*  And polio is a dangerous disease. Polio paralyzes. It can actually kill. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofC49K41f_k&t=21.0s)]
*  So these children are at grave risk. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofC49K41f_k&t=26.0s)]
*  This is a risk not just to the 120,000 children who remain in northern Gaza, children aged 10 and below, that is, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofC49K41f_k&t=29.0s)]
*  but also to children in the larger region. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofC49K41f_k&t=38.0s)]
*  And that's why we are so incredibly worried and pressing for this second round to happen by beginning of November. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofC49K41f_k&t=42.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofC49K41f_k&t=56.0s)]
