# Israel on the IPC report, Gaza, Iran & other topics - Security Council Media Stakeout
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c)
*  Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Donon, will deliver a brief statement ahead of this [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=7.0s)]
*  afternoon's Security Council session. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=11.52s)]
*  He will take your questions afterwards. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=13.84s)]
*  If you have a question, please remember to state your name and your media outlet. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=19.96s)]
*  Hello, good afternoon. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=22.96s)]
*  The IPC recently published a report filled with baseless and slanderous claims against [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=28.68s)]
*  the State of Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=33.84s)]
*  Its assessment following previous ones, which have all been proven incorrect, lacks credibility. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=35.72s)]
*  They rely on biased, prejudiced sources to recycle outright lies rather than focusing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=42.84s)]
*  on genuine, meaningful assistance. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=49.56s)]
*  As I have said here in the past, there are agencies dedicated to real humanitarian work, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=52.64s)]
*  and then there are those like the IPC which prioritize smearing Israel over actually helping [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=59.56s)]
*  those in need. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=66.24s)]
*  The IPC's report, like its previous reports, is riddled with inaccuracies by its own figures. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=68.16s)]
*  The situation in Gaza, including in northern Gaza, has shown improvement since October. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=76.08s)]
*  Yet, instead of recognizing this, the IPC chooses to ignore facts, pushing a narrative [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=82.4s)]
*  detached from reality and hostile to the truth. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=90.2s)]
*  In today's session in the Security Council, I will counter the IPC's claims point by [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=94.36s)]
*  exposing the inaccuracy of its claims by detailing Israel's extensive humanitarian efforts across [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=100.2s)]
*  all of Gaza. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=107.68s)]
*  I urge the Security Council and the entire international community to focus on supporting [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=109.88s)]
*  agencies that truly work to ease suffering rather than those invested in spreading harmful [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  propaganda. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=121.48s)]
*  We have released mountains of evidence on the anger that Gaza's civilians feel toward [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=123.2s)]
*  Hamas and Hamas's torture of civilians. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=131.52s)]
*  The Council must listen to the cries of the Gaza people themselves, seize their obsession [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=135.6s)]
*  with Israel, and focus their energy on eliminating the true oppressors of Gaza, Hamas terrorists. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=142.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=150.4s)]
*  I want to congratulate my dear friend, Governor Mike Huckabee. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=153.2s)]
*  I think he will be a great ambassador to Israel. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=179.32s)]
*  He is very familiar with the facts on the ground. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=182.28s)]
*  I think he visited Israel dozens of times. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=185.84s)]
*  You know, he had like a yearly visit to Israel, and I had the honor to escort him. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=188.24s)]
*  Also after October 7th, he came and I took him to visit the sites on Kfar Aza, Beiri, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=193.36s)]
*  and other locations where the massacre took place. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=199.56s)]
*  So we will welcome him, and we will be expecting his arrival. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=202.3s)]
*  Have you spoken with him? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=205.32s)]
*  Not yet, but I will speak with him today. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=207.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=209.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=210.08s)]
*  Comedie Intekhabi Fahed, Independent Persian. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=211.88000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday, Prince Mohammed bin Salman calls on Israel to respect Iran's sovereignty. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=215.08s)]
*  And also, he said an absolute rejection of the Israeli attack on Gaza and Lebanon. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=221.4s)]
*  I would like to hear your comment on these challenges. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=227.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=230.56s)]
*  Well, you know, we respect our neighbors. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=231.56s)]
*  We know that the aggression comes from Iran. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=234.24s)]
*  They were the ones who attacked Israel with hundreds of missiles. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  I would advise them not to try to take advantage of the transition period. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=241.72s)]
*  You know, from today until January 20th, you have more than two months. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  So maybe someone in Iran thinks that they can take advantage of that, and I would advise [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  them not to do it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=254.12s)]
*  We have proven that they are vulnerable. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=255.12s)]
*  We have proven that we can target any place in Iran we wish to do so. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=257.32s)]
*  We are a peaceful nation, but if Iran will attack us, they will see more capabilities [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=262.76s)]
*  of the IDF. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=268.92s)]
*  Ambassador, today the UN spokesperson said that October has seen the least amount of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=269.92s)]
*  aid getting into Gaza this year. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=275.68s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=278.4s)]
*  So I will share with my colleagues in the Security Council the numbers we have about [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=279.4s)]
*  the trucks that entered Gaza. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=283.52s)]
*  We will show them that we are working harder to support the humanitarian need in Gaza. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=285.88s)]
*  Today we opened another crossing, Kisufim, which is in the center of Gaza. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=292.44s)]
*  This crossing was closed in 2005 and it was reopened today in order to allow more aid [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  to enter Gaza. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=304.4s)]
*  As you try to stop UNRWA's operations, how do you plan to stop its right of refugees [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=305.4s)]
*  to return? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=312.96s)]
*  No, first of all, we haven't stopped UNRWA's operation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=313.96s)]
*  We decided about what we will do in Israel and we decided that we will not cooperate [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=318.28s)]
*  with UNRWA in Israel, but we are not controlling the activities of UNRWA. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=323.96s)]
*  I would expect the countries here to do exactly like the U.S., which decided to stop funding [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  to UNRWA, to follow the U.S. on this, and to divert funding to other NGOs who focus [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=334.4s)]
*  on real humanitarian aid and not fostering terrorism. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  But if you're not going to cooperate with UNRWA, why would the other agencies want to [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=344.56s)]
*  donate to the entity if you're not going to cooperate and hurt their operations? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=350.2s)]
*  No, I think we should work and others should donate to other NGOs, WHO, UNICEF, World Food [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=354.91999999999996s)]
*  Bank, that focus on humanitarian activities and not on promoting hatred against Israel [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=363.08s)]
*  and not paying terrorists. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=370.08s)]
*  You know, tomorrow there will be a debate about UNRWA in the fourth committee and I [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=372.2s)]
*  intend to come there, so I recommend that you will be there tomorrow morning. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=378.0s)]
*  And do I have the refugees to return? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=381.0s)]
*  I will allow other questions with your permission. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=383.24s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=385.56s)]
*  The State Department just announced that they won't be hosting arms to Israel, given their [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=386.56s)]
*  satisfaction of the aid coming in. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=392.16s)]
*  What's your response to that? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=395.16s)]
*  Well, I welcome the statement from the State Department. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=396.56s)]
*  We work very closely with our allies in Washington and as I stated earlier, we did a lot. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=399.96s)]
*  We work very hard in order to assist the humanitarian needs in Gaza. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=406.76s)]
*  And it's challenging, Ben, because on the other side you have Hamas. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=411.96s)]
*  So even if we allow trucks to cross the checkpoints, Hamas will hijack the trucks. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=415.96s)]
*  And sometimes, even when we do 100%, we cannot guarantee the results. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=421.96s)]
*  But I'm happy to see that there was progress and I'm happy to hear that statement from [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=427.92s)]
*  the State Department. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=431.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgtvxL6a26c&t=432.88s)]
