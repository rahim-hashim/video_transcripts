# Palestine: Committee on the Rights of Palestinian People - Press Briefing | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k)
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, members of the Kulisak, permanent representative of Senegal and newly elected [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=17.0s)]
*  chair of the committee on the exercise of the inalienable rights of Palestinian people for 2025. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=22.48s)]
*  We address you following the committee's first meeting of 2005 during which the bureau was [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  elected by acclamation. The newly elected bureau comprises His Excellency Nabil Jers from Namibia, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=36.72s)]
*  vice chair. His Excellency Jem Hermida Castillo from Nicaragua, vice chair. His Excellency Armanata [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=45.68s)]
*  Christian Wan Nasir, Indonesia, vice chair. His Excellency Ernesto Soborio Guzman, Cuba, vice chair. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=55.68s)]
*  His Excellency Ahmad Faisal, Muhammad Malaysia, vice chair and reporter. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=65.44s)]
*  We are also joined by His Excellency Riyad Mansour, permanent observer of the state of Palestine. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=70.08s)]
*  As chair, I reaffirm the committee's unwavering commitment to Palestinian rights. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=81.44s)]
*  On 31st January, the bureau welcomed the Gaza ceasefire as a critical step in halting military [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=88.64s)]
*  operation and addressing immense humanitarian suffering. We demand its full implementation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=97.6s)]
*  and sustained humanitarian access for Gaza's 2.2 million residents who face devastation, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=104.24s)]
*  displacement and disease. The committee commends the mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=112.08s)]
*  United States and urges continued engagement, especially by the Security Council, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=120.88s)]
*  toward a lasting cessation of hostilities and the release of all hostages. However, we strongly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  condemn Israel's ban on UNRWA, which obstructs vital humanitarian operation in direct violation [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=135.76s)]
*  of the UN mandate and General Assembly resolutions. UNRWA is irreplaceable in stabilizing the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=144.08s)]
*  ceasefire and supporting Gaza's recovery. This ban imposed immediately after the ceasefire deal [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=152.08s)]
*  will deepen Gaza's suffering not throughout airstrike but throughout deprivation, hunger [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=160.24s)]
*  and disease. We call on Israel to immediately reverse this decision, which accelerates humanitarian [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=167.44s)]
*  collapse. As reaffirmed by the International Court of Justice, Israel as the occupying power [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=174.8s)]
*  has no sovereignty in the occupied Palestinian territory including East Jerusalem, where UNRWA [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=182.32s)]
*  operates. This ban is unlawful as occupation itself and must end. We strongly condemn the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=189.6s)]
*  excessive and indiscriminate use of force by Israeli forces and demand the immediate lifting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=197.92s)]
*  of the siege on the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank and the immediate stop to the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=205.12s)]
*  deliberate destruction of neighborhoods and homes using explosives. The devastation in Jenin has [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=212.48s)]
*  resulted in the collapse of critical infrastructure including UNRWA's health clinic which was bombed [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=220.56s)]
*  in recent attacks. Humanitarian aid to refugees must be allowed to enter to restore essential [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  services and provide urgent relief. Looking ahead, the committee's 2025 program of work [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=235.04s)]
*  prioritized diplomatic engagement, mobilizing member states and engaging the Security Council, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=243.76s)]
*  awareness raising and advocacy including global dissemination of updates, information and knowledge [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  via social media and committee website. Cooperation including partnering with [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=258.96s)]
*  intergovernmental and CSOs and NGOs and capacity building supporting Palestinian government [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=265.76s)]
*  staff training. We rely on the media to keep focused to expose the rampant violations, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=273.35999999999996s)]
*  occupation and threats to a viable two-state solution. I now give the floor to His Excellency [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  Riyad Mansour. Thank you Mr. Chairman and congratulations for being elected as the chairman [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=286.4s)]
*  of the committee and the bureau and also congratulations to my colleague the vice chair. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  As we all know the mandate of this unique committee of its kind at the United Nations, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=302.08s)]
*  the mandate by the General Assembly is to help the Palestinian people for the attainment of their [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=308.08s)]
*  inalienable rights including their right to self-determination, statehood and the right of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=314.56s)]
*  the refugees to return. So this is the mandate legislated by the General Assembly for this [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=321.44s)]
*  committee and this committee is working day and night in order to fulfill this mandate [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=328.96s)]

*  very soon and it will add to their activities through mandates from the General Assembly [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=361.84s)]
*  not only to commemorate the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people in November [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=368.88s)]
*  29 but as legislated by the General Assembly we will start commemorating annually on the 15th of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=376.64s)]
*  May the day of Nakba for the Palestinian people. We in the state of Palestine and the Palestinian [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=385.68s)]

*  in place in order to help the Palestinian people to attain their inalienable national rights [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=400.08s)]
*  to accomplish their objectives for freedom and dignity. We know that the committee is also [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=406.32s)]
*  against all of the evil things that are happening against our people in the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=413.44s)]
*  It was and still active at the legal front also with legal teams in the ICJ and the ICC [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=418.32s)]
*  for the historic articulation of the ICJ of its advisory opinion in which it characterized [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  this occupation as being illegal and therefore it has to be terminated as quickly as possible. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=432.88s)]
*  In the many efforts and programs that we are involved in the committee will be very active [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=439.76s)]
*  in the preparation for the international conference coming June in order to see this [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=447.76s)]
*  illegal occupation being terminated and the two-state solution to become a reality. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=455.44s)]

*  in the defense of UNRWA for the continuation of its noble work for serving the six million [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=489.44s)]
*  plus Palestine refugees through a mandate given to it by the general assembly and no country has [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=496.64s)]
*  the power to change that mandate illegally as the state of Israel tried to do. So we are grateful for [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  the committee is doing along with more than 125 countries at the United Nations in defending [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=513.3599999999999s)]
*  UNRWA, in funding UNRWA, in continuing the work of UNRWA until there is a just political [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=519.5999999999999s)]
*  solution to the refugee questions through the implementation of resolution 194 of the general [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=526.56s)]
*  assembly. The committee is very active in many things and we are grateful for this effort of the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=533.04s)]
*  committee. It is the last committee of its kind in the United Nations. It has a mandate from the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=539.2s)]
*  general assembly. It is well respected by the great majority of member states and we are proud in the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=546.4000000000001s)]
*  state of Palestine that we have this committee at the United Nations to help us for the attainment [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=553.5200000000001s)]
*  of our inalienable rights. With regard you might ask of some of the statements that were made [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=560.48s)]
*  recently that some you know that the idea of kicking the Palestinian people over from the Gaza [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=566.8s)]
*  Strip. I just want to tell you that during the last 24 hours statements from heads of states of [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=575.04s)]
*  Egypt, of Jordan, of the state of Palestine, of Saudi Arabia and many countries including countries [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=582.0s)]
*  who spoke in the debate in the room behind us during the meeting of the committee. They condemn [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=588.88s)]
*  these efforts. There is global consensus on not allowing you know forced transfer to take place, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=597.28s)]
*  ethnic cleansing to take place. We Palestinians love every part of the state of Palestine. We [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=608.24s)]
*  love the Gaza Strip. It is part of our DNA. Our people marched in few hours in the span of two [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=614.08s)]
*  days from the south to the north more than 400,000 of them to go to the rubbles in the northern Gaza [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=622.1600000000001s)]
*  in order to start cleaning around their destroyed homes. These are our homes. This is a very precious [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=629.76s)]
*  part of the state of Palestine and we will never leave it. We will clean it. We will reconstruct it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=636.8000000000001s)]
*  We will rebuild it. We will make it a very beautiful part of the state of Palestine. We [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=643.52s)]
*  do not need anyone to kick us out in order to do something else in it and there is consensus among [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=649.6s)]
*  the Arabs and the Muslims on this issue because it was decided in two summits in Riyadh during [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=657.68s)]
*  the course of the year 2024, twice the summits of the Arabs and the Muslims in which they said [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  we fight against the crime against humanity of displacement whether internally or from Gaza, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=672.7199999999999s)]
*  outside Gaza. There is no place for us except Palestine and Gaza is an important part of [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=680.0s)]
*  Palestine. We want the ceasefire to be permanent. We want all provisions of the agreement to be [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  implemented and we want this aggression against our people in the northern part of the Gaza Strip [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=693.6s)]
*  to be stopped. We condemn it and we want the Israeli forces to withdraw from Jenin, from the [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=700.4s)]
*  refugee camp of Jenin, from Tulkarem, from the refugee camp of Tulkarem, from the northern part [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=708.4s)]
*  of the West Bank, from all of the West Bank. We want the end of this illegal occupation. Thank you [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=716.16s)]
*  very much. You know the media is a good friend of the cause of Palestine. We appreciate your work. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=722.16s)]
*  We appreciate covering the stories related to Palestine. You are a very important part [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=728.08s)]
*  of the struggle for justice for the Palestinian people and we thank you for your work. Thank you [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=734.24s)]
*  very much. Some questions? Well, the chairman, you want to take some questions? Okay, yes sir. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=739.2800000000001s)]
*  Yes, Stefano Vaccare, Italpress, La Voce di New York. It seems, I mean very timing meeting of course, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=750.24s)]
*  but it seems like the Trump administration changed slightly what he said yesterday because today they [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=761.36s)]
*  started to talk about a temporary remove of the Palestinians just for cleaning up or reconstruct [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=769.4s)]
*  the Gaza. So what is your ambassador, but also the committee, what is the response to President [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=780.16s)]
*  Trump? Apparently yesterday they did maybe a language mistake talking about permanently, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=788.8s)]
*  but he's fixing Gaza and then the Palestinian can return. What is your answer to President Trump? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=794.88s)]
*  Do you want to say something, Mr. Chairman? Great. You want to? Okay. Well, for us, and I said heads of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=802.16s)]
*  states in the Middle East from among the Arab group and many governments made statements that, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=809.8s)]
*  including the Secretary General of the United Nations, a few days ago and he repeated that today [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=818.84s)]
*  in the meeting of the committee on the exercise of the inalienable rights. Ethnic cleansing is [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=825.56s)]
*  unacceptable. In the agreement which the current administration played a role in reaching that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=832.96s)]
*  agreement of the three stages, there is a provision that says the reconstruction of Gaza and people [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=842.64s)]
*  in Gaza to go back to the places where they lived in. So these are the facts and we are determined [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=851.36s)]
*  to honor and respect these facts and therefore that is the policy that has been announced and [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=861.88s)]
*  declared. So anything else other than that cannot materialize and those who are explaining themselves, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=869.48s)]
*  these are, you know, you can ask them these issues, but that's what we, the international community, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=878.44s)]
*  led by the Secretary General of the UN, that's what international law stipulates. That is what the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=885.92s)]
*  Arabs and the Muslims position at the level of the summit. This is the position of many countries, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=892.9599999999999s)]
*  including in Europe and in all corners of the globe. They will not allow ethnic cleansing to [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=899.8399999999999s)]
*  take place. Abdulhamid. Thank you. Thank you, Ambassador. I have two questions, one for the [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=908.3199999999999s)]
*  chairman of the committee and one for Ambassador Riyadh. Ambassador Sik, do you see that there is a [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=914.16s)]
*  war, a comprehensive war against the Palestinians to annihilate their cause? There is a war in the [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=921.6s)]
*  West Bank and dismantling of UNHRWA, attacking on the destruction of Gaza and also put out to that [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=928.24s)]
*  the statement of Trump to force eviction of the Palestinian people. Put them together, you see a [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=936.52s)]
*  comprehensive war against the Palestinian people. What could be done to end that many faceted war [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=943.72s)]
*  against the Palestinians? What could be done is just to implement the resolutions of United Nation, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=952.8s)]
*  the General Assembly, Secretary-Council resolutions. The committee is working based on a mandate and [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=959.76s)]
*  based on what have been decided by the international community. If you respect what we have decided in [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=966.88s)]
*  the United Nations in this same place, I think that we could find a solution for this war and make [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=974.2s)]
*  sure that Palestinian people will get their inalienable rights based on all decision resolutions [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=983.8000000000001s)]

*  international community. Now people can make comment but we are hopeful that with the Secretary-General [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1015.8399999999999s)]
*  and all efforts around the world we could get a solution on this crisis. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1024.84s)]
*  My question to Ambassador Riyad. In 2018 when Trump himself recognized Jerusalem as the state [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1032.24s)]
*  capital of Israel, the eternal capital, you brought up a draft resolution to the Security Council. It [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1042.4s)]
*  was vetoed, it was voted 14 against 1 and then you took the issue to the General Assembly and [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1049.0s)]
*  there was a vast majority of votes against recognizing Jerusalem as the eternal capital [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1054.92s)]
*  of Israel. Would you do similar steps this time? Well I am aware and maybe you are also aware that [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1061.0800000000002s)]

*  to the General Assembly? We might, but the tactics of what we did last year were affected by the [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1243.5s)]
*  conditions of last year. The tactics that we will use now it will be affected by the condition of [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1251.8999999999999s)]
*  this moment, but the objective is the same, to stop aggression against our people, to have a ceasefire, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1259.34s)]
*  to save lives of the Palestinian people and to reconstruct the Gaza Strip and to open doors for [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1265.5s)]

*  from what President Trump said last night. He said the only reason the Palestinians want to go [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1343.74s)]
*  back to Gaza is they have no alternative. He went on to say the U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1348.14s)]
*  We will do a job with it. We'll own it. I'd like to hear your immediate reaction when you heard those [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhL2Ln6La3k&t=1354.94s)]
