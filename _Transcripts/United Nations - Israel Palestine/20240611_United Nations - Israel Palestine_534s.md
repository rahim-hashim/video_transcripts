Video Description: UN Secretary-General António Guterres addresses the plenary session of the High-Level Conference "Call for Action: Urgent Humanitarian Response for Gaza" in Amman, Jordan.

A comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza linked to the release of all remaining hostages cannot come too soon, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Tuesday, as he welcomed the Security Council resolution adopted a day earlier seeking an end to the war there.

Speaking in Jordan at an international conference prompted by the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, Mr. Guterres insisted that after more than eight months of intense hostilities, “the horror must stop”.

“I welcome the peace initiative recently outlined by President Biden and urge all parties to seize this opportunity and come to an agreement,” the UN chief said. “And I call on all parties to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law. This includes facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid both into and inside Gaza, as they have committed. All available routes into Gaza must be operational – and the land routes are absolutely crucial.”

On Monday, the United States-drafted text urged Hamas to accept a ceasefire proposal announced on 31 May by President Joe Biden that has already been accepted by Israel, according to the White House.

The text urges both parties to fully implement the terms of the proposal “without delay and without condition”. It was adopted by a large majority with 14 votes in favour and Russia abstaining – choosing not to exercise its veto power.

*  people of Gaza that are under fire in the most dramatic circumstances. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=27.28s)]
*  It's now eight months since the horrific Hamas terror attacks on 7 October and the abduction [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=34.24s)]
*  of Israeli men, women and children to Gaza. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=40.0s)]
*  But eight months of relentless suffering for Palestinian civilians in Gaza. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  The speed and scale of the carnage and killing in Gaza is beyond anything in my ears as Secretary-General. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=50.12s)]
*  At least 1.7 million people, 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced many times [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=60.36s)]
*  over by Israel military attacks. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=69.28s)]
*  Nowhere is safe. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=74.68s)]
*  Conditions are deplorable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  The public health situation is beyond crisis level. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=80.44s)]
*  Gaza's hospitals lie in ruins. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=84.0s)]
*  Medical supplies and fuel are scarce or non-existent. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=87.88s)]
*  More than 1 million Palestinians in Gaza do not have enough clean drinking water and face [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=93.64s)]
*  desperate levels of hunger. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=100.36s)]
*  Over 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=103.68s)]
*  And despite the ocean of needs, at least half of all humanitarian aid missions are denied [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=110.36000000000001s)]
*  access, impeded or cancelled due to operational or security reasons. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  On top of all these, since the attack on the Rafah border crossing one month ago, the flow [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=125.48s)]
*  of critical humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza, which was already woefully [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=132.88s)]
*  inadequate, has plummeted by two-thirds. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=138.48s)]
*  Excellencies, in the face of this calamity, the world has tried its best to save lives. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  And I want to express my gratitude to Egypt and Jordan for all their efforts. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=151.12s)]
*  Your Majesty, through you, allow me to thank the people of Jordan for the relief provided, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=157.92s)]
*  including through aid convoys, air drops and field hospitals. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=165.67999999999998s)]
*  We all appreciate immensely your personal commitment to mobilize the international community [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=171.2s)]
*  and your persistent call for a robust coordination mechanism for the unimpeded and safe flow [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=178.2s)]
*  of sufficient aid to the people of Gaza. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=185.2s)]
*  I urge the international community to support Jordan's efforts as it undertakes its critical [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=188.88s)]
*  role assisting the people of Gaza and serving as a key regional humanitarian hub. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=194.92s)]
*  President Al Sisi, I also want to commend your critical leadership and that of the government [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=201.92s)]
*  and people of Egypt, not only in supporting humanitarian relief to the people of Gaza [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=209.68s)]
*  in so many ways, but also for your pivotal role in seeking an end to this tragic conflict [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=215.28s)]
*  and building a foundation for sustainable peace. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=222.28s)]
*  And of course, we all salute the brave humanitarians in Gaza working in nightmare conditions to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=226.48s)]
*  stem the suffering. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=232.56s)]
*  Our Palestinian humanitarian colleagues in particular are working against enormous obstacles [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=235.44s)]
*  and near impossible conditions. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=241.24s)]
*  Imagine their lives and circumstances. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=244.72s)]
*  Showing up for work when their homes are destroyed and their loved ones killed. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=247.72s)]
*  Putting themselves in humanitarian convoys even when they have been fired upon. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=254.2s)]
*  Without those courageous individuals, the aid operations in Gaza would collapse. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=260.88s)]
*  And UNRWA is the backbone of this humanitarian response and it has suffered intolerably alongside [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=267.64s)]
*  the people it supports. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=275.12s)]
*  I express my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the 193 UNRWA staff members [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=278.12s)]
*  who have been killed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=285.96s)]
*  There must be full accountability for each and every one of these deaths. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=288.48s)]
*  Attacks on UN personnel and premises are unacceptable. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  Excellencies, the horror must stop. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  It's high time for a ceasefire along with the unconditional release of hostages. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=305.32s)]
*  I welcome the peace initiative recently outlined by President Biden and urge all parties to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqtn0rX3n3w&t=311.72s)]
