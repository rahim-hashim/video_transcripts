Video Description: Ambassadors from 123 member states today (17 Oct)expressed their support for the Palestine refugee agency (UNRWA) and their opposition to two bills before the Israeli parliament that could put a halt to its operations.

Jordanian Ambassador Mahmoud Daifallah Hmoud said UNRWA’s role “is indispensable and irreplaceable,” and is “the cornerstone and the backbone of humanitarian assistance to generations of Palestinian refugees through the provision of essential education, health relief and social services programs and emergency assistance in the occupied Palestinian territory, Jordan, Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic.”

Hmoud highlighted the findings of the independent review of UNRWA’s mechanisms and procedures to ensure its adherence to the humanitarian principles of neutrality led by Catherine Colonna, “and welcomed the Agency's commitment to fully implement its recommendations.”

Kuwaiti Ambassador Tareq AlBanai stressed “the serious humanitarian, political and security risks that would result from any interruption or suspension” of UNRWA’s “vital work.”

AlBanai reaffirmed “the shared commitments on UNWRA, which gathered universal support with 123 signatories to this date, and we remain committed to support the ability of the Agency to fulfil its vital mandate.”

Palestinian Ambassador Riyad Mansour for his part said, “UNRWA is indispensable. We will defend it. It will continue its mandate stemming from a mandate in the General Assembly until the rights of the Palestine refugees is fulfilled in the basis of resolution 194.”

UNRWA was established more than 70 years ago and supports Palestine refugees in five locations across the Middle East. The draft laws seek to evict the agency from its premises in territories under Israeli control and to revoke its privileges and immunities.

*  including the draft legislation before the Israeli parliament that could prevent Anruwa from carrying its [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=100.92s)]
*  and continuing its life saving operations and essential work in the occupied Palestinian territory [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=111.92s)]
*  including in the Gaza Strip where the situation is a humanitarian catastrophe and civilian sufferings and needs are immense [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=117.92s)]
*  Anruwa's role is indispensable and irreplaceable [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=126.92s)]
*  It is the cornerstone and the backbone of humanitarian assistance to generations of Palestinian refugees [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=130.92000000000002s)]

*  Please [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=173.92s)]
*  Anruwa is a pillar of regional stability and a lifeline of hope and opportunity for millions of Palestinian refugees it serves [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=175.92s)]
*  including children, women and youth [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=186.92s)]
*  and in this regard we stress serious humanitarian, political and security risks [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=190.92s)]
*  that would result from any interruption or suspension of its vital work [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=197.92s)]
*  We express our appreciation and admiration for the work of the staff of the agency in all fields of operation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=203.92s)]
*  and fulfillment of the agency's mandate and respect for the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=211.92s)]
*  We reaffirm the shared commitments on Anruwa which gathered universal support with 123 signatories to the state [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=221.92s)]
*  and we remain committed to support the ability of the agency to fulfill its vital mandate [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=232.92s)]
*  Thank you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=240.92s)]
*  Ambassador Mansour, any reaction to the killing of Mr. Sinwar and can this bring an end to the war? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=243.92s)]
*  We are here as you see more than 100 ambassadors to defend Anruwa [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=250.92s)]
*  and we are so grateful to Slovenia, to Kuwait, to Jordan, to the European Union [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=258.91999999999996s)]
*  and all the ambassadors who are here sending a very powerful message that Anruwa is indispensable [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=268.92s)]
*  We will defend it, it will continue its mandate stemming from a mandate in the General Assembly [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=276.92s)]
*  until the rights of the Palestinian refugees is fulfilled in the basis of Resolution 194 [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=284.92s)]
*  This moment is the moment of Anruwa, look at this massive message [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=290.92s)]
*  Look at it closely, almost everyone, a member of the United Nations is defending Anruwa [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=295.92s)]
*  and we hope that we succeed, I am sure we will succeed in defending Anruwa [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=304.92s)]
*  and the noble work that they do in the service of about 6 million Palestinian refugees [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=310.92s)]
*  We are grateful to all of you, Palestinian refugees are thankful to all of you [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=317.92s)]
*  and Anruwa is the best successful story of multilateralism of the United Nations [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=323.92s)]
*  We salute it, we respect it and we will defend it, thank you [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=331.92s)]
*  Thank you, if there is any questions we are happy to answer [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=344.92s)]
*  Either me or my brother Tariq from Kuwait or from Slovenia [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=348.92s)]
*  Do you expect the killing of Mr. Sinwar that written any change to the board? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=353.92s)]
*  Again as Ambassador Mansour said we are here to discuss Anruwa [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=361.92s)]
*  This issue is not the one we are coming to discuss here [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=367.92s)]
*  and in Jordan's national capacity I would like to condemn all Israeli measures [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=373.92s)]
*  that took place against Anruwa over not only the past one year [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=378.92s)]
*  but over decades by which Israel tried to destroy Anruwa, undermine its mandate [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=384.92s)]
*  and what it presents as a lifeline for the Palestinian refugees [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=392.92s)]
*  wherever they are in the areas of operation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=397.92s)]
*  and we see that the current measures that Israel is implementing [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=401.92s)]
*  which is systematically applying against Anruwa seeks to do two things [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=405.92s)]
*  end Anruwa's mandate first and cause the Palestinians to suffer further and further [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=411.92s)]
*  especially in Gaza and if linked damage to them, to their societies in Gaza [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=417.92s)]
*  and of course in the West Bank at a later stage so that Palestine will be empty of its people [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=423.92s)]
*  Ambassador, is there any more that can be done to bring accountability for Israel's crimes [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=430.92s)]
*  of killing the Anruwa staff members who tragically died, have been killed by Israel over the last year? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=435.92s)]
*  Of course, there is criminal accountability and legal responsibility both on Israel [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=441.92s)]
*  and its military and political leaders for this [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=447.92s)]
*  These are acts which are violations of international and military law and war crimes [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=451.92s)]
*  and they should be prosecuted in jurisdictions where states do have jurisdiction [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=457.92s)]
*  as well as in other judicial forums like the ICC [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=464.92s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, I'm sorry if I missed this [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=468.92s)]
*  but did you circulate some kind of a statement and ask countries to sign on to support Anruwa [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=471.92s)]
*  and if so, how many countries signed on? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=480.92s)]
*  No, we don't have a document, we just agreed that 123 states to appear before you today [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=483.92s)]
*  to reiterate our support to Anruwa as the body which is defending and protecting [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=491.92s)]
*  the Palestinian refugees' rights and providing necessary assistance [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=500.92s)]
*  I have one other question in light of the death of Mr. Sinwar [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=505.92s)]
*  Do you expect any change in the treatment of Anruwa staff in Gaza by the Israeli authorities? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=513.9200000000001s)]
*  Again, we're not here to talk about Mr. Sinwar, we're talking about Anruwa and its mandate [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=528.92s)]
*  Thank you [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=535.92s)]
*  How do you expect that this message would be received by Israel? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=537.92s)]
*  123 countries but they would still probably continue with the measures that they've been taking against them? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=540.92s)]
*  Thank you, we will have further measures if this happens [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=547.92s)]
*  Thank you all, have a good afternoon [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=550.92s)]
*  Thank you [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaLeDgX-OZE&t=558.92s)]
