# Israel on Palestine & Lebanon - Security Council Media Stakeout | United Nations
**United Nations - Israel Palestine:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk)
*  Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=0.0s)]
*  Danny Dunon, will deliver a brief statement ahead of this afternoon's Security Council. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=7.0s)]
*  He will take your questions afterwards. If you are called to ask a question, please remember [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=11.0s)]
*  to state your name and your news outlet. Thank you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=15.0s)]
*  Good afternoon. I came here today to speak about the Palestinian Authority and their poor choice [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=22.0s)]
*  to embrace terror and violence rather than condemn it. I will elaborate about the PA poor, weak, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=29.0s)]
*  incompetent leadership when we have the discussion later on in the Security Council. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=36.0s)]
*  Regarding Lebanon, at this stage I cannot give any specific comments regarding the attack in Lebanon. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=43.0s)]
*  However, as the Prime Minister said in the General Assembly today, we will take all necessary actions [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=50.0s)]
*  to achieve our aim of returning our civilians to their homes in the north. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=57.0s)]
*  True to that word, the Israel Defense Forces conducted a precise attack on Hezbollah's central headquarters [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=63.0s)]
*  once the core of its terror operations, not anymore. They intentionally built under residential buildings in Beirut, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=71.0s)]
*  Hezbollah, they are cowards. They use the Lebanese civilians as human shields to deter retaliation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=81.0s)]
*  Since October 8th, Hezbollah has continuously attacked Israel with drones, rockets and missiles. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=89.0s)]
*  Despite nearly a year of Israeli warning to the world, nothing changed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=96.0s)]
*  Now, as any sovereign nation would, Israel is taking necessary steps to protect its people [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=103.0s)]
*  and ensure that Israeli families can live in peace and security, free from the shadow of terror. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=111.0s)]
*  Israel will continue to act decisively. We will not sit and wait for death to knock at our doors. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=118.0s)]
*  What happened on October 7th will never happen again. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=127.0s)]
*  No, we will rise, we will strike and we will hunt down those who plot against us. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=132.0s)]
*  We have sent a clear message to every terrorist leader and every organization bent on our destruction. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=139.0s)]
*  Israel will not wait for terror to come to our doorstep. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=146.0s)]
*  We will come to them first and we will eliminate them. Thank you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=151.0s)]
*  Ambassador, it's Pamela Falk from US News and World Report. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=157.0s)]
*  Can you tell us anything about the proposal for a 21-day ceasefire? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=163.0s)]
*  The Prime Minister did not mention it. Is it still on the table? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=169.0s)]
*  And is there anything about the Lebanon bombing that you can tell us who was in the building? Thank you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=173.0s)]
*  First of all, we appreciate the efforts of those who are trying diplomacy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=181.0s)]
*  As we said earlier, if we can achieve the goals of the world through diplomacy, we prefer that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=186.0s)]
*  And the goals are to allow the citizens of Israel, 70,000 refugees, to move back to their homes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=192.0s)]
*  and to push Hezbollah from the southern Lebanon area according to Resolution 1701. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=199.0s)]
*  If there will be a similar agreement or proposal, we will accept it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=206.0s)]
*  And your second question, Pamela? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=212.0s)]
*  Can you fill us in on any details of who might have been in the building? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=215.0s)]
*  At this stage, I can say only that. It was a meeting of bad people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=221.0s)]
*  Bad people coming together, plotting another attacks against Israel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=226.0s)]
*  So we made sure they would not be able to do it anymore. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=232.0s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, Margaret from Voice of America. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=235.0s)]
*  You've been saying the last couple of days that you have evidence that Hezbollah was planning an October 7-style attack against Israel. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=239.0s)]
*  Could you elaborate on that? Because you've given us no details. Thank you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=246.0s)]
*  Well, I cannot give you all the details, but I would say that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=250.0s)]
*  We know that the Radwan forces of Hezbollah were plotting and practicing to have similar attacks entering northern communities in Israel, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=253.0s)]
*  kidnapping Israelis, and it's very similar. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=264.0s)]
*  And actually, I think they were caught by surprise also by the attack of Hamas, because they were talking about it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=268.0s)]
*  They were practicing it, and we have evidence for that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=274.0s)]
*  But Hamas, unfortunately, caught us by surprise. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=278.0s)]
*  But we have that information of their ideas to commit similar crimes that will involve kidnapping Israelis from Israel into Lebanon. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=282.0s)]
*  Ambassador, this is Gabriel Lozando from Al Jazeera English over here. Ambassador, thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=291.0s)]
*  Gabriel Lozando from Al Jazeera English, thank you for the question. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=296.0s)]
*  Thank you. Were you targeting Hasran Nazarallah? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=299.0s)]
*  When I said that it was a meeting of bad actors, Nazarallah is a bad actor. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=303.0s)]
*  He's a terrorist. He has the blood on his hands for many Americans, thousands of Israelis. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=308.0s)]
*  So I think he should be punished for that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=315.0s)]
*  I cannot confirm now whether he was in that meeting or not, but when I speak about bad actors, he's one of them. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=320.0s)]
*  Ambassador, just one quick question. Do you have any updates on the second phase of the polio campaign in Gaza? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=327.0s)]
*  Will Israel agree to do that? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=337.0s)]
*  We are moving ahead. We are working very closely with WHO and UNICEF. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=340.0s)]
*  I think it's a good example of cooperation between UN agencies that want to deal with professional projects and not advocacy against Israel like UNWA Gaza, for example. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=345.0s)]
*  We will continue to work and collaborate between COGAT and those NGOs in order to complete this project. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=356.0s)]
*  What about UNWA? UNWA? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=364.0s)]
*  I mentioned earlier, UNWA is busier more in dashing Israel and inciting against Israel rather than supporting humanitarian efforts in Gaza. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=366.0s)]
*  Ambassador, can you ask who ordered the bombing? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=376.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel said there is no place in Iran that Israel cannot reach. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=379.0s)]
*  The Biden administration has been saying for months that they don't want this to escalate into other parts of the region. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=386.0s)]
*  The question is, is Israel comfortable hitting anywhere in Iran without getting help from the United States? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=392.0s)]
*  No, so I think the Prime Minister said it differently. He said if we will be attacked, we will strike back. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=400.0s)]
*  That's the equation he put very directly. We have no intention to start an attack. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=407.0s)]
*  But if somebody will attack us, we have the capabilities, we have the technology to attack back, and we have proved it in the past. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=413.0s)]
*  We'll take maybe one last question because I know the Minister... [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=420.0s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=424.0s)]
*  Ambassador, are you at war with Lebanon? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=425.0s)]
*  Are you going to declare war through this country? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=434.0s)]
*  You are bombing its capital. Usually, when a country bombs the capital of another country, it's at war. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=439.0s)]
*  Let's start with the facts. October 8th, while we were still counting the bodies, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=448.0s)]
*  and we were fighting Hamas terrorists in the south and collecting the leftover of entire families, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=454.0s)]
*  Hezbollah, which is part of the Lebanese government, which is in control of southern Lebanon, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=461.0s)]
*  started to launch rockets and missiles against Israel. Unprovoked attack. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=466.0s)]
*  They are the ones who started, and they are... [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=471.0s)]
*  Unprovoked? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=473.0s)]
*  Yes, it was an unprovoked attack on October 8th. We had no conflict with Lebanon. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=474.0s)]
*  Hezbollah decided to show solidarity with Hamas, and Nasrallah said it himself. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=478.0s)]
*  And since then, almost a year now, they are sending rockets, drones against Israel. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=484.0s)]
*  So we retaliate. So I think that question should be asked. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=490.0s)]
*  I don't know if you can ask anything in Lebanon today, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=493.0s)]
*  but I call to the Lebanese people to speak up and to pressure Hezbollah [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=496.0s)]
*  and not allow Hezbollah to drag Lebanon to another war against Israel. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=501.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8HYP17ltGk&t=507.0s)]
