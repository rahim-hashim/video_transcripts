# Trump tests Republican Party willingness to follow him into fascism
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs)
*  Tonight, here's the headline in the New York Times. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=0.0s)]
*  Quote, accused of echoing fascists, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=3.84s)]
*  Trump campaign warns its critics will be, quote, crushed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=6.84s)]
*  Accused of echoing fascists? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=11.84s)]
*  I mean, you either are echoing fascists or you aren't. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=14.24s)]
*  Despite the sort of pulling the punch element of that headline, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  the subheadline on that story tonight in the New York Times [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=22.68s)]
*  does get there a little more directly. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=25.28s)]
*  The subhead says, quote, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=27.08s)]
*  the former president likened political opponents to vermin, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=29.28s)]
*  similar to the dehumanizing rhetoric [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=33.68s)]
*  wielded by dictators like Hitler and Mussolini. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=35.84s)]
*  The Washington Post headline just got there more directly. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=39.44s)]
*  Headline, Trump calls political enemies vermin, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=42.12s)]
*  echoing dictators Hitler and Mussolini. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=44.68s)]
*  The quote from Trump was this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=47.92s)]
*  He said, quote, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=49.32s)]
*  We will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=50.32s)]
*  and radical left thugs that live like vermin [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  within the confines of our country, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=56.24s)]
*  lie, steal, and cheat on elections, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=57.92s)]
*  and will do anything possible, whether legally or illegally, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=59.52s)]
*  to destroy America and the American dream. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=62.84s)]
*  The threat from outside forces is far less sinister, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=65.72s)]
*  dangerous, and grave than the threat from within. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  The threat from within, the vermin. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=72.84s)]
*  The former president made these comments [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=77.04s)]
*  in a Veterans Day speech. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  They did not appear to be ad-libbed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=79.64s)]
*  They appeared to have been written as part of the speech [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  in something he read off his teleprompter [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=83.44s)]
*  by all appearances. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=86.44s)]
*  Even if by some chance they weren't in the teleprompter [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  for that speech, he certainly made clear [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=91.16s)]
*  that he meant them for sure, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  and he meant them just like that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  when he put them in writing in a social media post [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=95.64s)]
*  that used the exact same language, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=97.96s)]
*  that used that same word vermin [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=99.84s)]
*  after he delivered the speech in New Hampshire. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=101.84s)]
*  And this is not subtle, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=107.52s)]
*  Everybody knows what this means. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=110.0s)]
*  You know, one thing about mass murdering dictators in history, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=111.6s)]
*  it's that they refer to the people they want to mass murder [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=115.32s)]
*  as vermin, pests, rats, insects, termites, right? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=117.6s)]
*  Anything to make their followers see those people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=120.8s)]
*  as something to be exterminated, not someone you might know. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  Professor Ruth Ben-Giott, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=130.0s)]
*  who's the author of the book Strongmen, said today, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=131.16s)]
*  all of this is part of his effort to re-educate Americans [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=133.56s)]
*  to see violence as justified, patriotic, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=136.88s)]
*  and even morally righteous. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  But to get people to lose their aversion to violence, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  savvy authoritarians also dehumanize their enemies. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  That is what Trump is doing, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  trying to get people to lose their aversion, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=152.16s)]
*  their natural aversion to violence. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=154.48s)]
*  And this comes at a time when the Washington Post, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  of course, has recently reported [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=161.2s)]
*  that Trump's advisers are working on a plan [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=162.64s)]
*  to invoke the Insurrection Act on his first day in office, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=164.88s)]
*  which would give him the power [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=167.56s)]
*  that the pro-Trump paramilitaries were calling for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=169.56s)]
*  ahead of January 6th, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=171.84s)]
*  and give him the power from day one [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=173.2s)]
*  to use the US military, the US Army, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=174.88s)]
*  against American civilians on US streets. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=177.72s)]
*  It comes at a time when the New York Times [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=180.48s)]
*  is newly reporting, as of this weekend, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=182.36s)]
*  that Trump's advisers are planning to build camps [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=184.6s)]
*  in the United States, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  camps capable of holding millions of people [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=188.76s)]
*  once he is back in office. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=191.6s)]
*  They plan to put millions of people in camps [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=193.84s)]
*  in the United States, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=196.84s)]
*  and they plan to do it using the military [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=198.8s)]
*  rather than by passing some new legislation [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=201.28s)]
*  that might make it seem legal. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=203.44s)]
*  They plan to just do it unilaterally, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  again, using the military, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=208.72s)]
*  building camps to hold millions of people, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=210.52s)]
*  using military force against your own people, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=213.0s)]
*  saying your political opponents are vermin [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=215.4s)]
*  who must be rooted out and crushed to save the country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=217.72s)]
*  None of this is subtle. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=222.24s)]
*  And apparently none of this is an accident. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=224.76s)]
*  These things aren't being blurted out accidentally, right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=226.48s)]
*  They're in the speech. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  They're in the social media posts. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=230.76s)]
*  These supposed plans for the new administration [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=232.84s)]
*  are being technically leaked. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=235.16s)]
*  I mean, as of tonight, the Trump campaign [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=237.32s)]
*  put out a statement officially disavowing [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=239.12s)]
*  all reported plans. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  But these supposed leaks are also accompanied [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=243.56s)]
*  in many instances by on-the-record interviews [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  with some of Trump's most senior advisers, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=249.72s)]
*  people putting their name to it [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=251.64s)]
*  and explicitly confirming these plans. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=253.2s)]
*  And just again, to be clear, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=257.44s)]
*  this talk about exterminating the vermin in this country [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=259.48s)]
*  was not an ad lib. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=262.72s)]
*  It's a repeated line now. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=263.92s)]
*  He wants to be known for this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  He wants everybody to know [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  that this is the language he is using. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=267.72s)]
*  And the fact that it's all happening at once, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=269.12s)]
*  the reporting on the camps they're gonna put people in, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=271.04s)]
*  the military force against civilians, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=273.36s)]
*  the vermin speech and all the statements about it, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  the fact that it is all happening at once [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=277.6s)]
*  presumably means it is not an accident, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=279.32s)]
*  that they are rolling this out now on purpose. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  Because why? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=283.6s)]
*  Because it's exciting to his followers, right? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=287.12s)]
*  The transgressive thrill of yet more lines being crossed, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=289.16s)]
*  more people being shocked and scared [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=293.24s)]
*  and insulted and offended. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=295.8s)]
*  That's the transgressive thrill of Trump's radicalism. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=297.48s)]
*  Yes, it's an effort to intimidate his opponents, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=302.16s)]
*  but also to excite his followers, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=304.72s)]
*  especially as he really does seem to be trying [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  to get them excited about the possibility [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=308.36s)]
*  of cathartic violence against Trump's enemies. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=311.12s)]
*  And he knows he's gonna get called a fascist [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  for talking this way, for proposing things like this. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=318.88s)]
*  He's inviting it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=323.64000000000004s)]
*  And he's calling all of his opponents fascists too, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  trying to rob that word of its meaning. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=328.48s)]
*  Call me a fascist and then I'll call you a fascist [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  and then that word will become something [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  that we throw around and it doesn't actually attach [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  to anything real and will thereby rob it of its power. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=336.68s)]
*  Sure, call me a fascist. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=342.48s)]
*  I'll call you a fascist too. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's where we are. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=347.12s)]
*  And so here's the question. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=349.04s)]
*  What is the institution in our country [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  that is going to find that intolerable [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=355.44s)]
*  and that is going to see this as something [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=357.96s)]
*  that's happening on its patch, which it needs to fix? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=359.48s)]
*  What is the institution that's going to feel the need [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  to self-police when it comes to somebody speaking [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=365.68s)]
*  on their behalf like this, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=368.8s)]
*  espousing these kinds of things, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=370.6s)]
*  There's no church here to shut down a Father Coughlin [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=372.32s)]
*  or a Bishop Strickland in Texas. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=376.04s)]
*  There's no judiciary to launch an ethics inquiry [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=378.0s)]
*  like you might have a judge. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=381.6s)]
*  There's no criminal law springing into action here. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=383.16s)]
*  As Americans, we of course have the constitutional right [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=385.76000000000005s)]
*  to espouse and say even the worst political ideas [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  without committing a crime by doing so. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=391.16s)]
*  There's no bar association to yank his law license. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=393.56s)]
*  There's no radio or TV network to say, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=397.32000000000005s)]
*  we're not hosting your show anymore. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  What is the institution here that decides [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=402.12s)]
*  this is on their patch? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=404.6s)]
*  What is the institution here that decides [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=406.8s)]
*  that you can never espouse things like this [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=408.6s)]
*  and also be part of them and also represent them? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=411.0s)]
*  There is only one. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=416.6s)]
*  It's his political party, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=421.8s)]
*  which when he is running to be the Republican nominee [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=424.6s)]
*  for President of the United States, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=427.48s)]
*  means that he's contending to leave that party. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=430.04s)]
*  While promising that he will build camps [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=433.4s)]
*  to hold millions of people in this country [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=435.4s)]
*  and he will use the military [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=437.4s)]
*  against American civilians at home in America [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=438.44s)]
*  and his political opponents are vermin [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=440.4s)]
*  who will be crushed and exterminated. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=442.4s)]
*  That is the test here. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=446.4s)]
*  That is the only, he's not running as an independent. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=447.4s)]
*  He's not running as the Trump for President candidate. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=449.4s)]
*  He is running as the Republican. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=451.4s)]
*  He wants to be the Republican nominee for President. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=453.4s)]
*  And so that is the only institution. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=456.0s)]
*  That is the institution that is being tested here. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=458.4s)]
*  This is him testing the political party [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=461.0s)]
*  that he says he's going to lead. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=463.0s)]
*  Testing them now, one year out from the election, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=465.0s)]
*  to see what they will tolerate as an institution. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=467.0s)]
*  Which means every single member of that party [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=472.0s)]
*  will now have to answer whether this is who they are, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=474.0s)]
*  whether this is what they stand for, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=476.0s)]
*  whether this is the cause of their party. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=478.0s)]
*  We know from history that a country under threat [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=481.0s)]
*  does not stand up for itself amorphously [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=483.0s)]
*  with some sort of inchoate civic objection [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=486.0s)]
*  that just redounds to the population at large. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=489.0s)]
*  It works that way like in fiction and poetry. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=491.0s)]
*  In real life, a country under threat stands up for itself [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=493.0s)]
*  when the institutions that make up the civic [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=496.0s)]
*  and political life of that country [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=498.0s)]
*  stand up and say what they are for [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=500.0s)]
*  and what they can no longer stand. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=502.0s)]
*  There is only one institution in this country [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=504.0s)]
*  that is implicated by what he is doing. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=506.0s)]
*  And he is testing them. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=509.0s)]
*  And that is the point where we are now. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=510.0s)]
*  He has forced it there. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=512.0s)]
*  What now? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=516.0s)]
*  What now? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjdgZ-7ZMs&t=517.0s)]
