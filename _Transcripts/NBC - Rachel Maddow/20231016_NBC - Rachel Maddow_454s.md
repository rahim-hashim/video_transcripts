Video Description: Richard Engel, NBC News chief foreign correspondent, talks with Rachel Maddow about a new statement from Hamas that appears to entertain the possibility of releasing hostages who are dual-nationals or foreigner, depending on a difficult to discern "field conditions" standard. While not a guarantee of anything, any movement at all in the hostage situation is seen as significant.

# Glimmer of hope as Hamas broaches subject of releasing some hostages
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI)
*  There's also news tonight first broken on our air by Richard Engel that Hamas is now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=0.0s)]
*  stating that it has between 200 and 250 hostages in Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=6.26s)]
*  Hamas also releasing a statement that they are looking to release some of the people [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=12.08s)]
*  who they took hostage, people they describe as foreign nationals, who they say are being [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=16.38s)]
*  held not as hostages but as their guests. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  They say they are looking to release them when field conditions permit their release. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=24.82s)]
*  We don't know what that means but this is an important advance at least in the story [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=30.78s)]
*  of what has become of these again 200 maybe more people who are being held by Hamas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=34.94s)]
*  NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel tonight is reporting from near the Israel-Gaza [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=39.82s)]
*  border. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=44.22s)]
*  Richard, I'm happy to lay eyes on you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=45.22s)]
*  Thanks for staying up to join us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=47.54s)]
*  What do you make of the statement from Hamas? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=49.82s)]
*  Why they're doing it? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=51.86s)]
*  What do you think it means? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=52.86s)]
*  Well, I think it's very significant, Rachel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=53.9s)]
*  I think it means that there's movement on this issue after hearing nothing from Hamas. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=58.98s)]
*  Hamas said that it is holding 200 hostages. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=64.9s)]
*  It said that other groups, however, in the Gaza Strip are holding more hostages. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=69.22s)]
*  So they're talking about Hamas with 200, the military wing of Hamas, and then another 50 [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=73.78s)]
*  more, according to the spokesman of Hamas, inside the Gaza Strip total. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=79.94000000000001s)]
*  And among those 200 that Hamas says it is holding, it says there are an unspecified [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=85.78s)]
*  number of foreign nationals and that it is willing to hand them over, that it wants to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=91.94000000000001s)]
*  hand them over, that it doesn't believe that they are party to this conflict and that it [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=97.0s)]
*  has no issue with them and it will hand them over when the conditions are right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  As you said, what does it mean when the conditions are right? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=109.7s)]
*  But also a few hours ago, just slightly before Hamas issued that statement, Iran's foreign [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=113.42s)]
*  minister said that Hamas is expressing a willingness to release hostages when Israel or if Israel [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=119.46s)]
*  stops its airstrikes into Gaza. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  So we're hearing similar messages both from Iran and from Hamas about releasing hostages, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=129.54s)]
*  talking about field conditions at the same time. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=137.34s)]
*  So there is movement on this issue. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=139.9s)]
*  The issue is, however, they're only talking about those hostages who are dual nationals [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=142.54s)]
*  or foreigners. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  And they also said that any of people who were taken, any hostages that were taken that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=150.06s)]
*  were fighting, even if they are Americans or French or they didn't mention nationalities, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=155.78s)]
*  but foreign nationals, but were serving in the Israeli military or serving in a fighting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=160.74s)]
*  capacity, they wouldn't be considered for this arrangement. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=166.42s)]
*  They would be considered combatants and they would be treated like Israelis. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=170.38s)]
*  So it seems what Hamas is trying to do is create a division, create a wedge to say that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  its fight is with Israel and Israel alone and not with the United States, not with the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=181.1s)]
*  rest of the world. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=187.7s)]
*  And this comes amid a lot of international diplomacy, a lot of efforts by the United [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=189.14s)]
*  States and other countries and its allies to try and get movement on this issue and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=194.58s)]
*  to try and get those hostages out, hopefully, just as a start. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=199.98s)]
*  And Richard, I don't want to get too far ahead of the story or to imagine sort of too much [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=205.7s)]
*  nitty gritty here that we can't get at. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=209.9s)]
*  But it seems to me like even if they are trying to establish some sort of divide between different [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=211.74s)]
*  types of hostages, the release of any hostages is both good for those people who could then [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=216.62s)]
*  potentially be saved, but also potentially strategically important for getting all or [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=223.17999999999998s)]
*  more or potentially all of the hostages out, because presumably the people released could [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=228.66s)]
*  help in terms of finding the rest of them, couldn't they? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  You take the yes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  If Hamas is willing to give up hostages and not asking for any specific thing in return [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  except for potentially just a temporary halt in the bombings, we don't know exactly what [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  Hamas is asking for. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=257.3s)]
*  We're not party to those conversations between Hamas and different negotiators. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=259.74s)]
*  But what they're publicly asking and what Iran is also suggesting is they're talking [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=266.34s)]
*  about a stop of the airstrikes. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=270.7s)]
*  Then yes, get those people out and then see what they know, see where they were taken. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  What is the mentality? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=279.06s)]
*  How are they being treated? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=280.06s)]
*  What do they know about the other hostages? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=281.42s)]
*  Absolutely, they could lead to to more intelligence, more leads and and provide tremendous relief [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=283.3s)]
*  to the hostages themselves who may be injured, absolutely terrified and their families. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=290.3s)]
*  I was hostage myself in the Middle East, not by Hamas, but by another group. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=296.46s)]
*  And I can tell you the amount of stress that it puts on the people who are taken and their [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=301.42s)]
*  families. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=305.5s)]
*  Absolutely, it would be good for them and potentially good for the rest. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=306.9s)]
*  And Richard, I was I was interested to hear you say that you were in touch with people [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=310.98s)]
*  involved in a number of Arab countries who have been working on trying to negotiate something, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=315.82s)]
*  trying to make some contact, some progress on the hostage issue. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=320.18s)]
*  We heard from a hostages family member today about having been contacted by people in touch [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=324.7s)]
*  with the Red Cross and other other non-profit NGO groups that are trying to work on this [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=328.66s)]
*  issue. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=334.62s)]
*  Do you sense that, I mean, from what you're hearing from Israeli officials and American [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=335.74s)]
*  officials and other people in the region, do you think this is a live thing that's being [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=339.26s)]
*  worked on right now? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=343.58s)]
*  Is this something that there's it's not just, you know, individual forays and individual [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=344.98s)]
*  statements, but there's actual person to person negotiation happening here and that we might [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=349.38s)]
*  get movement soon? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=354.26s)]
*  Yes, there is motion on this and there are contacts that are happening and they are happening [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=356.26s)]
*  in real time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=364.53999999999996s)]
*  That is that is certainly the case. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=367.41999999999996s)]
*  There is a lot of effort focused on this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=369.06s)]
*  There is effort focused on this around the world. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=371.73999999999995s)]
*  I don't believe this statement was issued in isolation, that it was something that Hamas [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=375.06s)]
*  just threw out there. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=379.82s)]
*  This is a concerted international effort and I believe it's the result of some diplomacy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=382.7s)]
*  Now what will happen with it? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=387.58s)]
*  Will it come true? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=389.47999999999996s)]
*  There's so much that can go wrong here. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=391.34s)]
*  This is still an active war zone. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=393.06s)]
*  You can hear where I am right now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=396.06s)]
*  There's the loud buzzing of Israeli drones overhead. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=397.9s)]
*  We have been hearing some continued strikes into Gaza. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=401.94s)]
*  So there is an opening. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=405.09999999999997s)]
*  There is movement here, but there is there is no guarantee of success at this stage. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=407.38s)]
*  But to go back to your original question, was this the result of some concerted international [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=412.21999999999997s)]
*  effort? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=417.82s)]
*  I believe it was. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=418.82s)]
*  Richard Engel, chief foreign correspondent for NBC News. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=420.22s)]
*  Richard, you are never allowed to be taken hostage again and you must stay safe. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=422.86s)]
*  All of us aged many decades over those times over those days that you were gone, my friend. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=427.14000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVOjyzoQsPI&t=432.34000000000003s)]
