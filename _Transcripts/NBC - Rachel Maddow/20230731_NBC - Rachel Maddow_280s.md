Video Description: Many Americans reflexively express dissatisfaction with the federal government without regard for the specifics of what the government or its constituent parts may be doing. But as Rachel Maddow reports, a new poll suggests how Americans really feel about the state of affairs in the United States and why that's good news for Joe Biden.

# Secret public sentiment exposed in new poll explains weak GOP presidential field
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q)
*  Morning Consult recently did a public approval poll in all 50 states. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  And it was public approval polling in all 50 states about the governors of all 50 states. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=6.88s)]
*  And this generated a bunch of local headlines, state headlines, that you'd expect. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  Most of those headlines were about, like, the relative standing of the most and least [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=17.92s)]
*  popular governors in the country. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=21.62s)]
*  And for governors who were up for reelection, this Morning Consult polling helped various [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=23.32s)]
*  local publications get a handle on whether that governor's approval rating was going [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=29.26s)]
*  up or going down with voters as they head toward trying to hold onto their seat next [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=33.5s)]
*  year. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=37.82s)]
*  That kind of local interest and state interest stuff. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=38.82s)]
*  Here's my interest, though. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=40.86s)]
*  Look at this stuff overall. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  However interested you might be in who's slightly more or less popular among the governors, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=44.58s)]
*  there is one big overarching story here, which is that all of the governors are popular. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=49.74s)]
*  All of them in all 50 states. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=57.58s)]
*  There is not a single governor in any state in the country right now who has a higher [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=59.86s)]
*  disapproval than approval rating. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=63.96s)]
*  Not a single governor in the entire country is underwater. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=67.46s)]
*  They're all more positively viewed by their constituents than they are negatively viewed. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=70.6s)]
*  And again, you can maybe tell a story of local interest about any one governor who finds [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=77.58s)]
*  himself or herself in that position. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=81.88s)]
*  But when it's all 50 governors who are in that position, that's a bigger story. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=84.14s)]
*  That's a national story hiding in plain sight, which is that Americans, broadly, are not [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=88.98s)]
*  that unhappy with how things are being run right now. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=96.66s)]
*  And yes, you ask people about national political figures and national political institutions, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  and Americans say, like, basically, broadly, Americans say, oh yeah, I hate them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=107.38s)]
*  I hate the Congress. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=113.42s)]
*  I hate the Supreme Court. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=114.42s)]
*  I don't like the president. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=115.42s)]
*  And honestly, Americans, unless they're kind of culty about it, they don't really like [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=116.42s)]
*  any of the other presidential candidates who want to run against the president either. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=120.42s)]
*  So if you ask about, like, how things are going governance-wise, nationally, people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=125.32s)]
*  are like, oh, I'm sure that things are absolutely terrible. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  But if you ask Americans about something that doesn't really have national political conversation [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=131.68s)]
*  around it, if you ask, hey, how are things actually running government-wise as you see [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=136.24s)]
*  it, more or less the answer in every state in the country is, yeah, things are OK. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=141.9s)]
*  Everybody's pretty happy. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=149.78s)]
*  Everybody's at least more happy than not in all 50 states. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=151.26s)]
*  Every single governor in the country is above water. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  And if you put a political science lens on that so that you stop trying to parse that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=160.74s)]
*  in terms of the individual performance of each of those 50 governors, if you put a political [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=164.94s)]
*  science lens on that, it basically means if you strip away nationalized partisan political [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=169.38s)]
*  combat and nationalized partisan tribalism, the fundamentals in the country, as viewed [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=175.9s)]
*  by the American people, are pretty good. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=182.42s)]
*  And the fundamentals are almost always about the economy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=185.1s)]
*  So yeah, you look at that chart of every governor in America being above water. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=190.06s)]
*  Maybe what that has something to do with is the beating all expectations, economic growth [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=195.06s)]
*  and personal income rising and inflation flattening out and an infrastructure surge and record [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=200.5s)]
*  job growth and the lowest sustained unemployment we have had in decades. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=206.9s)]
*  And no one apparently wants to credit Joe Biden and the Biden administration for that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=213.02s)]
*  So they credit their governor. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=218.84s)]
*  They credit the governor in each of the 50 states. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=221.54s)]
*  But that's OK. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=228.78s)]
*  You know, we can read. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=229.78s)]
*  We know basic political science. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=230.78s)]
*  We also know basic polling, where if the country really was over President Joe Biden and really [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=233.64s)]
*  wanted him out of there and everybody was really ready for somebody new, then the opposing [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=239.38s)]
*  party Republicans would be falling all over themselves to ride that train, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=244.82s)]
*  To become one of the immensely popular candidates ready to take on this unpopular president, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=249.9s)]
*  Joe Biden, who everybody agrees is doing such a bad job, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  That is not what's happening. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnnAaCHkL1Q&t=259.14s)]
