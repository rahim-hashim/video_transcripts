# 'A six resignation kind of day' at DOJ following Trump's sketchy deal with NYC mayor Eric Adams
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4)
*  First, let's start with what's just happened at SDNY, Southern District of New York, the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=0.0s)]
*  federal prosecutor's office there. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  The New York Times was first to report on these developments today, and here's how they [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=5.84s)]
*  led their initial report. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=9.56s)]
*  Quote, Manhattan's U.S. attorney on Thursday resigned rather than obey an order from a [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  top Justice Department official to drop the corruption case against New York City's Mayor [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=16.22s)]
*  Eric Adams. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=21.6s)]
*  Then, when DOJ officials transferred the case to the public integrity section at Maine [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=22.8s)]
*  Justice in Washington, which oversees corruption cases, the two men who led that unit at Maine [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=27.9s)]
*  Justice, quote, also resigned. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=33.78s)]
*  NBC News' Ryan Reilly reports tonight that three additional officials in the public integrity [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=36.58s)]
*  section at Maine Justice also resigned after meeting the same top Justice Department official [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  who is Trump appointee and Trump defense counsel, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bové. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=48.42s)]
*  So if you're wondering what kind of day it's been thus far at the U.S. Department of Justice, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=55.98s)]
*  it's a six-resignation kind of day thus far. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=59.9s)]
*  But just to get the import here, just back up for a second. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=66.66s)]
*  The mayor of New York City is Eric Adams. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=69.34s)]
*  He's a Democrat. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=71.46s)]
*  He's elected in 2021. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  The people of New York who elected Adams largely on his tough-on-crime platform would soon [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=74.25999999999999s)]
*  federal prosecutors at SDNY in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=81.14s)]
*  federal prosecutors started investigating him in 2021, even before he took office, because [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=87.26s)]
*  they were looking into what appeared to be serious irregularities in his campaign fundraising. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=93.14s)]
*  And this past September, Eric Adams became the first sitting mayor of New York City to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=98.94s)]
*  ever be charged with federal crimes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=102.78s)]
*  He was indicted on a whole raft of charges involving allegedly fraudulent campaign contributions, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=104.9s)]
*  also a rip-snorting alleged bribery scheme in which he allegedly took campaign funds and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  gifts and luxury travel from agents of the government of Turkey in exchange for doing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=116.14s)]
*  favors for the government of Turkey. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  But the charges themselves were like pretty straightforward corruption charges, you know, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=126.14000000000001s)]
*  local politician charged with accepting money he's not legally allowed to accept. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=130.34s)]
*  And in some cases, he's charged with allegedly doing official favors in exchange for that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=134.78s)]
*  money. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=139.94s)]
*  Prosecutors at SDNY indicted Eric Adams in September. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=141.58s)]
*  Mayor Adams vowed to stay in office, vowed to fight the charges. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  He was given a trial date of this spring, April of this year, to have his day in court. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=148.62s)]
*  But then Donald Trump was sworn in as president, and this week, Donald Trump's Justice Department [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=156.06s)]
*  ordered the federal prosecutors at SDNY to drop their case against Adams, to drop the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=160.9s)]
*  charges, not because they said they had some new evidence vindicating Adams, but because [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  according to the new Trump appointees at Maine Justice, the mayor was the victim of a political [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=171.02s)]
*  persecution. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=177.02s)]
*  But here is something to note about the way they ordered the charges dropped against Mayor [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  Adams, and I don't think this has gotten enough attention. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=182.54000000000002s)]
*  In the memo from, you know, Donald Trump's personal lawyer, who's the acting deputy attorney [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=185.58s)]
*  general, Emil Boves, the Southern District prosecutors were told by him that they needed [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=191.06s)]
*  to dismiss the charges without prejudice, which is a legal term that means the charges [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=196.26000000000002s)]
*  could be brought later, could be brought back again at a later time. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  The charges against Eric Adams, quote, shall be reviewed by the confirmed U.S. attorney [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  in the Southern District of New York following the November 2025 mayoral election based on [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=211.1s)]
*  consideration of all relevant factors. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=217.5s)]
*  So we're putting these charges on ice for now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  So Eric Adams can run his reelection campaign without technically being under indictment, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=226.45999999999998s)]
*  and then we'll see how we feel. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=231.14s)]
*  And maybe we'll bring the charges back based on consideration of all the relevant factors. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  Talk about having leverage over somebody, right? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=240.26s)]
*  Prompted this headline from Josh Marshall at his news site, TPM, quote, Donald Trump [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=242.7s)]
*  is now the mayor of New York. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=247.98s)]
*  Quote, think what this means. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=249.82s)]
*  Adams isn't off the hook. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  He's essentially been given 10 months to perform for his freedom, to perform for Donald Trump. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=252.89999999999998s)]
*  And what might the Trump administration want from the mayor of America's largest city? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, from the Justice Department memo ordering SDNY to drop the charges, quote, the pending [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=264.14s)]
*  prosecution has unduly restricted the mayor's ability to devote full attention and resources [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=270.94s)]
*  to illegal immigration. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=276.73999999999995s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=278.41999999999996s)]
*  Sure, sure enough. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=280.5s)]
*  Got it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=282.7s)]
*  And sure enough, today, Eric Adams met with Donald Trump's point man on mass deportations [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=284.9s)]
*  and Mayor Adams promptly announced that he's going to start allowing federal immigration [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=291.1s)]
*  agents into the city's biggest jail complex, even though there is a city law explicitly [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=295.54s)]
*  against that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  Interesting how much he wants to please Donald Trump right now, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=304.9s)]
*  I wonder why that is. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=308.02s)]
*  But here's why today was a six-resignation day at the U.S. Justice Department. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=310.38s)]
*  Because even though the acting deputy attorney general, Trump's personal lawyer, Emil Beauvais, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=314.18s)]
*  ordered that the charges against Eric Adams had to be dropped, he ordered those charges [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=321.42s)]
*  to be dropped on Monday. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  We've been sort of watching all week wondering what's going to happen because here's Thursday [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=328.42s)]
*  and as of this morning, those charges still had not been dropped. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=332.46000000000004s)]
*  He ordered them dropped on Monday. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=335.14s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=336.94s)]
*  Well, the reason they hadn't been dropped is because SDNY said, no, we're not going [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=338.22s)]
*  to do it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=342.54s)]
*  The acting U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York said, talk to the hand. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=344.1s)]
*  Now this was somebody specifically chosen by Trump to fill this role until they got [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=350.42s)]
*  their own nominee confirmed. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=354.98s)]
*  She is a registered Republican. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=357.18s)]
*  She's a prosecutor with what the New York Times calls bulletproof conservative credentials. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=359.42s)]
*  She's in the Federalist Society. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=363.98s)]
*  She clerked for Scalia. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=365.54s)]
*  Well, when she was ordered by Maine Justice to drop the charges against Mayor Adams, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=368.38s)]
*  this acting U.S. attorney, her name is Danielle Sassoon, she wrote this remarkable memo to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=375.14s)]
*  Pam Bondi, Trump's newly confirmed attorney general. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=383.06s)]
*  She said, quote, I deem it necessary to the faithful discharge of my duties to raise the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=387.14s)]
*  concerns expressed in this letter with you and to request an opportunity to meet to discuss [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=391.21999999999997s)]
*  them further. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=395.02s)]
*  The reasons advanced by the acting deputy attorney general, Mr. Bovet, for dismissing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=396.18s)]
*  the indictment are not ones I can in good faith defend as in the public interest and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=400.5s)]
*  as consistent with the principles of impartiality and fairness that guide my decision making. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=405.86s)]
*  Mr. Bovet proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=410.9s)]
*  in enforcing federal immigration laws, analogizing to the prisoner exchange in which the U.S. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=415.46s)]
*  freed notorious Russian arms dealer Victor Bout in return for an American prisoner in [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=421.3s)]
*  Russia. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=426.5s)]
*  Such an exchange with Adams violates common sense beliefs in the Equal Administration [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=427.5s)]
*  of Justice, the Justice Manual and the Rules of Professional Conduct. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=433.06s)]
*  Adams has argued in substance and Mr. Bovet appears prepared to concede that the mayor [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=436.98s)]
*  should receive leniency for federal crimes solely because he occupies an important public [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=441.5s)]
*  and can use that position to assist in the administration's policy priorities. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=446.86s)]
*  In your words, and she's quoting Pam Bondi to herself here, quote, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=451.66s)]
*  Danielle Sassoon says then, quote, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=463.34000000000003s)]
*  An improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=476.1s)]
*  his case. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=479.98s)]
*  Although Mr. Bovet disclaimed any intention to exchange leniency in this case for Adams's [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=481.18s)]
*  assistance in enforcing federal law, that is the nature of the bargain laid bare in [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=486.06s)]
*  Mr. Bovet's memo. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=490.82000000000005s)]
*  That is especially so given Mr. Bovet's comparison to the Victor Bout prisoner exchange, which [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  was quite expressly a quid pro quo, but one carried out by the White House and not by [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=497.94s)]
*  the prosecutors in charge of Bout's case. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=502.36s)]
*  As Sassoon notes in her footnote here, and this is like actually maybe the most explosive [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=506.09999999999997s)]
*  thing in the entire thing. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=511.3s)]
*  This is a footnote. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=514.22s)]
*  She says, quote, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=515.22s)]
*  Meeting on January 31st, 2025 with Mr. Bovet, Mayor Adams's counsel and members of my office. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=516.22s)]
*  Mayor Adams's attorneys repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=522.6600000000001s)]
*  Adams would be in a position to assist with the department's enforcement priorities only [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=527.5s)]
*  if the indictment were dismissed. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=532.1800000000001s)]
*  Mr. Bovet admonished a member of my team who took notes during that meeting and directed [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=534.5s)]
*  the collection of those notes at the meeting's conclusion. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=541.38s)]
*  And finally, there's this, quote, As you know, our office is prepared to seek a superseding [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=546.22s)]
*  indictment from a new grand jury under my leadership. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=552.1s)]
*  We've proposed a superseding indictment that would add an obstruction conspiracy count [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=555.22s)]
*  based on evidence that Mayor Adams destroyed and instructed others to destroy evidence [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=559.34s)]
*  and provide false information to the FBI. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=564.1800000000001s)]
*  And that would add further factual allegations regarding his participation in a fraudulent [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=566.84s)]
*  straw donor scheme. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  So she's like, no, we're not dropping this. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=574.46s)]
*  Also, you want to talk about this quid pro quo thing and check my footnote in terms of [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=577.94s)]
*  your behavior here. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=583.98s)]
*  But also, we have another indictment of Eric Adams coming soon. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=585.1800000000001s)]
*  So it's not like just existing charges that are going to be put on ice. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=590.22s)]
*  You're going to have to put the upcoming charges on ice as well. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=593.46s)]
*  Danielle Sassoon ends the letter with this, quote, Because the law does not support a [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=598.38s)]
*  dismissal and because I'm confident that Adams has committed the crimes with which [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=601.66s)]
*  he's charged, I cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=605.1s)]
*  I understand my duty as a prosecutor to mean enforcing the law impartially, and that includes [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=609.6999999999999s)]
*  prosecuting a validly returned indictment, regardless of whether its dismissal would [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=615.14s)]
*  be politically advantageous to the defendant or to those who appointed me. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=619.42s)]
*  In the event you are unwilling to meet or to reconsider the directive in light of the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=624.74s)]
*  problems raised by Boves memo, I'm prepared to offer my resignation. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=628.3s)]
*  It has been and continues to be my honor to serve as a prosecutor in the Southern District [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=634.26s)]
*  of New York. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=638.8199999999999s)]
*  Very truly yours, Danielle R Sassoon, U.S. Attorney, Southern District of New York. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=639.8199999999999s)]
*  The hero is silent, but everybody could see it there. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=647.6999999999999s)]
*  Apparently, Pam Bondi declined to meet with Danielle Sassoon because today, Emile Boves [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=652.9799999999999s)]
*  sent a new letter to Danielle Sassoon saying, quote, Your resignation is accepted. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=657.38s)]
*  He also says that assistant prosecutors on the case are to be put on administrative leave [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=662.26s)]
*  immediately. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=666.86s)]
*  And he says the Mayor Adams case is going to be transferred to the Justice Department [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=667.86s)]
*  in D.C. because of her, quote, insubordination at SDNY. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=671.58s)]
*  But again, this did not go the way they intended. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=676.3000000000001s)]
*  Once they transferred the case to main justice, they ran into more problems when the top two [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=680.0600000000001s)]
*  officials overseeing the public integrity unit at main justice also promptly resigned. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=684.5799999999999s)]
*  They said, we're not doing it either. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=689.38s)]
*  They said we also will not go to court to ask the court to drop these charges against [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=692.3s)]
*  Mayor Adams. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=696.5s)]
*  The top two people in the department said that at main justice and then three more people [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=697.62s)]
*  in that department resigned as well. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=701.5s)]
*  So as of tonight, the Justice Department is down six prosecutors total and the charges [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=704.9s)]
*  against Eric Adams still have not been dropped. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrY1rSR1U4&t=710.42s)]
