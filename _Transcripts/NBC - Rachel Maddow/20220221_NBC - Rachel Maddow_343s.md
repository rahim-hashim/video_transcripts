# U.S. And Western Allies Weigh Options To Punish Russia For Putin's Ukraine Incursion
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8)
*  Joining me now is the retired United States Navy Admiral James Stavridis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=0.0s)]
*  He is the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=4.0s)]
*  He's MSNBC's Chief International Security and Diplomacy Analyst. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=7.0s)]
*  Admiral, thank you for being here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=11.0s)]
*  And I know you keep getting asked these questions over and over again. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=13.0s)]
*  But Vladimir Putin is playing three-dimensional chess here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=17.0s)]
*  We were expecting something different, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=21.0s)]
*  and he has declared these two regions to be independent nations for all intents and purposes [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=23.0s)]
*  and is moving forward with moving troops into Ukraine. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=29.0s)]
*  How do you see this? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=32.0s)]
*  I see it as an invasion. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=34.0s)]
*  You know, in addition to being Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=36.0s)]
*  I was, after that, the Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=39.0s)]
*  a leading graduate school of international relations and international law. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=46.0s)]
*  There's a definition for an invasion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=51.0s)]
*  It's the imposition of armed troops for political purpose [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=54.0s)]
*  into a sovereign country without the consent of that nation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=59.0s)]
*  Whether it's a squad of 12, a squadron of tanks, or an army of 190,000 isn't relevant. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=64.0s)]
*  This is an invasion. That's what's occurring. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=72.0s)]
*  We need to deal with it as such, and that means a significant package of response from the West, Ali. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=75.0s)]
*  A significant package of response from the West, and that, I assume, means two things. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=82.0s)]
*  I was talking to Ambassador McFaul earlier, sanctions and diplomacy, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=87.0s)]
*  and it means something to do with NATO, right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=93.0s)]
*  There are all these NATO countries. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=95.0s)]
*  I'll ask my control room to put the map up of what NATO looks like today. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=97.0s)]
*  There are a lot of NATO countries right around Ukraine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=101.0s)]
*  What are they planning to do? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=104.0s)]
*  I think there are three things that the alliance needs to do right now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=107.0s)]
*  Number one, you alluded to, is simply stand diplomatically, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=112.0s)]
*  go as an alliance in front of the United Nations, put the weight of this alliance, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=116.0s)]
*  30 nations representing 55 percent of the world's GDP, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=121.0s)]
*  three million men and women under arms, almost all volunteers, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=126.0s)]
*  an incredible, powerful alliance, put the diplomatic weight of that alliance behind Ukraine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=130.0s)]
*  Number two, perhaps more importantly, the sanctions package, and it needs to be overwhelming. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=137.0s)]
*  We need shock and awe economically. That's going to be hard. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=144.0s)]
*  Putin has spent a lot of time trying to kind of fireproof his economy, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=148.0s)]
*  but there are mechanisms to take Russia out of the swift system, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=152.0s)]
*  to go after individual oligarch fortunes, and above all, to go after oil and gas, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=157.0s)]
*  which is the beating heart of the Russian economy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=164.0s)]
*  And number three, Ali, really to the alliance, if Putin is going to fully continue this invasion, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=168.0s)]
*  expand it, move throughout the country, I think the logical response is going to be a resistance. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=176.0s)]
*  And you may see the Zelensky government have to leave Kiev and move to the far west, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=182.0s)]
*  to Lviv in the far west of Ukraine, or even form a government in exile and then run and resistance, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=189.0s)]
*  much like Charles de Gaulle did in France in the 1940s. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=198.0s)]
*  We need to facilitate that, arm it, train it, equip it, make this a very difficult move on the part of Putin. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=202.0s)]
*  So there's diplomacy, there's economics, there's a military response here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=210.0s)]
*  All of that can be, I hope, sufficient to deter Putin from further conquest in Ukraine. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=215.0s)]
*  So let's put that map up of Ukraine again, because I want to ask you something. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=223.0s)]
*  There is this theory that these are independent regions with a lot of Russian speakers who require the protection of the Russians. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=226.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of reporting about the fact that they are looking to take the government out in Kiev. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=234.0s)]
*  You were just talking about the fact that they might move Zelensky out and they may have to form a government in exile. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=239.0s)]
*  How likely do you think that this escalates beyond the eastern parts of Ukraine, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=245.0s)]
*  which have large Russian speaking populations, into the rest of Ukraine? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=250.0s)]
*  I think it is about a one in three chance, Ali, from where we sit tonight, that Putin will go full blitzkrieg, shock and awe, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=254.0s)]
*  take it to Kiev, one in three. I think it's a two in three chance that he will take a somewhat more conservative approach [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=266.0s)]
*  and really focus his forces on this region where there are admittedly many Russian speakers, ethnic Russians. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=274.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has done an airdrop of passports, handed out hundreds of thousands of Russian passports [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=282.0s)]
*  to Ukrainians who are sympathetic to Russia in this section. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=290.0s)]
*  So he'll try and build around that. But we need to not be fooled by that, not to be distracted by it. Ukraine has been invaded here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=295.0s)]
*  It requires the absolute full force of the response of the West. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=304.0s)]
*  You have made that point strongly today. Ambassador McFaul has made the same point, not to fall for some idea that something else has happened here, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=308.0s)]
*  just because it doesn't look like what you think an invasion looks like from the movies or TV. Ambassador, thanks for your time tonight, as always. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=315.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leu12EPrSr8&t=325.0s)]
