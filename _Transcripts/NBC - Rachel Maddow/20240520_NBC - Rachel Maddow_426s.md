# Republican efforts to sabotage Georgia prosecution of Trump hit brick wall with Fani Willis
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM)
*  Let me start by asking you about what your life has been like and how things have changed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=0.0s)]
*  over the course of this past year. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=9.6s)]
*  I know you have bodyguards. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=11.36s)]
*  I know you had to leave your home because of ongoing threats against you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=13.68s)]
*  I saw footage last week in an event honoring the South Fulton police. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=18.68s)]
*  You got a little bit emotional thanking the police for having kept you safe in what has [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=21.88s)]
*  been a remarkably threatening environment for you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=26.12s)]
*  I wondered what effect the sort of constant threat of violence that you've been living [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=30.72s)]
*  with has had on you and on your ability to do your work. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=36.44s)]
*  Thank you for asking. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=43.56s)]
*  Not many people ask about what is the personal journey that's been going on. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=44.56s)]
*  And it really hasn't been happening in the last year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=50.2s)]
*  It's been happening since about a month after I took office. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=51.88s)]
*  From the time I took office, I began to get threats. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=55.56s)]
*  Those threats come in the way of emails. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  Those threats come in the way of phone calls, text messages, any which way you can imagine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=60.96000000000001s)]
*  At some point, the threats became where I had to leave my home. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=68.16s)]
*  And I've been out of my home since the first year in office. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  They've come from a variety of sources. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=74.84s)]
*  One of the first things that ever happened was there was a protest at my house at 5 o'clock [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=78.08000000000001s)]
*  in the morning. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=82.92s)]
*  People mad because the last administration had left police cases, lots of them, and they [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  wanted immediate action on them. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  And so that was the first thing that kind of happened. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=90.12s)]
*  But the threats have certainly been about lots of different kinds of cases that I've [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=92.76s)]
*  prosecuted. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  People are very unhappy with them because of some recent cases that most of them are [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  racial in nature. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=102.0s)]
*  It has cost me to leave my home financially. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  I'm paying for my mortgage because I refuse to give up the home where I raise my children, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=105.88000000000001s)]
*  but also paying for another establishment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=110.48s)]
*  And I have 24-hour really protection around me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=113.28s)]
*  So it's a very interesting way to live, but it's well worth it to have the honor of being [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=118.2s)]
*  the first female district attorney in Fulton County. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=124.92s)]
*  It pales in comparison to what my victims are going through. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=127.88s)]
*  And the reality is, one of the reasons we are upsetting people is we are so successful [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=131.56s)]
*  here in Fulton County. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=135.76s)]
*  I have the third largest crime drop in America. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=136.76s)]
*  We have it because we're taking a balanced approach, both unapologetically going after [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=140.24s)]
*  gangs and violent criminals and anyone who should violate the law in my county. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=145.04s)]
*  But we're also doing programs. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=149.04s)]
*  And so it has been a huge sacrifice, but it's well worth it for my community. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=150.72s)]
*  We spoke, you did an interview with me earlier in your tenure, and we talked about what it [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=158.16s)]
*  was like to become a national lightning rod and to attract not just all the attention [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=165.88s)]
*  that a district attorney in a big place like Fulton County is always going to get locally [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=171.28s)]
*  for all of the important issues that affect the people of Fulton County, but to become [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=174.56s)]
*  a household name around the country, including by people who decided they were going to make [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=178.2s)]
*  your life hell for having brought one particularly very high-profile case. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=182.56s)]
*  Do you feel like you've changed over the course of this term in office, over the course of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=188.04s)]
*  this four years in terms of having to develop new skills, new resources, develop a thicker [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=193.0s)]
*  skin than you might not have expected when you took this case, when you ascended to office [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=200.8s)]
*  January 1, 2020? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=206.2s)]
*  This job has certainly made me closer to God because you have to go into prayer often. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=209.56s)]
*  So that's just the truth. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=214.64s)]
*  So that's a positive, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=216.04s)]
*  And you're getting closer to God. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  But I can't explain to you how much I love the work that I do. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  I can't explain to you how loved I feel by my community. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=222.88s)]
*  You really should feel sorry for those that are trying to deter me from my work. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=227.04s)]
*  It doesn't do anything but motivate me to continue to work and to work hard. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  And so I'm not someone that's going to be broken, but certainly it has caused me to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  get thicker skin or to be more resilient, to dig deeper, to work harder. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=239.68s)]
*  But what it has not done is deter me from my work. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Let me ask you about an interesting development that happened with a former Democratic governor [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=247.68s)]
*  of Georgia, Governor Roy Barnes. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=252.88s)]
*  It emerged over the course of the Trump case and some of the, forgive me, the mischigas [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=257.12s)]
*  around that, that you had asked Governor Barnes if he would consider joining the prosecution [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  as special counsel in that case. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=268.2s)]
*  And it emerged that he said no, saying, quote, I wasn't going to live with bodyguards for [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=270.92s)]
*  the rest of my life, which is a commentary on what it takes to be part of a legal system [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=275.52s)]
*  in this era, taking on politically powerful people. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=279.79999999999995s)]
*  But Governor Barnes, as far as I understand it, has since offered that if the Republican [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=283.79999999999995s)]
*  controlled legislature in Georgia comes after you with this new investigative committee [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  that they seem to have formed specifically to come after you, with some of the other [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=293.74s)]
*  ways that they seem to be targeting you, that if you need legal representation of a specialty [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=297.96s)]
*  form as part of the way they're coming after you through the legislature, that he will [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=304.08s)]
*  represent you in those matters. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=307.32s)]
*  I just wanted to ask if that's your understanding and what you make of that, those interactions [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=309.24s)]
*  that you've had with former Governor Barnes. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=314.04s)]
*  Governor Barnes is my attorney. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=317.04s)]
*  They have decided in Georgia that they would like to come over after me. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=319.92s)]
*  They use false reasons for wanting to come after me. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=324.32s)]
*  I don't know if you remember, and I believe we talked about it last time, Georgia had [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=328.28s)]
*  never had a prosecutorial oversight committee and all of a sudden 14 minorities were elected [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  to office to serve as district attorney. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=339.44s)]
*  And now all of a sudden they need an oversight committee to look after district attorneys [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  because they want to tell us how to prosecute and who to prosecute and where we should put [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=347.36s)]
*  our resources as opposed to allowing the voters that put us in these seats to make those determinations. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=352.68s)]
*  The voters in my community are very clear that they want crime out of their communities, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=360.68s)]
*  but they want it done both by removing violent offenders, which is what we have done. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=367.96s)]
*  We've gone after gangs and we've worked with our police departments to do so. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=372.4s)]
*  But they also want second chances for low level offenders. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=376.08s)]
*  And we have done those programs. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=380.44s)]
*  What is so ironic is although it's only 14 of the 50 DAs in the state of Georgia, most [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=382.4s)]
*  of the citizens report to our jurisdictions. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=389.08s)]
*  So although we're smaller in number than the other 36, most of the population has elected [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=392.28s)]
*  these minority DAs to serve them and has trusted their judgment. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=397.76s)]
*  But apparently we now need daddy to tell us how to do our job. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=402.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_vdOyEGuMM&t=419.08s)]
