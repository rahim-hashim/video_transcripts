# 'One of the more dangerous things' about Trump: Former aide on Trump need for attention
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE)
*  Ms. Hutchinson, it's nice to meet you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=1.7s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=2.54s)]
*  This is the first live interview you've done in the media. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=3.84s)]
*  It is the second live interview you have done in life. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=9.26s)]
*  The first one was your testimony. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=12.4s)]
*  How are you doing? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=14.84s)]
*  I'm doing well. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=15.96s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here with you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=18.28s)]
*  And it's an honor to have this as my first live interview. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=19.76s)]
*  Well, second live interview, I guess. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=23.92s)]
*  Second live interview. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=25.34s)]
*  The first one much more consequential than this one. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=26.18s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=27.96s)]
*  I mean, it's been 15 months since that testimony. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  Your life has changed dramatically since then. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  I said, based on what I read in your book, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  but I didn't ask you about this ahead of time, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=37.72s)]
*  I said in my introductory remarks [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=39.48s)]
*  that a lot of the reason that people haven't heard from you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=40.94s)]
*  or seen you out in the world in the last 15 months [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=43.48s)]
*  is at least in part because of concerns about your security. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=45.48s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Is that still a real life concern for you? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=50.36s)]
*  That's a fair assessment, yes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=52.08s)]
*  How are you taking care of yourself in that regard? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=54.16s)]
*  I mean, you don't have to tell me anything I shouldn't know. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=56.32s)]
*  No, you're fine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=58.08s)]
*  Open book. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=59.2s)]
*  It has been difficult in a lot of ways. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=61.0s)]
*  It's also, it's open, this year has helped me open my eyes [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=63.96s)]
*  to the dangers that Trump actually poses on people [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=68.4s)]
*  in these situations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=71.92s)]
*  And I'm not the only one. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=73.48s)]
*  And I wish I could say I'd be the last person, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=74.68s)]
*  but unfortunately I won't. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=77.68s)]
*  And that's what he does to people that he thinks [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=79.0s)]
*  that speak out against him or that detract from him. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  And it's one of the more dangerous things [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=86.68s)]
*  about Donald Trump too. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=88.36s)]
*  This is something that we've seen time and time again, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=89.52s)]
*  and it shouldn't have to be like this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=91.8s)]
*  You write about in the book repeatedly about your regret [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=94.76s)]
*  as for having not supported him, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=98.48s)]
*  but specifically for having facilitated [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=102.24s)]
*  some of the political attacks that he launched as president [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=104.56s)]
*  on people that were designed the way he designs them, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=108.48s)]
*  to hurt people maximally, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=112.12s)]
*  and in some cases to expose them to danger. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=113.36s)]
*  Did that give you any insight into why he needs politics [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  to work that way for him? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  And any insight into how to combat it? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=121.72s)]
*  It gave me an insight into his psyche [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=125.48s)]
*  while I was writing the book [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=127.92s)]
*  and helping understand my circumstances with it [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  and what I dealt with after I testified. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=133.4s)]
*  But with that said, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=137.68s)]
*  it helped also open my eyes to what he wants from people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  He wants to know that he's getting a reaction. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=145.48s)]
*  He thrives when he has an audience. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=147.76s)]
*  It could be a negative audience. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=150.32s)]
*  It could be an audience that he likes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=151.56s)]
*  It could be his base. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  But what he needs is to hear people reacting to him. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=155.04s)]
*  And that's when he knows in his mind [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=158.2s)]
*  that he has been successful to something. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  Is that why you've never responded to his attacks on you? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  I've never responded to his attacks on me [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=164.76s)]
*  because I don't need to give them oxygen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  He is going to say what he's going to say. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  And he said much worse things [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=170.16s)]
*  about much better people than I am. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=171.48s)]
*  The kind of pressure that you describe [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=174.28s)]
*  experiencing to protect Mr. Trump, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=177.28s)]
*  I mean, some of it was self-directed, right? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=179.88s)]
*  You say at one point in the book, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=183.04s)]
*  and it struck me you said that you adored him at one point, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=185.32s)]
*  that you were and are very much still a Republican, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=188.44s)]
*  that you believed in what he was trying to do [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=191.52s)]
*  for the country. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=193.2s)]
*  You wanted to be a good staffer. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=194.14s)]
*  You wanted to serve the White House. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=195.4s)]
*  You wanted to do right by your colleagues. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=196.56s)]
*  And that sort of easily leads [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=199.2s)]
*  toward the next post-presidential project for him, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=201.92s)]
*  which is protecting him from all the investigations [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  around January 6th and everything else. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=207.32s)]
*  But that pressure not only came from you, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=210.0s)]
*  it also came from his world. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  You didn't have financial resources [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=214.6s)]
*  to hire your own lawyer. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  You didn't have access to a lawyer at the outset [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=216.88s)]
*  who would represent you for free. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=219.16s)]
*  You ended up with a Trump world lawyer [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=221.0s)]
*  who you describe as having not told you to lie, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=223.16s)]
*  but encouraged you to not tell everything that you knew. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=227.88s)]
*  That pressure is very, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=232.92s)]
*  it's not just a Cassidy Hutchinson biographical detail. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  It is a live issue for a lot of people right now. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=238.11999999999998s)]
*  It's a lot of people in multiple jurisdictions [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  deciding how they're gonna respond to a subpoena, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=242.0s)]
*  what they may testify to in court, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=245.61999999999998s)]
*  what they're gonna do about their legal representation. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=247.61999999999998s)]
*  This is a live issue for a lot of people right now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=249.56s)]
*  And some of them may be watching right now. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=253.11999999999998s)]
*  What would you say to them about how to balance the equities [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=255.6s)]
*  in that kind of a calculation? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=258.88s)]
*  In my opinion, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=262.92s)]
*  I don't know if there really is a way [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=264.76s)]
*  to balance the equities. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=266.68s)]
*  If you have a self interest of being completely forthcoming [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  and truthful in what you're witnessing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=274.44s)]
*  that could potentially hurt or damage Mr. Trump. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=276.12s)]
*  And not even speaking to the issues of legal counsel, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=282.20000000000005s)]
*  just as a person knowing what I experienced. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  And like you said, some of it was self-inflicted for me. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  I knew what I wanted to do. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=291.36s)]
*  I knew how I felt about these circumstances [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=293.96000000000004s)]
*  surrounding January 6th. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=296.32s)]
*  But I also was scared to be frank. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=298.24s)]
*  I was scared at times to make that break. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=300.68s)]
*  I had seen what happened to some of my former colleagues [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=303.8s)]
*  who had made that break [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  and how they became the subjects of the vitriol [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=307.36s)]
*  and the vile rhetoric that comes out of Mr. Trump [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=309.94s)]
*  and his associates when you break with him. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=314.04s)]
*  If I were to say anything to the people though [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=317.44s)]
*  that may be finding themselves in a similar situation [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=319.72s)]
*  to the situation that I found myself in [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=323.76000000000005s)]
*  or just that they want to make that break, it's possible. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=325.76000000000005s)]
*  We can't, and what I think is, in my opinion, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  and what I think is damaging in ways [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=334.44000000000005s)]
*  is isolating the people that come out [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=337.0s)]
*  and then questioning why they did. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=340.44000000000005s)]
*  It is hard to come out. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  It was hard to find my way out because of what we said. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=344.8s)]
*  I had financial limitations and I did have other counsel, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=347.8s)]
*  but it was also hard coming out on the outside [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=352.16s)]
*  because I didn't know if I'd be welcomed by people. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=354.16s)]
*  So I think that if we can create and foster an environment [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=357.56s)]
*  where people feel that they're welcomed [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=361.7s)]
*  and that there is a life on the other side, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=364.2s)]
*  which is one of the more eye-opening parts [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=366.92s)]
*  of this experience for me too [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=369.32s)]
*  is that there are good people in this world [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=370.64s)]
*  that want to help and that are there [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=373.74s)]
*  and that have similar interests that we do. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=375.62s)]
*  We all want the republic to survive. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=378.02s)]
*  We all should want this republic to survive. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=380.06s)]
*  But in the way that Mr. Trump's trajectory currently is going, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=383.46s)]
*  I'm not confident that he will have it survive. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=388.06s)]
*  And I would just encourage them to think about that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=392.5s)]
*  When you say that we speak at a moment [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=396.82s)]
*  when Mr. Trump is dozens of points ahead [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=398.98s)]
*  of his nearest opponent [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=401.02s)]
*  in the Republican presidential primary, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=401.94s)]
*  the tone in the political press about what's happening [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=404.58s)]
*  in the Republican presidential primary [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=406.94s)]
*  is that even people who support his competitors [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=408.82s)]
*  are effectively conceding that he's gonna be the nominee. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=412.82s)]
*  Republicans seem poised to choose him again [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=415.62s)]
*  even after what happened the last time [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=418.14s)]
*  and specifically what you were able to tell the country [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=421.29999999999995s)]
*  about what it was like inside the White House. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=424.09999999999997s)]
*  I was struck in the book, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=426.65999999999997s)]
*  not just about what you said about January 6th, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=428.44s)]
*  but some of the other ways that you described [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=430.41999999999996s)]
*  what was bad about him as a president. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=433.06s)]
*  On COVID, you said, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=436.29999999999995s)]
*  I doubt any politician could have led the country [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=437.38s)]
*  through the deadliest pandemic in a hundred years [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  without making errors of judgment and execution. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=441.41999999999996s)]
*  But of all the people in the world, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=443.85999999999996s)]
*  President Trump was uniquely unsuited to the challenge. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=445.85999999999996s)]
*  He lacked empathy and was stubborn and impatient. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=448.94s)]
*  You said he had a restless, impulsive personality. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=453.5s)]
*  You described his attention span [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=456.41999999999996s)]
*  not being up to an average meeting. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=460.34s)]
*  I noticed that his eyes often wandered the room [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=462.46s)]
*  when the meetings outlasted his attention span. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=464.38s)]
*  Ultimately, you described what happened on January 6th [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=467.06s)]
*  is from him at a minimum, a shocking dereliction of duty. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=469.58s)]
*  I mean, all of the things that you described [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=473.02s)]
*  from having seen him up close are public record now. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=475.29999999999995s)]
*  None of these things are secrets. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=478.53999999999996s)]
*  Why do you think your fellow Republicans [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=480.74s)]
*  want him more than they want anybody else [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=484.26s)]
*  as their next candidate for the White House? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  I can't speak to the psyche of my, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=490.56s)]
*  I won't say my fellow Republicans [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=493.44s)]
*  because I do not think that we are [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=494.88s)]
*  a part of the same Republican party. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  I still consider myself a Republican. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=499.68s)]
*  I consider myself a Republican [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=503.12s)]
*  in the sense of Senator Mitt Romney [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=504.76s)]
*  and the Reagan Republican party. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=507.08s)]
*  I believe that the Republican party [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=509.28s)]
*  needs a strong conservative party. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=510.78s)]
*  I do not believe that Mr. Trump is a strong Republican, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=513.12s)]
*  but in this next election cycle, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=516.82s)]
*  in my opinion, it's the make or break moment [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  for the Republican party. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  Now is the time if these politicians, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=524.6800000000001s)]
*  these men and some women that are currently in Congress [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=527.44s)]
*  want to make the break and want to take the stand, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=531.6s)]
*  they have to do it now. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=534.0s)]
*  We can't wait any longer for them to do it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=536.5200000000001s)]
*  I don't know why they're so willing to support him. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  I think it's extremely disappointing [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  and it is not a hard issue to take. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=545.0s)]
*  It's, we're talking about a man [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=547.12s)]
*  who at the very essence of his being [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=549.36s)]
*  almost destroyed democracy in one day [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=552.96s)]
*  and he wants to do it again. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=555.76s)]
*  He wants to run for president to do it again. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=557.44s)]
*  He's been indicted four times since January 6th. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=560.22s)]
*  I would not have a clear conscience [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=563.94s)]
*  and be able to sleep at night [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  if I were a Republican in Congress [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=566.84s)]
*  that supported Donald Trump. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=569.0600000000001s)]
*  And I think that if they're not willing to split with that, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  then we're in serious danger for the party. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=576.0s)]
*  Who do you think's going to know? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=579.54s)]
*  Yeah, the one who's going to be in Unfortunately LikeFC dla Villa. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  And that would be Martin Luther King. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=583.9s)]
*  7 [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JGofr9kkfE&t=594.88s)]
