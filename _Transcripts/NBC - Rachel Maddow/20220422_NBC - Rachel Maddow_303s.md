# Curious Number Of Russian Oligarchs Have Died Since Invasion Of Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg)
*  This is Sergey Protosenya. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=0.0s)]
*  Until recently, he lived comfortably in France with an estimated wealth of more than $400 million. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Money he made as a former top manager of the Kremlin-connected Russian gas giant Novotek. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=9.1s)]
*  He's basically the textbook example of an oligarch. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  On Tuesday, he was found dead in a rented villa in Spain. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  According to the Spanish news outlet Tela Chinco, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=22.6s)]
*  Spanish police found his wife and daughter dead with axe and knife wounds inside the villa, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=25.6s)]
*  Protosenya hanging by a bathrobe in the garden. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=32.0s)]
*  Spanish police believe this is an isolated case of domestic violence [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=35.2s)]
*  and say this is not connected to any criminal gangs or similar cases. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=38.8s)]
*  This is Vadaslav Avayev. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=43.2s)]
*  He was the former vice president of the Russian Gazprom Bank, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=46.0s)]
*  which is the bank connected to Russia's biggest oil company Gazprom. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=49.5s)]
*  It's Russia's third largest bank. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=53.800000000000004s)]
*  Now before that, he worked in the Russian office of the president and in the state Duma. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=56.2s)]
*  On Monday, he was found dead in his luxury apartment in Moscow, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  along with his pregnant wife and 13-year-old daughter who had cerebral palsy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=65.4s)]
*  Russian state-run press says that all three died from bullet wounds [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=71.0s)]
*  and that 13 guns were discovered at the scene, including one that was found in Avayev's hand. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=74.5s)]
*  They also report that the apartment had been locked from the inside, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=80.69999999999999s)]
*  making impossible in their telling that anyone but Avayev could have been involved. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  Now these could absolutely be totally unconnected cases of men killing their families and then themselves. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=89.6s)]
*  What are the odds that two Russian oligarchs with connections to the Kremlin and the oil industry [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  decide to kill themselves within 24 hours of each other? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=101.8s)]
*  And what are the odds that four have since done so since Putin invaded Ukraine? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=105.8s)]
*  The Ukrainian-born Russian oligarch Mikhail Watford, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=111.7s)]
*  who made a fortune in Russian oil and gas in the 90s, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=115.0s)]
*  was found dead in his $23 million mansion in England on February the 28th. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=118.1s)]
*  And on the day after Russia invaded Ukraine, February 25th, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=125.1s)]
*  the financial director at Russia's biggest oil company Gazprom [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=129.0s)]
*  was found dead in a cottage near St. Petersburg. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=133.2s)]
*  Now again, these could all be unconnected individual cases of murder and suicide. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=136.7s)]
*  Both domestic violence and suicide are unfortunately common things around the world, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=142.2s)]
*  but these cases deserve a little bit of context. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=146.6s)]
*  USA Today put out an incredible report back in 2017 [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  in which they documented 38 cases of prominent Russians [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=153.7s)]
*  who had died suspiciously in the previous three years. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  They included 10 high-profile critics of Putin, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=161.8s)]
*  7 diplomats, 6 associates of Kremlin power brokers, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=164.70000000000002s)]
*  13 military or political leaders involved in the conflict over eastern Ukraine, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=168.4s)]
*  12 were shot, stabbed or beaten to death, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  6 were blown up, one died of mysterious head injuries, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=176.4s)]
*  one reportedly slipped and hit his head in a public bath, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=179.70000000000002s)]
*  one was hanged in a jail cell, and one died after drinking coffee. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=183.4s)]
*  The other 16 were reported as either natural causes or unknown. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=188.8s)]
*  The Committee to Protect Journalists says that in the 22 years that Putin has been in power, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=193.8s)]
*  25 Russian journalists have been murdered. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=198.3s)]
*  A whole bunch of them apparently just fell out of windows. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=201.8s)]
*  On April 10th, I interviewed the Russian opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Mursa. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=205.0s)]
*  He's been poisoned twice by the Kremlin. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  On April 11th, the day after we spoke with him from Moscow, Kara-Mursa was arrested. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  Today we got the news that he faces up to 15 years in prison for breaking a new law [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=217.4s)]
*  against saying anything other than the government narrative about what's happening in Ukraine. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=222.0s)]
*  Potentially 15 years in jail just for telling me and you the truth. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=226.70000000000002s)]
*  Which is not too far off from the story of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=232.5s)]
*  who was poisoned in 2020 and was just sentenced last month to 9 years in prison on completely bogus charges. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=236.9s)]
*  That kind of thing is just what Russia does. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=245.3s)]
*  So again, domestic violence and suicide are a scourge of their own. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=248.0s)]
*  And all of these recent murder and suicide cases should be investigated individually. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  But given Putin's government's history of making the people who are inconvenient to them disappear, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=257.3s)]
*  it also makes sense to investigate the possibility that the Kremlin could be involved in these deaths. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=264.1s)]
*  Four Russian oligarchs, all with direct ties to either the Kremlin or the Russian oil and gas industry, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=270.70000000000005s)]
*  all met violent ends just since this war began. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=276.70000000000005s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=281.6s)]
*  you [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkZOTXt1Uhg&t=300.6s)]
