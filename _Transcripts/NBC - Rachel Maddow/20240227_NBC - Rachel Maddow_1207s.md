# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 26
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM)
*  His name is George Rekers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=0.0s)]
*  Remember that name? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=3.12s)]
*  He was famous for being one of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=4.8s)]
*  the founders of the Family Research Council, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=6.54s)]
*  one of the original super anti-gay [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=8.8s)]
*  conservative culture war groups that became [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=11.46s)]
*  very influential in Republican politics. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=13.64s)]
*  In the 1980s, George Rekers was [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=16.18s)]
*  a founder of the Family Research Council. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=18.52s)]
*  He specifically worked in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=20.62s)]
*  the part of anti-gay politics that says [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=22.46s)]
*  that people can be cured of the gay. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=25.18s)]
*  It can be reversed with [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=27.34s)]
*  just the right therapy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=29.34s)]
*  Well, by 2010, there was George Rekers [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=31.38s)]
*  being photographed at the airport in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=34.34s)]
*  Miami in the company of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=36.28s)]
*  a handsome young man named Lucien, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=38.34s)]
*  who Mr. Rekers had apparently [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=40.82s)]
*  met on rentboy.com. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=42.56s)]
*  Mr. Rekers first tried to explain that he had taken [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=45.5s)]
*  this handsome young man on an all expenses paid [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=49.2s)]
*  10-day trip to Europe [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=52.04s)]
*  because he needed help with his luggage. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=53.68s)]
*  The young man himself, seen here, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=56.82s)]
*  not helping with the luggage, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=59.34s)]
*  eventually explained exactly what he [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=60.9s)]
*  was paid for on that European trip. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=63.26s)]
*  George Rekers ultimately resigned from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=66.58s)]
*  his job at the anti-gay organization. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=69.34s)]
*  In 2004, when Republican President [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=72.26s)]
*  George W. Bush was up for reelection, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=75.14s)]
*  the Republican Party and the Bush campaign [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=76.94s)]
*  enthusiastically promoted bans on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=79.62s)]
*  same-sex marriage in multiple states. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=82.64s)]
*  They expected that anti-gay campaigning in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  as many states as possible would [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=87.2s)]
*  goose Republican turnout and help [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=88.88s)]
*  Bush's chances of being re-elected. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=90.6s)]
*  You demonize gay people, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  scare people about gay rights, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=94.2s)]
*  you get conservative voters to turn out and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=95.68s)]
*  they'll vote Republican while they're there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=97.8s)]
*  Bush was re-elected in 2004. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  Those anti-gay state ballot initiatives [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=102.46000000000001s)]
*  very well may have helped with that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=104.36s)]
*  But then two years after Bush left the White House, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=106.48s)]
*  the man who had been chairman of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=110.12s)]
*  the Bush campaign at that time came out [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  himself as gay. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=114.16s)]
*  And to his credit, he then set about trying to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=116.2s)]
*  right the wrong he had been part of by [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=118.36s)]
*  persuading leading Republicans to change [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=121.0s)]
*  their mind on marriage equality and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=123.32s)]
*  to persuade the Supreme Court [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=126.6s)]
*  to support marriage equality, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  which they have done at least for a while. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=129.32s)]
*  But honestly, it's like you can't swing [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=132.84s)]
*  a cat without hitting one of these guys. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=135.16s)]
*  I mean, those anti-gay ballot initiatives [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=136.82s)]
*  that were supposed to help [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=139.48s)]
*  George W. Bush get re-elected in 2004, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=140.46s)]
*  they got a big boost in 2004 when a group [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=143.12s)]
*  called the National Association of Evangelicals, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=146.6s)]
*  huge influential religious group, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=149.64s)]
*  decided in 2004 that they would emphatically [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=152.48s)]
*  restate their opposition to homosexuality [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=155.1s)]
*  in all its forms, which effectively endorsed [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=157.64s)]
*  all the anti-gay measures that the Republicans [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=160.76s)]
*  were promoting all over the country [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=162.96s)]
*  in advance of the election that year. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=164.48s)]
*  The National Association of Evangelicals [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=166.76s)]
*  at that time was led by this man, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=168.68s)]
*  Ted Haggard, who soon treated the country [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=172.7s)]
*  to not at all uncomfortable headlines like this one, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=175.78s)]
*  quote, evangelist, I bought meth from gay escorts. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=178.54s)]
*  Again, I mean, follow the bouncing ball. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=184.84s)]
*  He found himself a very handsome man, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=188.02s)]
*  and it was never totally clear if he paid [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=190.62s)]
*  the handsome man for sex using the drugs [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=193.54s)]
*  as the method of payment, or maybe if he paid [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=197.78s)]
*  the man for the sex and the drugs together, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=200.14s)]
*  kind of like a meal deal or something, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  but yeah, president of the National Association [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=204.5s)]
*  of Evangelicals. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=207.5s)]
*  I got a million of these guys. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=208.77999999999997s)]
*  Trump's Oklahoma State campaign chairman from 2016 [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=210.14s)]
*  was a Republican state senator who voted [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  as an Oklahoma state senator that businesses [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=216.33999999999997s)]
*  should be able to put up signs that said, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=219.17999999999998s)]
*  we don't serve gays here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=220.73999999999998s)]
*  Trump's campaign chairman in Oklahoma in 2016 [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=224.2s)]
*  busted in 2017 for soliciting sex from exactly [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=227.3s)]
*  who you think he'd be doing that from. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=232.22s)]
*  The Republican mayor of Spokane, Washington [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=235.9s)]
*  supported banning gay people from working in schools, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=238.58s)]
*  later revealed to be meeting new friends, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=243.26000000000002s)]
*  new new friends all the time at gay.com. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=245.5s)]
*  His handle was Cobra 82, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=248.5s)]
*  because of course it was Cobra 82. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=252.18s)]
*  Sure, I could go on. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=255.56s)]
*  Really, I got a million of them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=257.4s)]
*  How much time do you have? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=258.56s)]
*  This weekend was the Conservative [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=262.04s)]
*  Political Action Conference. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=264.04s)]
*  It's an annual right-wing conference thing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=265.8s)]
*  Among the things you can reliably get at CPAC every year [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=269.08s)]
*  is anti-trans rhetoric by the dump truck full, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=272.56s)]
*  and anti-gay sermonizing as well. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=276.96s)]
*  This year was no exception. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=279.04s)]
*  It's like that every year. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=280.2s)]
*  CPAC is run by a man named Matt Schlapp. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=281.48s)]
*  It has been for years. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=284.44s)]
*  And in 2022, ahead of the congressional midterms, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=286.24s)]
*  Mr. Schlapp was in Georgia. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  He was campaigning for the Republican nominee [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  for Senate, Herschel Walker. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=294.48s)]
*  Remember Herschel Walker's Senate campaign? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=295.76000000000005s)]
*  The Walker campaign sent one of their mid-level staffers, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=298.16s)]
*  a male staffer, to drive Matt Schlapp around. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=300.68s)]
*  While in the car, Matt Schlapp allegedly put his hand [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  on the young man's leg, and then quote, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=306.16s)]
*  moved his hand and began aggressively fondling [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=308.92s)]
*  the staffer's genital area in a sustained fashion [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=311.6s)]
*  without the staffer's consent. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=317.96s)]
*  The staffer claims that Mr. Schlapp then invited [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=320.88s)]
*  the staffer to his hotel room. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=323.04s)]
*  He declined. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=324.4s)]
*  Early last year, that young man sued Matt Schlapp [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=326.2s)]
*  for sexual battery. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=328.88s)]
*  And as that lawsuit has dragged on, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=331.0s)]
*  more allegations of sexual misconduct against Matt Schlapp [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=333.4s)]
*  have come to light as part of discovery [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  in that sexual battery lawsuit. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=339.0s)]
*  Lawyers for the Republican campaign staffer discovered [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=340.08s)]
*  that in 2017, at a CPAC party, Schlapp allegedly attempted [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=343.96s)]
*  to kiss a male employee against his wishes. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=348.2s)]
*  They also discovered that at a fundraising event in 2022, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=351.0s)]
*  Mr. Schlapp was accused of stripping down to his underwear [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=354.36s)]
*  and, forgive me, rubbing against another person [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=358.32s)]
*  without his consent. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=362.56s)]
*  Now, Mr. Schlapp, for his part, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=364.96s)]
*  has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=366.6s)]
*  The lawsuit says that the American Conservative Union, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=369.12s)]
*  the parent company to CPAC, which employs Matt Schlapp, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=371.76s)]
*  knew about at least two of the allegations against Schlapp [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=374.52s)]
*  before they become public, but the lawsuit claims [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=377.64s)]
*  that the American Conservative Union has not only failed [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=380.52s)]
*  to remove Mr. Schlapp from his leadership position, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=383.36s)]
*  they also failed to pursue any kind of investigation [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=385.84s)]
*  into the claims of sexual misconduct. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=388.68s)]
*  And so, given that failure to do anything [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=390.8s)]
*  about the allegations, the American Conservative Union [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=392.72s)]
*  has now been added as a defendant [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=395.76s)]
*  in the Matt Schlapp sexual battery lawsuit. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=397.72s)]
*  The organization has thus far spent upwards [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=401.72s)]
*  of a million dollars on Matt Schlapp's legal fees [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=403.72s)]
*  to defend himself in the sexual battery case. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=407.72s)]
*  But they have meanwhile kept him in place [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=411.92s)]
*  to run the big annual anti-gay conference. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  Because sure, that's fine. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=417.8s)]
*  Who will notice? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=419.88s)]
*  For months and months, Republican lawmakers [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=422.48s)]
*  and conservative media have been trumpeting [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=425.0s)]
*  these bribery allegations made by Smernoff [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=427.48s)]
*  against President Biden and his family. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=430.24s)]
*  The Washington Post today estimates [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=432.04s)]
*  that Fox News alone mentioned it more than 2,600 times [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  over the past single year. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=439.56s)]
*  Republicans and Congressmen have been trying [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=442.72s)]
*  to get the president to step down [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=444.92s)]
*  Republicans and Congress pushed the allegation endlessly, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=447.0s)]
*  even though the FBI explicitly warned them [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  that the claim was uncorroborated and unreliable. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=453.32000000000005s)]
*  And now the man who's the source of the allegation, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=457.36s)]
*  the guy who said it, he's in jail, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  indicted for lying to federal investigators [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=462.52000000000004s)]
*  about this very matter and accused by prosecutors [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=464.6s)]
*  of feeding the FBI disinformation from Russian intelligence. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=467.68s)]
*  Which would be shocking had we not lived [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=472.44s)]
*  through the last few years. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=476.04s)]
*  Because this of course is now the third straight [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=477.64000000000004s)]
*  presidential election cycle in which Russian intelligence [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  has done some version of this. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=483.20000000000005s)]
*  In 2016, as you may have heard, Russian intelligence [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=485.68s)]
*  hacked the Democratic National Committee [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=489.44s)]
*  and the Hillary Clinton campaign. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=491.44s)]
*  And then they weaponized the material they stole [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=493.08000000000004s)]
*  by releasing hacked emails through WikiLeaks [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=495.88s)]
*  and all timed and strategically released [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  to have maximum negative effect for Clinton [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=501.6s)]
*  and the Democrats and maximum positive effect [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=504.0s)]
*  for Donald Trump and the Republicans. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=506.4s)]
*  And it was well known at the time that this whole thing [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=508.6s)]
*  was likely a Russian intelligence operation, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=511.2s)]
*  but Trump and Republicans and conservative media [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=513.2s)]
*  and the mainstream media frankly, mostly ate it up [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=515.32s)]
*  and pounced on every single email dump [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=518.2s)]
*  as if they had just come down on Mount Sinai on tablets [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=520.36s)]
*  rather than being shoveled by Russian intelligence [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=523.32s)]
*  into the garbage chute. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=527.4s)]
*  Remember Trump talking at rallies [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=529.96s)]
*  about how much he loved WikiLeaks? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=531.52s)]
*  He was welcoming it, he was asking for more. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=534.84s)]
*  Russian government and Russian intelligence sources [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=537.68s)]
*  made multiple contacts with the Trump campaign. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=539.92s)]
*  Russia ran a big weird social media campaign [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=542.32s)]
*  to try to influence American public debate [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=545.0s)]
*  and public opinion in Trump's favor. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=546.88s)]
*  The Trump campaign gave non-public polling information [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=549.44s)]
*  to a Russian intelligence agent [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=554.08s)]
*  according to the Senate Intelligence Committee. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=555.84s)]
*  The Russians had this hack and leak campaign [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=558.52s)]
*  with the Democratic emails. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=560.64s)]
*  They were very busy in 2016 trying to help Trump. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=561.52s)]
*  Then four years later, 2020, another try. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=565.36s)]
*  This time Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani was peddling stories [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=567.6800000000001s)]
*  about Joe Biden's supposed corruption [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=570.48s)]
*  that he said he had dug up from his sources in Ukraine. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=572.96s)]
*  Once again, it turned out that Giuliani's main source [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=575.88s)]
*  was Russian intelligence. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=579.12s)]
*  A report from the US office [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=581.52s)]
*  of the Director of National Intelligence [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=583.04s)]
*  later determined that Giuliani's source [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=584.72s)]
*  was part of a US election interference operation [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=587.2s)]
*  likely directed by Putin himself [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=589.88s)]
*  with the goal of helping Trump win a second term in 2020. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=592.4s)]
*  And once again, Republicans had been warned [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=596.52s)]
*  by American intelligence officials [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=598.88s)]
*  that the stuff that Giuliani was shoveling [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=600.4s)]
*  was likely part of a Russian op. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  They apparently just did not care. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=605.76s)]
*  And again, this is not some obscure thing. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=609.08s)]
*  People got sanctioned by the US government for this. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  People got indicted by the US Justice Department for this. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=613.44s)]
*  But meh, who cares? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=617.0400000000001s)]
*  It might have helped Trump, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=619.48s)]
*  so we went along with it as far as we could. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=620.6s)]
*  And now four years later, here we are again. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=624.12s)]
*  They keep doing this every election cycle. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=626.1600000000001s)]
*  They keep doing some version of the same thing. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=628.5600000000001s)]
*  The Russians keep doing the same thing. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=631.4000000000001s)]
*  What seems to be changing a little bit [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=632.8800000000001s)]
*  is that the Republicans appear to have [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=634.84s)]
*  fewer and fewer qualms each year [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=636.4000000000001s)]
*  about welcoming and even participating [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=638.44s)]
*  in these Russian campaigns. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=640.7600000000001s)]
*  Fool me once, shame on you. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=644.48s)]
*  Fool me twice, shame on me. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=645.9200000000001s)]
*  Fool me three times. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=647.32s)]
*  I clearly want to be fooled, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=648.84s)]
*  or maybe we should stop calling this foolish. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  This is something else. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=653.0s)]
*  We did this in 2016, we did this in 2020. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=655.6s)]
*  Now in 2024, Republicans appear to be more enthusiastic [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=657.88s)]
*  about participating in it than they ever have been before. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=662.08s)]
*  But of course, now this Russian disinformation campaign, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=666.64s)]
*  trying to paint Biden as mired [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=669.4s)]
*  in some kind of bribery scandal, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=671.8000000000001s)]
*  it's happening with American aid to Ukraine [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=674.88s)]
*  hanging in the balance. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=677.84s)]
*  With this life or death question looming [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=679.1600000000001s)]
*  of whether Ukraine will be able to hold off [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=681.32s)]
*  a third year of the Russian invasion. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=683.36s)]
*  Russia is doing everything it can [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=687.96s)]
*  to undermine American support for Ukraine. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=689.52s)]
*  And in the midst of a third straight effort by Russia [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  to influence our election to Republicans' benefit, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=696.4s)]
*  Republicans frankly seem quite receptive [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=699.76s)]
*  both to that election interference [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=701.88s)]
*  and to what Russia wants them to do in cutting off Ukraine. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=703.72s)]
*  These were adjacent headlines [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=708.6s)]
*  in the Washington Post last week. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=710.0400000000001s)]
*  Biden administration cancels $1.2 billion in student loans [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=712.72s)]
*  with new repayment plan, right next to, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=716.2s)]
*  Trump and allies planning militarized mass deportations [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=719.1600000000001s)]

*  Right, that's the choice, right? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=724.48s)]
*  Relief from high student loans [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=726.32s)]
*  or using the military to lock up millions of people [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=728.2800000000001s)]
*  in huge new camps. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=731.52s)]
*  Adjacent headlines in the Washington Post on the same day. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=734.08s)]
*  Both parties at the same point [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=737.32s)]
*  in general election campaigning, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=738.6s)]
*  thinking about what they wanna be doing [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=739.92s)]
*  to present to the American people [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=741.52s)]
*  about what their idea is of governing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=742.96s)]
*  And I don't know which of those two sides [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=747.32s)]
*  the American people is more in the mood for, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=749.16s)]
*  but it seems pretty clear to me at least, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=751.04s)]
*  that the best contrast for the Democrats [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=754.12s)]
*  to draw for voters this year [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=756.76s)]
*  is maybe just the simplest one, right? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=758.04s)]
*  Normal, popular, practical accomplishments [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=760.08s)]
*  from President Biden and the Democrats [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=764.32s)]

*  being screamed at the top of their lungs [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=769.96s)]

*  what they're talking about half the time [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=774.2s)]
*  because they speak in their own code. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=775.52s)]
*  Barbara McQuade, who you know and love from her time here [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=780.52s)]
*  as a legal analyst and explainer on MSNBC. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=783.0s)]
*  She has a new book that comes out tomorrow. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=786.72s)]
*  It's called Attack From Within, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=789.32s)]
*  How Disinformation is Sabotaging America. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=791.4s)]
*  And in her new book, among other things, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=794.48s)]
*  what she sees as the connection between disinformation, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=797.5600000000001s)]
*  which is the fundamental basis for the book, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=800.9200000000001s)]
*  and authoritarianism. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=804.48s)]
*  Why you need to disconnect people from facts about the world [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=806.28s)]
*  from the noble truth and all its complexity [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=810.0400000000001s)]
*  in order to get people to endorse extremism, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=812.6800000000001s)]
*  to endorse extreme new radical changes, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=816.08s)]
*  to reimagine their lives and to reimagine their country [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=819.4s)]
*  in a way they've never thought of it before. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=822.48s)]
*  Barb in her book talks about the need to hit people [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=824.92s)]
*  emotionally rather than logically. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=827.36s)]
*  She talks about the sort of the utility [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=830.4799999999999s)]
*  of the would be authoritarian leader [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=835.04s)]
*  or the authoritarian movement, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=837.0s)]
*  focusing rhetorically on declineism, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=838.64s)]
*  convincing people that the country is falling apart. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=841.4799999999999s)]
*  The country used to be great, but it's no longer great. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=843.68s)]
*  It's falling apart. It's a disaster. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=845.7199999999999s)]
*  If you can convince people of that, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=847.5999999999999s)]
*  they will have an emotional reaction about being afraid [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=849.28s)]
*  at the state of the country now. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=852.64s)]
*  They'll have an emotional reaction [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=854.16s)]
*  about wanting to rescue the country. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=855.4s)]
*  If they can be convinced that things are so far gone, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=857.28s)]
*  they will then feel the need for extreme measures, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=860.36s)]
*  for a strong man to come in and, you know, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=862.56s)]
*  maybe you got to wreck the place. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=865.24s)]
*  Maybe you got to break the rules, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=866.52s)]
*  but it's a kind of rescue mission for a country [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=867.92s)]
*  that is otherwise lost. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=869.9599999999999s)]
*  And what that means in practical terms, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=873.0s)]
*  in terms of actually running a political campaign [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=875.1999999999999s)]
*  that in a matter of months [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=877.68s)]
*  will supposedly pick a new president, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=878.72s)]
*  what that means is every day making sure [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=880.4399999999999s)]
*  that your message undermines the idea of democracy [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=883.44s)]
*  and the idea of the rule of law. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=886.24s)]
*  So, I mean, this isn't theory. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=889.48s)]
*  This isn't academic. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=893.24s)]
*  This is our lives now. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=894.24s)]
*  Trump advisor, Steve Bannon, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=895.24s)]
*  who you just saw there yelling about vermin [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  and trash at CPAC, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=899.12s)]
*  he spent last week telling his podcast listeners [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=900.6400000000001s)]
*  that the Tom Swazi election in Long Island was stolen. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=908.72s)]
*  Yes, in Steve Bannon world, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=909.5600000000001s)]
*  this was the story of last week. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=911.64s)]
*  This is the special election to replace George Santos. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=913.6s)]
*  There's no suggestion there was anything wrong [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=916.56s)]
*  with the count or anything wrong [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=918.28s)]
*  with the conduct of that election at all, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=919.64s)]
*  but it doesn't matter, a Democrat won, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=921.36s)]
*  and so therefore Steve Bannon tells his acolytes [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=923.16s)]
*  and his followers that that election must have been stolen [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=927.28s)]
*  because a Democrat won [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  and they should not respect the results of it. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=931.36s)]
*  Even when it doesn't matter, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=934.6s)]
*  when it's one special election for one congressional seat [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=936.28s)]
*  and there's no real controversy about it still, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=938.64s)]
*  you have to say elections don't count. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=941.52s)]
*  Elections aren't real. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=943.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, on top of that, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=947.28s)]
*  we've got the Republican National Committee [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=948.24s)]
*  losing its chair, Ronna Romney McDaniel. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=949.84s)]
*  She's being replaced summarily [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=952.12s)]
*  by a North Carolina Republican [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=953.8s)]
*  who is reportedly considered by Trump [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=955.64s)]
*  to be more solid specifically on the issue [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=957.76s)]
*  of throwing out election results. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=960.24s)]
*  Ms. McDaniel was no slouch on this issue herself, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=962.4s)]
*  but apparently Trump wants somebody even stronger [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=965.4s)]
*  specifically on that point. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=967.64s)]
*  He's a stop the steal guy. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=969.4s)]
*  He will be now running the RNC if Trump gets his way. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=971.56s)]
*  The politics of running against democracy, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=978.0s)]
*  the politics of getting Americans to distrust elections [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=981.04s)]
*  and ultimately not want them anymore, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=984.88s)]
*  that is inextricably intertwined [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=988.36s)]
*  with getting Americans to distrust the legal system, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=990.68s)]
*  to not trust the courts [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=993.88s)]
*  and not trust the justice system anymore, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=995.16s)]
*  to not take it seriously, to not obey its dictates, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  to not respect any of its rules. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1000.4399999999999s)]
*  And Barb's book more than anything [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1003.6s)]
*  helped me see the connection between those two points, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1005.52s)]
*  between getting rid of elections [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1008.52s)]
*  and getting rid of the rule of law. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1009.72s)]
*  You have to get rid of the rule of law, right? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1011.16s)]
*  You have to undermine and problematize it [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1012.64s)]
*  so that you can get away [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1015.1999999999999s)]
*  with what you are trying to do to elections. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1016.52s)]
*  Right, and this is all over the news right now. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1019.76s)]
*  Just on Friday, the Wisconsin Ethics Commission [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1021.48s)]
*  referred a Trump PAC and multiple Republican officials [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1023.8s)]
*  for felony prosecution, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1026.76s)]
*  for their role in a Wisconsin scheme [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1028.72s)]
*  to punish a Republican leader [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1030.88s)]
*  in the Wisconsin state legislature [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1032.76s)]
*  who Trump thought didn't fight hard enough [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1034.44s)]
*  to throw out the election results in that state. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1036.2s)]
*  We want you to throw out those election results. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1039.0s)]
*  You don't do a good enough job. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1041.2s)]
*  We're now going to allegedly commit crimes [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1042.72s)]
*  in order to turf you out of your position. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1045.6000000000001s)]
*  Recommended for prosecution as of Friday. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1049.44s)]
*  Last week, the US Supreme Court [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1052.8s)]
*  refused to throw out the sanctions, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1054.4s)]
*  the professional sanctions against Trump lawyers [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1057.28s)]
*  Sidney Powell and Lynn Wood [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1059.8799999999999s)]
*  for their efforts to overthrow the election results. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1061.8s)]
*  Mike Lindell, Mike Pillow. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1064.9599999999998s)]
*  Last week, he was ordered by a judge to pay up [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1067.04s)]
*  in a contest he held where he promised $5 million cash [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1069.52s)]
*  to anybody who could disprove his claims [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1073.1599999999999s)]
*  that a foreign government helped steal the election [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1075.52s)]
*  for Biden. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1077.9599999999998s)]
*  Somebody did disprove those claims, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1078.8s)]
*  and now a court says Mr. Pillow has to pay. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1080.56s)]
*  He of course does not want to pay, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1083.24s)]
*  but a court says he must. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1084.76s)]
*  In Georgia, the right-wing group True the Vote [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1086.76s)]
*  that apparently ginned up all the false claims [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1089.32s)]
*  about supposed problems in the Georgia elections in 2020. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1091.6799999999998s)]
*  They made hay with those claims [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1094.9199999999998s)]
*  for not just weeks around the election, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1096.8s)]
*  but months and ultimately years. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1098.8s)]
*  But when it got put through the legal system, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1100.9199999999998s)]
*  they had to admit to a judge that no, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1104.84s)]
*  they don't actually have any evidence [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1107.24s)]
*  to back up their claims that there was fraud in Georgia. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1109.12s)]
*  Trump and multiple Georgia co-defendants [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1112.08s)]
*  are now going to go on trial [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1114.08s)]
*  for trying to overthrow the election result in Georgia, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1115.72s)]
*  which they did by citing this fake evidence [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1118.72s)]
*  from this group True the Vote. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1121.56s)]
*  What will happen in that case? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1124.44s)]
*  Will that case come to trial? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1126.72s)]
*  Trump and his co-defendants' best hope [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1128.72s)]
*  is not their defense, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdyREenLOM&t=1130.44s)]
