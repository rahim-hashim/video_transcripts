# Defense Secretary Called Italy To Debunk Ridiculous 'Italygate' Conspiracy Theory
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4)
*  Among the things we learned at today's hearing was about a new national embarrassment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=0.0s)]
*  How our Defense Department called a whole other country and showed our dirty laundry [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=4.88s)]
*  about just how far our own government under Donald Trump was willing to go to pursue even [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=10.08s)]
*  the most bonkers, bonkers, bonkers conspiracy theories. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=14.5s)]
*  The final email here included a completely baseless conspiracy theory that an Italian [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=19.96s)]
*  defense contractor uploaded software to a satellite that switched votes from Trump to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=24.86s)]
*  Biden. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=31.02s)]
*  The select committee investigation found that this wild baseless conspiracy theory made [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=32.42s)]
*  it from the recesses of the internet to the highest echelons of our government. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  On December 31st, Mr. Meadows received this internet conspiracy theory from Representative [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=43.3s)]
*  Perry. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  On the screen now is the text that Representative Perry sent to Mr. Meadows, copying a YouTube [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=52.14s)]
*  link with the message, quote, why can't we just work with the Italian government? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=56.58s)]
*  The next day, the president's chief of staff sent the YouTube link to Mr. Rosen, who forwarded [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=61.78s)]
*  it to Mr. Donahue. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=68.38s)]
*  Mr. Donahue, did you watch this video? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=70.54s)]
*  I did, Congressman. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=73.5s)]
*  How long was the video? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=74.9s)]
*  Approximately 20 minutes. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  Let's just take a look at an excerpt of that video, if we may. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=78.14s)]
*  What's being said out of Rome, out of Italy, is that this was done in the U.S. embassy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=83.06s)]
*  There was a certain State Department guy whose name I don't know yet. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=90.54s)]
*  I guess this is probably going to come out in Italy at some point. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=95.9s)]
*  He was the mastermind, not the mastermind, but the guy running the operation of changing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=100.06s)]
*  the votes, and that he was doing this in conjunction with some support from MI6, the CIA, and this [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  Leonardo group. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Donahue, what was your reaction when you watched that entire 20-minute video? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  I emailed the acting attorney general and I said pure insanity, which was my impression [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=125.66s)]
*  of the video, which was patently absurd. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=131.94s)]
*  Patently absurd. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=137.62s)]
*  A patently absurd video about vote switching satellites and the Leonardos made its way [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=138.62s)]
*  from Republican Congressman Scott Perry to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, then [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=144.44s)]
*  to the highest levels of the U.S. Justice Department. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=149.02s)]
*  We learned today that the White House Chief of Staff then didn't let it go. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=151.7s)]
*  He wanted the attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, to meet personally with the man you saw speaking [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=154.94s)]
*  on the video. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=160.56s)]
*  Mr. Rosen shut that down in no uncertain terms, but still the White House would not let the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=161.66s)]
*  matter go. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=166.62s)]
*  White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows later passed the matter on to the defense secretary. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  To ask for him was, can you call out the defense attache, Ron, and find out what the heck's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=173.1s)]
*  going on because I'm getting all these weird, crazy reports and probably the guy on the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=179.26s)]
*  ground who is more than anything. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=183.3s)]
*  The select committee confirmed that a call was actually placed by Secretary Miller to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=185.9s)]
*  the attache in Italy to investigate the claim that Italian satellites were switching votes [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=191.82s)]
*  from Trump to Biden. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=197.62s)]
*  This is one of the best examples of the lengths to which President Trump would go to stay [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=199.58s)]
*  in power. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=205.62s)]
*  Scouring the internet to support his conspiracy theories shown here, as he told Mr. Donahue [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=207.34s)]
*  in that December 27th call, quote, you guys may not be following the internet the way [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=215.5s)]
*  I do. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=221.34s)]
*  The other revelation about this today, and it's just astonishing, is that the guy who [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  was promoting this was working with Rudy Giuliani. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=228.45999999999998s)]
*  And they were very offended that they didn't mean that they could stovepipe their concerns, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  right to the attorney general? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=236.06s)]
*  You know, they say the internet is undefeated, and shout out to the internet, there's all [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=237.06s)]
*  kinds of interesting stuff on there. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  This is bananas. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=242.78s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=243.78s)]
*  That's the insane part, to quote him. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=244.98s)]
*  The serious part is, it's still pressure on the Pentagon to get involved in discrediting [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=247.06s)]
*  the election. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=252.02s)]
*  And it gets the Secretary of Defense to call another country and be like, hi, we're looking [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=253.02s)]
*  into this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=256.62s)]
*  I'm the Secretary of Defense of America. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=257.62s)]
*  And that other country is like, sweet, Berlusconi looks totally normal now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=260.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=265.1s)]
*  Yeah, they love getting the call. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=266.1s)]
*  You may not be following the internet the way I do. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=267.1s)]
*  That might be the problem. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=268.54s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=269.54s)]
*  You can follow the internet in order to know what's going on. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=270.54s)]
*  The President of the United States believing that the Department of Justice, the government [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=271.54s)]
*  that works for him, they don't follow the internet. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=275.02000000000004s)]
*  They don't follow the internet like he does. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=277.3s)]
*  The amazing thing here, though, is that what we get is some form of accountability, honestly. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=278.66s)]
*  The reason that you do a congressional investigation is in part so that we can talk about it right [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=284.1s)]
*  now, so that the public knows that this happens. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=287.82000000000005s)]
*  That the lengths to which they went included having the defense secretary follow up on [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=290.54s)]
*  the crazy Italian satellite YouTube video that somebody texted to the White House chief [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=295.1s)]
*  of staff a quarter before midnight on New Year's Eve. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=300.54s)]
*  Was there alcohol involved? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=303.22s)]
*  I don't know, but I kind of hope so, because otherwise that's a worse explanation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=304.22s)]
*  Us knowing this is part of the accountability that we're looking for. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=308.22s)]
*  Because I think the thing we'll be talking about long after these are done and the things [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=311.82s)]
*  that may justify a deeper dive is how deep down into the government his lies and as Bill [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=315.22s)]
*  Barr would say, his BS spun those agencies around from what were core missions. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=322.06s)]
*  It had nothing to do with defending the United States of America here or around the world. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=326.58000000000004s)]
*  To be picking up the phone and saying, you know, hey, you know, do you have a translator [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=330.5s)]
*  on I have to ask you about this thing on YouTube? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=335.38s)]
*  You know, neither did it justify anyone's time or energy to have DOJ. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=337.78s)]
*  It sounds like they ran down everything short of that one. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=341.5s)]
*  And by the way, you know, when he didn't call the Department of Defense, when the Capitol [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=343.94s)]
*  was being ransacked. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=347.06s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=348.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlc88sV7TP4&t=349.06s)]
