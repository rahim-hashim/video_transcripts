# Nuclear Power Plant In Ukraine Under Attack By Russian Troops; Fire Reported
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg)
*  This on your screen right now is a live video from a nuclear plant in Ukraine in a city [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=0.0s)]
*  called Enerhodar. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  It is not only the largest nuclear plant in Ukraine, but let's be clear, it is actually [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=7.96s)]
*  the largest nuclear plant in all of Europe. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=12.56s)]
*  And according to Ukraine's minister of foreign affairs, tonight Russia right now is firing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=16.06s)]
*  on all sides of that nuclear power plant in Enerhodar. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=22.5s)]
*  The mayor of the city says that the plant is currently on fire. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=26.639999999999997s)]
*  This video was caught on the security camera earlier this evening, appearing to show some [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  kind of projectile being fired at the plant. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=35.4s)]
*  The International Atomic Energy Agency, which as you know works to promote safe use of nuclear [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=39.08s)]
*  power around the world, says that they are aware of reports of the shelling outside this [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=44.76s)]
*  plant that is taking place in Ukraine. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=49.22s)]
*  They say they are in contact with Ukrainian authorities about this situation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=51.76s)]
*  Now we actually talked about this plant last night because yesterday you may recall hundreds [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  of the plant workers and people from the nearby city who live around it, they actually formed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=62.48s)]
*  kind of a human shield in the road leading up to the nuclear power plant. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=68.16s)]
*  Russia, as we have noted throughout this program and others, has already seized the site of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=71.8s)]
*  the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=76.12s)]
*  And the fear is that Russia will try to seize other active nuclear power plants in Ukraine, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=78.48s)]
*  which supply most of the nation's electricity. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=85.0s)]
*  And so the people who live around this particular plant yesterday tried to block access to it, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  tried to stop Russia from having an easy time from taking it over. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=93.76s)]
*  Tonight, according to Ukrainian officials, Russia is firing on all sides of this power [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  plant. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  Again, you're looking at a live video that is being broadcast by the plant. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  And I should note that this is the middle of the night in Ukraine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=110.48s)]
*  And the number of people watching this static, grainy black and white security camera feed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=114.4s)]
*  of a nuclear power plant, it's not exactly must-see TV right now. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=120.84s)]
*  But right now, in this very moment, thousands of people are doing just that out of fear [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=126.28s)]
*  of what could happen next, because the potential for a catastrophe here is just unparalleled. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=132.16s)]
*  It is one thing for Russia to seize energy production in Ukraine, to cut off electricity, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=137.76s)]
*  to kind of put the cities under blackout. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=142.6s)]
*  But doing it by force, doing it with live ammunition is just unfathomably dangerous. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=145.6s)]
*  Like I said, officials say the plant is already on fire. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=153.14s)]
*  And a fire alone can affect the plant's cooling system, causing the reactors to overheat [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=156.74s)]
*  and melt down, which is what happened in Japan at Fukushima back in 2011. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  And it's in some ways its own kind of slow-moving nuclear disaster. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=167.22s)]
*  And then, of course, with fire and meltdowns come the potential explosion. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=172.10000000000002s)]
*  More than 50,000 people live in the city around this nuclear plant. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=176.98000000000002s)]
*  It is about 250 miles from Ukraine's second largest city, a little over 400 miles from [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=180.46s)]
*  Kiev. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=185.66s)]
*  And if we learned anything from the Chernobyl disaster, radioactive nuclear waste can travel [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=187.42s)]
*  far, it can travel fast in an explosion. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=191.98s)]
*  The Ukrainian foreign minister saying this tonight, Russians must immediately cease the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=196.5s)]
*  fire and allow firefighters to establish a security zone. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=201.26s)]
*  If the plant blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chernobyl. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=206.04s)]
*  Joining us now is James Acton. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=212.34s)]
*  He is the co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=213.7s)]
*  Peace. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=218.06s)]
*  Mr. Acton, thank you so much for being here with us tonight. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=219.06s)]
*  I think I and a lot of people around the world, certainly people watching this program, have [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=220.82s)]
*  a lot of questions about how exactly to process what we are learning this evening coming out [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=224.26s)]
*  of Ukraine. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=230.06s)]
*  Instinctively, a lot of people are going to be concerned, what threat does a fire like [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=231.06s)]
*  the one we just heard about pose to a plant like this? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=235.98s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on this evening. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=240.3s)]
*  And this is a serious situation. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=242.62s)]
*  The first thing that I want to emphasize is that radiation levels around the plant appear [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=244.9s)]
*  to be normal right now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=250.78s)]
*  The plant's own website measures radiation levels. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  They put that data out in real time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=257.38s)]
*  The website crashed just before we went on air, I think just because of the sheer number [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=259.86s)]
*  of people trying to get access to it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=263.32s)]
*  But last time I was able to get access to the website and last time, and the most recent [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=265.86s)]
*  information we have from Ukrainian authorities is that radiation levels at the plant are [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=270.18s)]
*  normal. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=274.70000000000005s)]
*  The big concern, though, is the one that you highlighted, which is the possibility that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=275.70000000000005s)]
*  a fire could disrupt the power supplies for the plant's cooling systems without which [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=280.22s)]
*  fuel inside the reactor would melt down. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=289.3s)]
*  Now, I have no knowledge of the status of those cooling systems and in particular the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=292.46s)]
*  status of the power supplies of the cooling systems, but that's the most important concern [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=298.26s)]
*  in this situation. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=303.53999999999996s)]
*  And the first thing that comes to mind, obviously, is being able to protect the cooling system [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=305.5s)]
*  and to try to put that fire out. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  That is just what instinctively appears to me to be the first cause of action, I should [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=311.44s)]
*  say, or course of action. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=317.12s)]
*  From your expertise, what needs to happen now to mitigate the potential damage here? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=318.96s)]
*  What can be done to prevent a potential catastrophic event? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=323.68s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  The key here is to extinguish the fire and thus to prevent irreparable damage to the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=331.79999999999995s)]
*  power supplies for the cooling system. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=338.56s)]
*  The concern that I've always had, I mean, had since the beginning of this falling war, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=341.64s)]
*  is that in the event that there were an accident as a nuclear power plant, such as a fire, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=347.32s)]
*  that firefighters wouldn't be able to get to the plant, partly because they're so busy [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=352.76s)]
*  in other activities, I'm sure this is a priority for them, but also because they're in a war [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=357.28s)]
*  so they can literally be shot by Russian forces trying to get to the plant. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  Ukrainian authorities have said that has happened. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=365.28s)]
*  So I very much hope that firefighters have been able to get to the plant and have been [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  able to extinguish the blaze. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=373.0s)]
*  I have no information on the status of the blaze at the moment. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=374.64s)]
*  But you're absolutely right that it's getting firefighting equipment and the firefighters [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=379.56s)]
*  to the plant that's the most immediate priority in this situation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=384.0s)]
*  Just because you have much more information and understanding of how this works, could [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=389.8s)]
*  an attack like this have the potential to drain the pools in which the spent fuel is [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=395.4s)]
*  stored at these plants? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=402.97999999999996s)]
*  Can you tell us why that would be so dangerous and what the potential damage could be here? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=404.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean, we heard the Ukrainian foreign minister describe this plant by saying it could be [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=409.9s)]
*  10 times worse than Chernobyl. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=414.46s)]
*  Can you put that in perspective for us? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=417.9s)]
*  I'm not sure if you're aware about this plant and in terms of its output, just how realistic [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=419.38s)]
*  that would be. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=423.41999999999996s)]
*  So in terms of people are naturally going to Chernobyl as an example here for obvious [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=426.42s)]
*  reasons. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=433.58000000000004s)]
*  The more relevant example is Fukushima. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=434.94s)]
*  That is one of the worst case scenarios from here. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=438.26s)]
*  I'm not predicting that we are going to end up with a Fukushima like accident. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=443.5s)]
*  But that was a meltdown caused by a complete loss of cooling in the plant. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=447.86s)]
*  In that case, it was a tsunami that caused all of the loss of cooling in the plant. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=452.02000000000004s)]
*  In terms of spent fuel, I think it is extraordinarily unlikely that the kind of weapons that have [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=457.38s)]
*  been reported to be used around the plant would have the capability to damage the spent [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=464.94s)]
*  fuel pools. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=471.14000000000004s)]
*  But if hypothetically those pools were to be damaged and were to drain, you have a very [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=472.14000000000004s)]
*  Typically, you have a pretty large amount of spent fuel sitting in those pools from [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=480.9s)]
*  all of the time the reactor has been in operation. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=487.85999999999996s)]
*  Without cooling, there would be a serious risk of that fuel melting down, potentially [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=491.38s)]
*  releasing extremely large amounts of radiation. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=496.9s)]
*  I want to emphasize here that nothing I have seen tonight in terms of the reports of the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=500.26s)]
*  weaponry used around the plant makes me think there is any likelihood of a spent fuel pool [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=507.78s)]
*  accident. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=512.3399999999999s)]
*  Rather, my bigger concern here is about the fuel currently inside the reactors and keeping [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=513.3399999999999s)]
*  that material cool. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=521.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm very appreciative that you are able to provide that perspective and context for us [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=522.9399999999999s)]
*  about what concerns you. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=528.06s)]
*  I think some people who are watching this are going to be asking a similar question [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=529.62s)]
*  to what we asked just a couple of days ago when Russia was advancing on the site of the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=532.98s)]
*  Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which is what would happen if Russia seized Ukraine's power grid [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=537.38s)]
*  and was able to cut off this nuclear power plant's access to it? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=542.9799999999999s)]
*  Is that something that you're worried about? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=546.5799999999999s)]
*  Because the assumption that is made by some analysts is that Russia wants to control the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=549.0999999999999s)]
*  power that runs throughout the entire country as another pressure point to apply to the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=552.9799999999999s)]
*  people of Ukraine in being able to, for lack of a better word, get their surrender in this [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=557.9s)]
*  conflict. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=563.8199999999999s)]
*  There's a very serious risk there. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=565.7800000000001s)]
*  Nuclear power plants are not isolated islands that are entirely self-contained. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=567.94s)]
*  They require, we've already talked about the need in this case for firefighters to be able [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=574.34s)]
*  to get there. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=579.1400000000001s)]
*  The cooling systems, if a reactor is scrammed, if a reactor is shut down, and I assume that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=581.3000000000001s)]
*  the three reactors that were operating today have now all been scrammed as a result of this [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=586.98s)]
*  accident, they require power to cool themselves. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=592.02s)]
*  Ideally, that power comes from a nation's electricity grid. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=596.8199999999999s)]
*  One of the concerns about the fire is that it can break the power connection into the plant. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=601.38s)]
*  It's possible that shelling, if it's correct that the plants have been shelled, I'm not [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=608.74s)]
*  entirely clear what specific kind of munition was used, but it's possible that shelling could [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=615.46s)]
*  break that grid connection. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=620.26s)]
*  It's possible that Russia could deliberately attack electricity grids, as for example NATO [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=623.22s)]
*  did during the 1999 Kosovo conflict. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=629.54s)]
*  There is absolutely a danger to the plant if its external electricity connection is cut. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=634.58s)]
*  Now, there are backup power supplies within all nuclear power plants. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=640.02s)]
*  They're typically provided by emergency diesel generators. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  I believe that is what this plant is outfitted with too. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=648.02s)]
*  But again, a fire could, in the worst case, disrupt the working of those diesel generators, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=651.14s)]
*  especially if firefighters can't get on site. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=656.8199999999999s)]
*  I just want to say and share with our viewers right now, while you and I were speaking, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=659.9399999999999s)]
*  we've gotten a statement from the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky about this specific [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=662.8199999999999s)]
*  topic. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=667.62s)]
*  In a short while ago, he posted a video on the Telegram channel that he has been communicating [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=668.74s)]
*  with the public. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=673.46s)]
*  I'm going to read a part of it here. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=674.02s)]
*  It says, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=675.14s)]
*  Europe has to wake up now. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=675.9399999999999s)]
*  The NPP is on fire now. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=677.9399999999999s)]
*  Europeans, wake up, please. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=681.22s)]
*  It is time to wake up. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=683.46s)]
*  So again, clearly significant news coming out of Ukraine at this hour. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=685.86s)]
*  And now the reaction coming both from the Ukrainian leadership as well as we mentioned [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=690.74s)]
*  the International Atomic Energy Agency. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=694.42s)]
*  We also understand that the White House, the president has been in touch with President [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=696.34s)]
*  Zelensky. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=700.18s)]
*  We'll try to get a readout of that phone call when we have it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=700.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZO2x2o-rHg&t=705.14s)]
