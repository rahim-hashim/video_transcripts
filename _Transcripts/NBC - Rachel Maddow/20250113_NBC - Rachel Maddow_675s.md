Video Description: Rachel Maddow marvels at the fact that even with a second chance at it, Donald Trump cannot manage to oversee a presidential transition that isn't chaotic and in poor order, including failing to get the proper paperwork done on his own Cabinet nominees.

# Maddow: Trump Cabinet confirmation process already falling apart
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc)
*  You know, I just want to—I'm going to speak a little bit bluntly this evening, and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=0.0s)]
*  I hope you will understand where this is coming from. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=4.16s)]
*  But I think it is worth being blunt about the fact that it would be hard to run a presidential [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=7.38s)]
*  transition that could be worse than the last one. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=13.0s)]
*  The last presidential transition was the worst one in American history by a long mile. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=16.78s)]
*  The last one included the outgoing president inciting his followers to riot and storm [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  the Capitol to try to keep him in power. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  That's a bad transition, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=28.52s)]
*  I mean, the last inauguration had to have thousands of National Guard troops on hand [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=30.52s)]
*  to protect the proceedings from the threat of more violence from his followers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=34.8s)]
*  At the last presidential transition, the outgoing president didn't even show up for his successors [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=40.0s)]
*  swearing in. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=44.8s)]
*  That's a bad transition. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=45.8s)]
*  The last transition Donald Trump was part of was the worst presidential transition in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=47.8s)]
*  the history of the country. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=52.44s)]
*  And given how disastrously he performed in that last transition, I mean, you have to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=54.56s)]
*  just assume that this one inherently will be better. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=59.6s)]
*  It has to be, right? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=63.08s)]
*  But I think it is worth being blunt about the fact that it might be close, because this [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=65.36s)]
*  too is a terrible, terrible presidential transition. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=69.62s)]
*  And I think it ought to be more central to the way that we are talking about what's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=74.76s)]
*  going on in politics and in our country and in government at this moment. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=78.08s)]
*  Because this is the transition where the president-elect, right, throughout the presidential transition [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=84.68s)]
*  period has continued to sell his junk, right, his self-branded watches and sneakers and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=89.84s)]
*  Bibles. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=97.64s)]
*  He put out a new Inauguration Day edition of his special branded Bible. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=98.64s)]
*  He's still selling boots. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=104.64s)]
*  Now he's selling Trump boots and his new crypto, whatever it is, and his commemorative [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=107.0s)]
*  coins and his commemorative guitars. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=113.44s)]
*  He's selling this stuff while he is the president-elect. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=117.2s)]
*  Nothing like that has ever happened before. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=121.56s)]
*  Nothing that classless and tacky has ever happened to the U.S. presidency before. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  This is the transition where he said at a press conference that it might have been Hezbollah [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=132.44s)]
*  that did the January 6th attack. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=139.24s)]
*  Really, Hezbollah did it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=141.24s)]
*  He also said at that same press conference that he's going to pardon the people who [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=142.98s)]
*  did the January 6th attack. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=146.78s)]
*  Well, I'm sure Hezbollah will be delighted. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=148.17999999999998s)]
*  This is the transition where he made unprovoked threats to seize territory from three other [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=150.78s)]
*  nations, three other nations with whom we are allied. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=155.62s)]
*  And that is, of course, inexplicable to those countries. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  It's inexplicable to most Americans. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=162.89999999999998s)]
*  But it's also equally very exciting to the dictators of Russia and China, who actually [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  either seizing territory from other countries or planning to. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=171.34s)]
*  And now, whether or not Trump actually follows through on these weird threats, those two [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  dictators will have Trump's words during the transition to throw back at the United [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=178.9s)]
*  States of America, if the U.S. ever again bothers to object to big countries like theirs [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=183.3s)]
*  stomping on small countries and seizing their land. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=192.94s)]
*  Welcome back to the 19th century. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=193.94s)]
*  Sorry, no, there's no penicillin. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=195.22s)]
*  This is the presidential transition where the president-elect officially became a 34 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=198.72s)]
*  times convicted felon 10 days before he was sworn in. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=202.88s)]
*  This is the presidential transition when that same president-elect named a convicted felon, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=206.74s)]
*  one of his relatives, to be ambassador to France. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=211.42s)]
*  This is the transition where he picked his son's ex-girlfriend to be ambassador to Greece. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=214.92s)]
*  And he insisted that his other son's wife should be made a U.S. senator until that effort [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=219.88s)]
*  embarrassingly collapsed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=224.8s)]
*  This is the transition where he picked his son-in-law's college roommate to be the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=226.84s)]
*  hostages envoy for the United States. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=230.56s)]
*  That same son-in-law then announced that he'd received another one and a half billion dollars [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=233.36s)]
*  from government-controlled funds in Qatar and Abu Dhabi, on top of the billions of dollars [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=237.84s)]
*  he already got from government-controlled funds in Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=243.0s)]
*  Because you know how Republicans are very sensitive to the ethics of any presidential [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=246.36s)]
*  son doing any kind of international business. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=250.6s)]
*  This is the transition where the president-elect appears to have just randomly picked people [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=254.92s)]
*  off the TV for almost every imaginable government job. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=258.52s)]
*  He picked a syndicated daytime TV doctor to run Medicare. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=262.88s)]
*  The one who says your horoscope is very important to understanding your health. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=267.32s)]
*  Like literally, what's your sign, baby? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=273.32s)]
*  That determines your health. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=275.74s)]
*  He picked Fox News contributors or Fox News hosts or their relatives for Secretary of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=278.3s)]
*  Transportation, National Security Advisor, FDA Commissioner, Counterterrorism Director, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=283.4s)]
*  Ambassador to Israel, Surgeon General, Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Border Czar, Ukraine [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=287.88s)]
*  Envoy, and did I mention Defense Secretary. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=292.88s)]
*  All of those people he just picked off the TV. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=295.76s)]
*  He just picked them off of Fox News. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=299.12s)]
*  He tried to pick someone for attorney general who was actively under investigation for statutory [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  rape and prostitution. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=306.4s)]
*  And that one had to collapse because of course it did, but not before he and the vice president [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  elect went so far out on a limb for that guy that they made multiple Republican senators [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=313.38s)]
*  publicly promise to vote for that guy despite the statutory rape and prostitution investigation [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=318.1s)]
*  and all the rest of it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=324.18s)]
*  Those Republican senators, are they going to get their dignity or their political capital [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=326.58s)]
*  back? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=330.18s)]
*  If so, is there like a window where they check in for that? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=331.18s)]
*  This is a shambolic presidential transition. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=333.6s)]
*  It is a ridiculously bad, poorly run presidential transition, which ought to be the subject [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=338.1s)]
*  of some discussion in our country. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=345.02000000000004s)]
*  It is not going well. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  And while the president elect has already had to withdraw that disastrous attorney general [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=350.58000000000004s)]
*  nomination and he had to withdraw his nomination for someone to run the DEA as well, that one [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=356.02000000000004s)]
*  lasted like three days, and then they had to take back whatever that effort was to try [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  to make his daughter-in-law a senator, again, whatever that effort was. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=366.38s)]
*  While all of those falling rocks have already fallen onto the proverbial road here, now [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=370.29999999999995s)]
*  we're one week out from the end of the transition. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=376.61999999999995s)]
*  We're one week out from the inauguration. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=378.7s)]
*  And in this last week, we are about to enter into the part of this very poorly run transition [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=382.34s)]
*  where the confirmation hearings are going to start. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  And specifically where the confirmation hearings are apparently going to start falling apart. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=389.78s)]
*  And I say that because tomorrow was supposed to be the confirmation hearing for Trump's [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=394.58s)]
*  nominee to run the VA, to run Veterans Affairs. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  Now, most people could not pick that nominee, Doug Collins, out of a lineup as a nominee [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=402.82s)]
*  to run the VA. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=407.56s)]
*  He is a bit of a walking scandal. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=408.56s)]
*  The only thing he's known for when it comes to the VA is his stated desire to get rid [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=410.36s)]
*  of it, to privatize it, to no longer have a VA that takes care of our veterans. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=414.5s)]
*  So scandal enough in the nomination. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=419.97999999999996s)]
*  But that said, Collins' confirmation hearing is supposed to be tomorrow, but today they [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=422.08s)]
*  announced it's not going to be. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=426.09999999999997s)]
*  And why have they canceled the confirmation hearing for Doug Collins? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=428.28s)]
*  It's because they haven't finished the paperwork and background checks necessary to start his [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=432.68s)]
*  hearings. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=438.12s)]
*  Oops. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=439.12s)]
*  The day before that one is supposed to happen, that one is now not happening. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=440.12s)]
*  Tomorrow is also supposed to be the confirmation hearing for Trump's nominee for Interior [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=444.96s)]
*  Doug Burgum, not a familiar name, I know, but you might remember him as the obscure [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=450.6s)]
*  Republican presidential candidate who had to pay his way into the debates. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=455.16s)]
*  There was a provision in the Republican primary debate rules where you had to get a certain [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=459.92s)]
*  number of people to become donors to your campaign in order for you to get into the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=463.68s)]
*  debates. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=469.08000000000004s)]
*  Doug Burgum was nowhere near the sufficient number of donors that he would need to get [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  him into the debate. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=475.34000000000003s)]
*  So he literally paid people to donate to him. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=477.66s)]
*  He would give you money. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=483.5s)]
*  He would give you $20 if you turn around and gave him $1 as a donation. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=484.66s)]
*  And apparently that was legal. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=491.18s)]
*  But that is how Doug Burgum got into the Republican presidential debates, which if you don't [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=493.0s)]
*  live in North Dakota, that's the only thing you know him from. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=498.14000000000004s)]
*  Now Trump wants him to run the Department of the Interior, because sure, why not? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=502.34000000000003s)]
*  Doug Burgum's confirmation hearing was also supposed to be tomorrow, but it also now has [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=507.26s)]
*  been called off because, like with the guy they want to abolish, I mean lead the VA, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=512.58s)]
*  the Trump transition was also just unable to get the paperwork together for the Doug [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=518.38s)]
*  Burgum nomination. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=523.46s)]
*  So now Doug Burgum can't have his confirmation hearing tomorrow either. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=526.22s)]
*  Both of them called off the day before the hearings were supposed to happen. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=530.54s)]
*  And now here's word of another. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=535.86s)]
*  And this one is for the Trump nominee, who I think is probably the least confirmable [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=538.22s)]
*  of any of them. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=544.5400000000001s)]
*  This is the Trump nominee who I would argue might even be less confirmable than Matt Gaetz [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=545.74s)]
*  would have been if they had left him as the nominee for attorney general. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=552.34s)]
*  I'm speaking, of course, of Trump's choice for director of national intelligence, Tulsi [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=556.62s)]
*  Gabbard. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=561.3000000000001s)]
*  This is the choice when this nomination was announced, Russian state TV reacted to this [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=563.18s)]
*  announcement like it was the Kremlin's biggest international victory since they launched [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=568.42s)]
*  Sputnik. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=572.6999999999999s)]
*  A source at the Senate Intelligence Committee told us last week that Republicans were hoping [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=576.2199999999999s)]
*  the confirmation hearing for Tulsi Gabbard was going to be this Friday, January 17th. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=581.42s)]
*  So that was the date we had penciled in for Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=586.38s)]
*  But it's not happening. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=590.54s)]
*  Amid multiple reports of yet more trouble getting the paperwork together, Tulsi Gabbard's [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=592.14s)]
*  confirmation hearing is not on the calendar for this week. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=598.66s)]
*  It has still not been scheduled at all. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=601.62s)]
*  And this is one to watch, just to see if it ever gets scheduled ever. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=603.9s)]
*  They have already had to pull two of their botched nominations. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=609.5s)]
*  They had to pull the botched nomination for attorney general and also the botched nomination [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=612.66s)]
*  for DEA. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=617.22s)]
*  Watch this Gabbard nomination as well, given what's emerged just in public reporting [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=618.8199999999999s)]
*  on Tulsi Gabbard's background, public reporting more recently on how poorly she has been doing [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=623.22s)]
*  in her meetings with senators. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=629.66s)]
*  Also, we're all listening very attentively to the conspicuous silence from Capitol Hill [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=631.5s)]
*  in terms of whether or not there is going to be sufficient support for her to even make [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=638.54s)]
*  it through committee. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=641.74s)]
*  It has been a deafening silence. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=643.4599999999999s)]
*  So if anybody is next to be pulled, it might be—well, there's a bunch. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=646.16s)]
*  It might be—Tulsi Gabbard's one to watch. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Au88UrVeoc&t=651.6s)]
