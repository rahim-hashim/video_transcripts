# Why Republicans are hiding behind the politics of personality
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI)
*  Early in my term, I announced a major plan to provide more than 40 million working and middle-class American student debt relief. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tens of millions. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=7.82s)]
*  Tens of millions of people's debt was literally about to get canceled. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=13.58s)]
*  But then some of my Republican friends and elected officials and special interests sued us and the Supreme Court blocked us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=18.34s)]
*  But that didn't, well, that didn't stop us. Today, I'm proud to announce [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=25.02s)]
*  five major actions to continue to relieve student debt for more than 30 million Americans. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=29.900000000000002s)]
*  President Biden speaking in Wisconsin today announcing a new plan to lower [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  student loan payments for tens of millions of Americans who have student loans. The substance of this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  is straightforward, right? Help people who are drowning under big student loan payments. Our country wants people to go to college, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=47.38s)]
*  so our country should reduce the disincentive [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  to go to college by making it less economically disastrous to do so. People who are having trouble with their student loans [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=56.94s)]
*  relieve that economic pain, make it easier on them. The substance of it is straightforward. The politics of it is straightforward, too, right? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=63.699999999999996s)]
*  Here's the president going to a critical swing state, unveiling a program that he hopes will be particularly popular with young people. Young people, of course, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=70.78s)]
*  particularly crucial for his bid for re-election. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=78.74s)]
*  So the substance is straightforward and important. The politics are straightforward and important for President Biden. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=81.12s)]
*  But just as important are the politics on the other side. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=86.04s)]
*  Republicans already sued and successfully blocked one of President Biden's plans for forgiving student loans. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=89.12s)]
*  After President Biden pivoted to use a different program to forgive more student loans, Republicans sued to stop that one, too. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=95.28s)]
*  Now, President Biden has announced this latest plan to reduce student debt for more than 30 million Americans. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=101.08s)]
*  Now, President Biden has announced this latest plan today in Wisconsin. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  And so new Republican lawsuits against that one are expected any minute as well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=112.82s)]
*  And just think about what that means. Just like step back from that for a second. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=118.06s)]
*  Republicans are suing over and over again in multiple states. Republicans are suing to make sure that Americans have to pay more in student loans, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=122.22s)]
*  to make sure that you have to pay more interest to banks on your student loans. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=132.56s)]
*  That is what they are offering America in this election year. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=139.6s)]
*  Isn't that what America most needs for banks to make more money off people who took out loans to go to college? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=142.2s)]
*  Isn't that really, you know, morally, isn't that a real justice issue for America? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=148.84s)]
*  Everything is so personality driven and the way we talk about politics, it sometimes just doesn't get covered. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=156.44s)]
*  But what the Republicans are offering in terms of policy right now, what they're actually doing in places where they have power, it's all stuff like this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=162.24s)]
*  I mean, they really are trying desperately in a concerted effort across multiple Republican controlled states. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=170.24s)]
*  They are trying as hard as they can to make you pay more to the banks for your student loans. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=175.8s)]
*  In states where they are in power, they are repealing child labor laws. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  Because yeah, American voters are desperate for a solution to our long national nightmare of children not being allowed to work overnights in super dangerous jobs. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=187.54s)]
*  This, the most influential group of Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives just officially proposed raising the retirement age for Social Security. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=198.26s)]
*  Because surely it's a huge problem in America that we're not forcing our elderly to work into more of their senior most years before they can collect their Social Security. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=207.18s)]
*  Raising the retirement age. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=218.34s)]
*  They're also still crusading against in vitro fertilization. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=220.58s)]
*  The Republican study group in the House still pushing against IVF and still pushing for a national abortion ban, even in the blue states. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  Right? On top of the draconian state bans that they've already put into place in almost every state in the country where Republicans are in control. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=232.3s)]
*  This is not a popular suite of policy proposals and policy options from the Republican Party. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=239.66s)]
*  The things that Republicans are setting themselves up against are supported by 70, 80, 90 percent of Americans in some cases. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=245.8s)]
*  So yeah, if I were them, I'd prefer personality driven politics coverage as well. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2TWDmLx_dI&t=254.52s)]
