# New Reporting On Weapons Among January 6th Mob Amplifies Severity Of Attack
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o)
*  AR-15s, shotguns, tons of pistols, semi-automatic handguns, also bear spray, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=0.0s)]
*  chemical spray, stun guns, flagpoles, spears, flagpoles made into spears, clubs, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=6.48s)]
*  collapsible batons, bulletproof vests, crossbows, machetes, smoke grenades, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=14.4s)]
*  thousands of rounds of ammunition ranging from shotgun shells to hollow [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=19.92s)]
*  point bullets. Plus the nightmare homemade stuff like these mason jars [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  filled with gasoline and styrofoam. Basically do-it-yourself napalm. Nice [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=28.6s)]
*  that he packed them all together in that tight space. Hit any speed bumps on the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=34.6s)]
*  way? On Friday, just a few days ago, the Washington Post did a public service. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=38.68s)]
*  They sent several reporters to pull from court filings and public reporting all [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=45.6s)]
*  of the different weapons we now know were at the Capitol on January 6th in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=51.16s)]
*  the hands of the pro-Trump mob. The Post reported on 121 people ultimately charged [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=55.8s)]
*  with using or carrying dangerous weapons that day. That reporting of course [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=62.04s)]
*  follows testimony from White House Staffer Cassidy Hutchinson that not only [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=65.88s)]
*  was President Trump warned early on January 6th that the crowds near the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=69.32s)]
*  Capitol were quite heavily armed, that the people choosing to go through the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=72.67999999999999s)]
*  metal detectors had had tons of weapons confiscated from them already, but he was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=76.2s)]
*  warned that the people choosing not to go through the metal detectors were [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=80.8s)]
*  choosing to avoid them, choosing to avoid going through magnetometers in part [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=84.0s)]
*  because they wanted to keep their weapons on them. Trump responded to that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=88.04s)]
*  information, allegedly, by saying that he wanted the metal detectors for his rally [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  taken down so the crowd wouldn't have to have their guns taken away for them to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=96.16s)]
*  be able to attend. Because whoever they wanted to use those weapons against, he [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=101.2s)]
*  figured it wasn't him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  I overheard the president say something to the effect of, you know, I don't f-ing care that they have weapons. They're not here to hurt me. Take the f-ing bags away. Let my people in. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=107.32s)]
*  They're not here to hurt me. Let the people in with weapons. And then we'll go to the Capitol. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=119.32s)]
*  Again, we have known that information for a couple of weeks because of testimony [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=124.32s)]
*  from White House Staffer Cassidy Hutchinson. But that information we can [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=130.16s)]
*  now put in the context of a whole burst of new news about just how armed the crowd [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=134.56s)]
*  was on January 6th. I mean, first we learned from her that Trump knew they were [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=140.56s)]
*  armed. Now we're learning a lot more about how exactly they were armed and how [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=144.84s)]
*  armed they were. I mean, in addition to that Washington Post reporting, which is a [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=150.48s)]
*  real public service, on Friday from the Justice Department, we also got an update [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=154.0s)]
*  in the seditious conspiracy case against the leaders of the Oath Keepers and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  alleged members of that group. U.S. prosecutors laid out a series of revelations [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=163.3s)]
*  about weapons they say those individuals had brought with them to D.C. on January 6th. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=167.02s)]
*  Quote, the government has evidence that members of the group from Florida and Arizona [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=171.58s)]
*  allegedly staged semi-automatic rifles and other weapons in a suburban Washington [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=175.46s)]
*  hotel, while a third team from North Carolina kept their firearms ready to go in a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  vehicle in the parking lot. Quote, another Florida member of the group came to [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=184.82000000000002s)]
*  Washington with explosives in his recreational vehicle, which he left parked [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=188.18s)]
*  in College Park, Maryland. The government later seized from that RV, quote, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=193.18s)]
*  military ordnance grenades. He had them in his RV, which he had used to travel to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=198.18s)]
*  D.C. on January 6th. All of that is information, I think it's worth noting, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  that is all information we did not have the first time anybody tried to hold Trump [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=209.86s)]
*  accountable for what he set off on January 6th. During his second impeachment trial [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=214.78s)]
*  right after January 6th, one of the key pieces we now know was missing was just how [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=219.9s)]
*  armed that crowd was when they stormed the Capitol. That makes this kind of fresh new [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  ground. How does it change the job of the investigators? How does it change the stakes? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=230.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, joining us now is somebody in a unique position. To be able to talk about that, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=235.94s)]
*  Barry Burke was counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during President Trump's first [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  impeachment, the one about Ukraine. Then he was lead counsel in President Trump's second [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=243.18s)]
*  impeachment, which was the one about January 6th. Mr. Burke, it is a real pleasure to have [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=247.46s)]
*  you with us here tonight. Thank you for taking the time. Thank you, Rachel. Great to be here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=251.06s)]
*  Is it fair to say that when Trump was impeached for the January 6th attack, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=255.06s)]
*  again, for which you were lead counsel, is it fair to say that it wasn't yet clear at that time [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=260.66s)]
*  just how many weapons were among the mob that day, how many weapons, what types of weapons they had [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  brought to D.C., let alone the fact that Trump was aware of how armed they were? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=271.66s)]
*  That is all true. This is so much more direct evidence that supports everything we were saying [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=277.18s)]
*  during the impeachment seeking to prove and all the circumstantial evidence that we thought proved [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  it. It also shows the lies to all of Trump's defenses. If you remember, during the impeachment, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=286.54s)]
*  we had him saying to the Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. We had him sending out on December [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=291.18s)]
*  19th the tweet, you know, big protest in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. It will be wild. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=296.94s)]
*  And we had all the other evidence. What this shows is that everything we were saying was true [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=303.98s)]
*  and then some. Of course, he was summoning these violent domestic extremist groups and should have [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=308.54s)]
*  known or would have known that they were violent. When he stood up there, he knew the crowd that he [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=314.62s)]
*  was encouraging because he had received those warnings. Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony was so [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=318.86s)]
*  great because it explained what preceded it and what followed. He knew they had guns but didn't [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=323.26s)]
*  care because they weren't seeking to shoot him. And all these folks came prepared. And there's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=328.06s)]
*  even more evidence of that because they were told the election was being stolen and they were [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=333.34s)]
*  summoned there. And I remember from the second impeachment, one of the most chilling pieces of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=338.38s)]
*  film that I saw when preparing was the film when the people who rated it told the police, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=342.7s)]
*  we're here because the president told us to come here and invited us. And that's what they believe. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=346.94s)]
*  And that's why he is singularly responsible. So it is new evidence and it's powerful, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=351.42s)]
*  further proof of his responsibility for everything that happened and that January 6th was the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  culmination of his attempt to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power after all his other [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=361.5s)]
*  efforts had failed. Now, in terms of the relationship between these pro-Trump fascist [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=366.70000000000005s)]
*  paramilitary groups, members of which have been charged with seditious conspiracy and the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=372.94s)]
*  culpability of the president, Congressman Raskin, who's going to co-lead tomorrow's hearing, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=379.02s)]
*  I know you worked with him closely on Trump's second impeachment, he has said that tomorrow's [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=383.09999999999997s)]
*  hearing is not going to be about showing explicit evidence that Trump approved directly of these [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=387.26s)]
*  paramilitary groups' plans or that he told them to draw up plans like that. He said that isn't what [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=395.65999999999997s)]
*  they're setting out to prove. They're setting out to prove what he described as a convergence [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=400.85999999999996s)]
*  of Trump's efforts and what the paramilitary groups are willing to do with weapons and with [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  violence. Can you help us understand what that means? He's not talking about there being [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=412.29999999999995s)]
*  coincidentally pursuing the same idea. He's talking about there being converged efforts. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=417.34s)]
*  Absolutely. And I think I can't help but look at this as a trial lawyer because it's so effective [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=423.41999999999996s)]
*  to have Cassidy Hutchinson come in as the last witness, say she heard Proud Boys, Oath Keepers [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=428.53999999999996s)]
*  mentioned in connection with January 6th. They knew they were warned there was going to be [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=434.46s)]
*  violence. They knew and he was warned not to use the words to encourage the crowd to fight. And yet [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=438.38s)]
*  he sent out that December 19th tweet telling him to be there and be wild. He knew what he was coming. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=445.9s)]
*  So they're not going to say that he may have had direct conversations with the Oath Keepers or the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  Proud Boys, but it was all happening in real time. At the same time, he was trying to influence state [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  officials telling him to find the exact amount of votes he needed to win, trying to get his senior [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=463.1s)]
*  DOJ officials just to say, just say there's fraud and he'll take care of the rest. It was clear that [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=468.3s)]
*  these efforts were part of that broader scheme. So I think what Jamie, who's the best, was trying [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=473.74s)]
*  to say is they may not need to show and they won't show a direct communications, but they don't need [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=477.98s)]
*  to because the proof is overwhelming that these were all part of the same effort to prevent the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=482.62s)]
*  peaceful transfer of power to interfere with the work of Congress. And he shouldn't have been [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=488.06s)]
*  surprised that when you're reaching out telling the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=493.18s)]
*  when you know these folks are hearing your messages, that they will be armed and heavily [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=497.98s)]
*  armed. He just didn't care because they weren't there to harm him. Yeah, it was a unified, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=502.14000000000004s)]
*  holistic effort where everybody was aware of the other elements of the effort. And one of the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=507.82s)]
*  elements of the effort were heavily armed, paramilitary trained, fascist groups, you know, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=513.5s)]
*  just another day at the office. Barry Burke. I think it's so important because it adds the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=520.38s)]
*  violence to it that he knew. And that's something that the American people can understand. The [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=527.18s)]
*  violent overthrow of government is something that we've never seen, let alone by a president [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=531.66s)]
*  of the United States. So to see those efforts, I think really speaks volumes and it will be a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=535.82s)]
*  continuation of that tomorrow at the hearings. Barry Burke was lead counsel for Trump's second [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=539.98s)]
*  impeachment on these matters. Barry, thank you for helping us at the stage for that tomorrow. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=545.42s)]
*  It's really great to have you here. Thanks. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=549.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZvRD3Y-i_o&t=569.9s)]
