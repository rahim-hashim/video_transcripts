# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 9
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI)
*  Joining me now is the former United States Ambassador to Ukraine, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=0.0s)]
*  Marie Jovanovich. Her new book, Lessons from the Edge, comes out next week. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=3.34s)]
*  You know a lot of people in Ukraine. What are you hearing from them? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=7.0s)]
*  What are they telling you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=11.44s)]
*  Well, it's across the board. I mean, it's disbelief, it's anguish, it's cries for help. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=14.24s)]
*  But I'm also hearing the resolute nature of the Ukrainian people, what you are seeing, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  you know, in living rooms and online every day. The Ukrainian people do not give up. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=26.2s)]
*  I've been in touch with somebody in the Ukrainian government who's quite high up, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=32.84s)]
*  and he's working, you know, seven floors down in a bunker. He says there's no light, there's no air, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=37.4s)]
*  there are only government people and security people. And he talks about the difference [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=45.32s)]
*  between life down there and life on the surface. But he says we are motivated, we are going to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=50.2s)]
*  fight for Ukraine. And on the surface, as he calls it, you can see all the people of Ukraine, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=55.08s)]
*  ordinary citizens like you and me, who are setting about defending their country from this brutal [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=61.56s)]
*  invasion. What do you think Vladimir Putin's end goal is here? At first, it was to extend an [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=67.72s)]
*  umbrella of protection to Russian speakers in Ukraine. We knew that wasn't true. Then it was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=76.84s)]
*  to replace the government with a one that once again was friendlier to Russia than to the West. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=81.48s)]
*  But now this just looks like a campaign of destruction. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=88.04s)]
*  It does. It looks like a campaign of vengeance because it was not the cakewalk that he was [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=93.16s)]
*  anticipating. I do think that Putin has had an obsession with Ukraine for many years. He's made [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=99.16s)]
*  that clear in his writings and in his actions. He invaded Georgia in 2008. He invaded Ukraine in [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=106.12s)]
*  2014, as you recounted. And he got away with both of those actions. And I think he thought he was [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=115.0s)]
*  going to get away with it again, that Ukraine would not be able to put up the kind of resistance that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  we are seeing, both on the part of the military, as well as the government and the citizens of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=126.04s)]
*  Ukraine. And I think he badly underestimated that the reaction of the international community, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=131.08s)]
*  that we would be united in the face of what can only be called depravity. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=138.52s)]
*  Is there a world in which the Ukrainian people win this fight? We've been speaking to members [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  of parliament who say they've got the drive in them to do it, but they cannot do it without [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  more assistance from the globe. Do you see there's any chance of Ukraine prevailing? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=156.44s)]
*  I think, here's what I know. Russia is not going to prevail. Russia may, over time, if it really [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=161.08s)]
*  doubles down, they may win the war, but they are never going to win the peace. Because the Ukrainian [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=171.56s)]
*  people will resist, as you are seeing them do every day right now. They will resist through a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=178.44s)]
*  guerrilla movement. They will resist through acts of civil disobedience. They will make the price so [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=185.32s)]
*  high for a Russian occupation that it will not be sustainable. Russia's miscalculation in invading [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=192.44s)]
*  Ukraine is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian nation, but it is also a tragedy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=200.28s)]
*  for the Russian people whose future is now being mortgaged by the blood and treasure that Russia [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=207.24s)]
*  is expending in Ukraine. I want to ask you about this no-fly zone, whether it's a full one that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=212.76s)]
*  the Ukrainian president is looking for or the one I just spoke to Ambassador Herbst about, a narrower [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  one. What do you believe the likelihood of something like that happening is and what do you think [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  the U.S. administration should be doing? Yeah, I think it's a very important question to ask. I think [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=231.16s)]
*  we need to ask ourselves as the international community, how do we help Ukraine? How do we [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=238.76s)]
*  support Ukraine? How do we save Ukraine without expanding the war in ways nobody wants to see? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=245.23999999999998s)]
*  On the one hand, I think that nobody wants to push Putin over the edge. But on the other hand, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  what does it say about us and our values if we don't provide greater military assistance? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=260.76s)]
*  We have the means to stop or at least mitigate some of the worst carnage. And as your previous [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=269.4s)]
*  guest said, will we at some later point have to intervene at a time that is perhaps more difficult? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=278.12s)]
*  I think this question of risk is a very important one. We need to mitigate the risk, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=285.64s)]
*  but it's also true that not taking greater action comes with a risk as well, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  because Putin is a bully and he only understands strength. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=301.08s)]
*  I'm joined once again by the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Ambassador, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=306.44s)]
*  thank you for waiting and for being with us. Colonel Alexander Vindman was on the show earlier [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=311.64s)]
*  this week. He essentially told me that he believes there's a direct line between what happened on that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  July 2019 phone call between Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky and what we're seeing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=321.96s)]
*  now. He believes that Donald Trump weakened Zelensky by withholding a White House meeting [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=327.88s)]
*  and the military aid at the exact time that Zelensky, who was a new and untried president, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=333.24s)]
*  needed it the most. Two and a half years later, how damaging was that whole incident in which [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=338.28s)]
*  you also became involved to the standing and potential success of President Zelensky in [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  Ukraine right now? Well, there's no question that that whole series of events really damaged the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=349.64s)]
*  trust between the two countries. Zelensky had been, you know, not a politician. He had been a comedian [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=357.08s)]
*  and this was one of his very first experiences in international relations. And, you know, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=363.64s)]
*  he said publicly after that he didn't really trust any other countries. So it was quite damaging. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=368.36s)]
*  But even more so, I think when the transcripts were released, others like President Putin [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=374.12s)]
*  could see the contempt with which President Trump was dealing with President Zelensky. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=382.12s)]
*  And I think that in itself was very damaging. And more broadly, the whole world could see [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=390.28s)]
*  that the president of the United States was ready to trade our national security interests [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=396.84s)]
*  for his own personal and political gain. Hugely, hugely damaging because you have, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=403.47999999999996s)]
*  you know, everybody who is so inclined wanting to jump onto the gravy train. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=410.67999999999995s)]
*  So, yeah, I would say it was a very damaging incident. But fast forward to today, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=414.84s)]
*  Zelensky, President Zelensky, you know, has made the transition from comedian to president of a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  developing democracy to a war hero, a man who is inspiring not only his own country, but the world. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=430.44s)]
*  Tell me about this effort that you were involved in to fight corruption in Ukraine and try and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=437.64s)]
*  get it to a place where it could join the European Union and ultimately NATO. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=443.16s)]
*  Well, that was U.S. policy and it was also Ukrainian policy following the Revolution of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=448.20000000000005s)]
*  Dignity in 2014. And what that term means, it's kind of an obscure term for Americans, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=453.88000000000005s)]
*  but what it means is rule of law. Ukrainians were tired of having one set of rules for the oligarchs [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=459.8s)]
*  and leaders of the country where they could do whatever they wanted. And ordinary people [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=467.32000000000005s)]
*  had to do, had to follow the laws and were often, you know, the victims of corrupt efforts to shake [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=471.64s)]
*  them down and so forth. People were sick of it. And they mounted the street demonstrations [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=478.52s)]
*  because they wanted to join the EU when the previous pro-Russian president had not, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=486.59999999999997s)]
*  had turned his back on that. And it turned into the Revolution of Dignity. And so there was a, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=492.36s)]
*  a President Poroshenko came in and there was a very clear policy on the part of the Ukrainian [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=497.96s)]
*  government and pro-reform activists and politicians that they wanted to turn the country around, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=504.04s)]
*  get a hold of corruption, move forward on their democratic efforts and create the rule of law in [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=512.28s)]
*  Ukraine. And we wanted to support that. We thought that that would be terrific for Ukraine, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=519.56s)]
*  a country after all of 44 million people in the heart of Europe. And we thought it would be good [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=524.76s)]
*  for us as well to have a strong democratic country as a partner in that part of Europe. So we all [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  were working quite hard to support the efforts of the Ukrainians in that direction. And I think [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=541.24s)]
*  Zelensky certainly in his first pro-reform government was working in that direction. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=547.16s)]
*  I need to say that reforms in any country, whether it's in the US, Ukraine or a third country, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=552.12s)]
*  they go in fits and starts. It's never a straight line. So the Ukrainians have made progress since [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=559.24s)]
*  2014. They have made progress since Zelensky came to power, but it's not in a straight line. And I [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=566.2800000000001s)]
*  think the Ukrainian people are still hoping for more progress in that area. But I think the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=573.48s)]
*  the entire country, the entire political spectrum is united behind President Zelensky to fight the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=579.8000000000001s)]
*  common foe, which is Russia. Yeah, it's important to remember that no country is a monolith and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=586.12s)]
*  Ukraine has its own politics inside of it. But right now they are united around this. A final [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=593.48s)]
*  comment from you, a final thought from you. You knew of Volodymyr Zelensky when he first became [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=598.84s)]
*  president. Most Americans had never heard the name. He was a young man. He's 44 years old [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=604.76s)]
*  right now. And as recently as a month ago, there were Western leaders saying this guy's not up to [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=613.0s)]
*  the challenge of going up against the master manipulator, Vladimir Putin. What has Volodymyr [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=617.4s)]
*  Zelensky done that has impressed you in the last several weeks? Well, I've been very impressed by [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=624.28s)]
*  how he has used his communication skills as an actor, as a comedian, and his executive skills [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=632.52s)]
*  as the head of a large media empire. And now, you know, the president of a large country in [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  the heart of Europe, he has combined those two talents to communicate with his people [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=646.68s)]
*  in a time of great stress and peril, unite the Ukrainian people behind him, and inspire the world. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=652.6s)]
*  He has, you know, the man has met the moment. He is a true Ukrainian hero right now. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=660.6s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you for your time tonight. We really appreciate it. Former ambassador to Ukraine, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=667.8000000000001s)]
*  Maria Ivanovich, is the author of a new memoir called Lessons from the Edge. It was yesterday [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=672.6s)]
*  that Poland offered to send all of its MiG-29 jets, Russian-made jets, to Ukraine via a U.S. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=679.48s)]
*  air base in Germany. One top U.S. official called the announcement a, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=687.0s)]
*  quote, surprise move. Well, today, the Pentagon spokesman made it clear the idea was a non-starter. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=690.8399999999999s)]
*  Secretary Austin thanked the minister for Poland's willingness to continue to look for ways to assist [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=698.92s)]
*  Ukraine. But he stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=705.48s)]
*  the Ukrainian Air Force at this time and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody either. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=709.96s)]
*  But at this time, we believe the provision of additional fighter aircraft provides [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=716.6s)]
*  little increased capabilities at high risk. We also believe that there are alternative options [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=721.32s)]
*  that are much better suited to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=728.6s)]
*  and we will continue to pursue those options. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=732.6800000000001s)]
*  All right. So the U.S. says it won't give Ukraine the planes that they've urgently asked for [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=735.32s)]
*  and that there are alternative options. But the world is asking, what are those options? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=744.5200000000001s)]
*  Well, here's one that's being proposed in an open letter signed by 27 foreign policy experts. Quote, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=749.48s)]
*  we urge the Biden administration, together with NATO allies, to impose a limited no-fly zone [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=755.0s)]
*  over Ukraine, starting with protection for humanitarian corridors that were agreed upon [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=762.12s)]
*  in talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials. What we seek is the deployment of American and [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=767.0s)]
*  NATO aircraft not in search of confrontation with Russia, but to avert and deter Russian [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=773.88s)]
*  bombardment that would result in massive loss of Ukrainian lives. End quote. Joining us now is one [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=780.04s)]
*  of the experts who signed that letter, John Herbst, former United States Ambassador to Ukraine. He's [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=786.36s)]
*  currently director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council. Ambassador, good evening. Thank [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=791.4s)]
*  you for making time to be with us tonight. Let's talk about this. The world is looking at this, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=795.8s)]
*  and they don't really understand a disagreement between America and Poland about these particular [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=801.16s)]
*  planes. They are watching a humanitarian disaster unfold, and they want to know what can actually [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=806.68s)]
*  be done. You and 26 others have proposed something very specific. Please tell us about it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=812.6s)]
*  Correct. Look, it's very simple. Moscow's two-week-old offensive against Ukraine [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=818.52s)]
*  has largely bogged down. Putin is frustrated. When his campaign in Syria, which he began [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=825.96s)]
*  in the fall of 2015, did not produce results, after several months, he went to massive bombardment. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=833.0s)]
*  There's a risk he'll do that now, and he's already bombarded residential areas in Kharkiv. If he does [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=840.84s)]
*  that, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians will die. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=846.92s)]
*  The idea that we're proposing is to establish not necessarily a no-fly zone, but an area [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=853.0s)]
*  where Russian planes will not be able to bomb civilians. That's the basic idea. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=858.36s)]
*  When you said a limited or contained no-fly zone, what would that look like over the country? Who [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=865.4s)]
*  determines to what it is limited? Well, we would make it determinate. We, the U.S. government, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=869.7199999999999s)]
*  and with our NATO allies, would make a determination. It would look at areas where [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=875.4s)]
*  civilians are trying to get out of war zones, where we know the Russians have blocked the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=879.8s)]
*  establishment of real humanitarian corridors. It would certainly operate in the West and around [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=883.3199999999999s)]
*  Kiev. It might operate further East, where, again, civilians are subject to daily bombardment, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=888.28s)]
*  and the Russians are not letting them leave. We would not, unlike a regular fly zone, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=892.76s)]
*  initiate any action against Russian or any other forces. We would be there to make sure that action [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=897.56s)]
*  is not taken against innocent civilians. This seems to have been rejected fairly quickly out [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=903.16s)]
*  of hand. You regret that that's the case. You think that there's more creative thinking to be [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=908.76s)]
*  had between the United States and NATO. The rejection of this out of hand, just like the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=913.24s)]
*  unfortunate decision by the Biden administration on the warplanes to Ukraine, suggests timidity, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=918.1999999999999s)]
*  suggests the United States thinks that somehow we have to avoid provoking Putin. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=926.6s)]
*  Putin, who's just been escalating massively in Ukraine, for us to simply send those weapons to [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=930.6s)]
*  Ukraine so we can defend himself is the normal decision. To say we can't do it because it's [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=936.44s)]
*  escalatory suggests fear. Putin has a fine nose for detecting fear, and that just emboldens him [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=940.04s)]
*  to be more aggressive. We've seen a very sad week in American statesmanship regarding the rejection [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=946.44s)]
*  out of hand of this limited no-fly zone and the rejection of these warplanes to a country which [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=953.48s)]
*  is defending itself against a much stronger neighbor. Ambassador, the things that are starting [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=958.52s)]
*  to look like war crimes, the potential deliberate targeting of civilians, the attacks on hospitals, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=965.0799999999999s)]
*  does that change the way the United States and the world should be looking at this, that this is [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=971.96s)]
*  becoming a humanitarian catastrophe that we need to get involved in to solve and we need to maybe [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=976.04s)]
*  make the idea of getting into a conflict with Russia of secondary importance? Of course you're [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=981.0s)]
*  right. That's what makes those decisions this week so short-sighted. The American public [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=987.4s)]
*  overwhelmingly supports Ukraine facing this massive aggression from Moscow. If in fact Moscow moves [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=994.28s)]
*  to this massive bombardment, the public's going to be calling for us to do more. We saw the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1001.64s)]
*  president, President Biden, last week reject stopping oil purchases from Russia. Then under [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1006.92s)]
*  congressional and public pressure, he changed his mind. This may well happen again. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1012.4399999999999s)]
*  Of once Moscow begins a campaign which murders tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1017.0s)]
*  we may be forced to act precisely along the lines that my 26 colleagues suggested. We should not be [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1023.64s)]
*  saying no to an object, to a proposal which would save those lives. Again, what we've done by taking [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1030.52s)]
*  these two off the table, if only temporarily, we're conveying to Moscow that we can be intimidated. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1038.2s)]
*  That's a very dangerous thing with a man like Putin. We are far more powerful than Russia. We [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1043.72s)]
*  need to remember that we're a superpower and that Putin has to worry about us at least as much, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1048.44s)]
*  if not more, than we have to worry about him. That should undergird our diplomacy and our [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1053.3200000000002s)]
*  national security policy in this crisis. Thank you. Ambassador, we appreciate your time tonight. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1059.8000000000002s)]
*  John Herbst is the former United States Ambassador to Ukraine, the current director of the Eurasia [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1066.44s)]
*  Center at the Atlantic Council. Here in Zahon, Hungary, this is a way station where people who've [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1071.08s)]
*  made it out of Ukraine are waiting for their next train, which is that train by the way, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1079.32s)]
*  that'll leave very shortly for Budapest, to take them further down the line. Just before we got on [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1084.1999999999998s)]
*  air, I met two women whose young children were fast asleep, not realizing that they are out of [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1088.84s)]
*  harm's way. Here's a little bit of the conversation I had. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1095.4s)]
*  My boy, his name is Andrei. He is my girl, Lisa name. And how old are they? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1100.44s)]
*  Almost seven. Both of them? Yes. Yes. Okay. Where are you coming from? We're from Ukraine, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1113.88s)]
*  Zhytomyr. Where's that? Near Kiev. Okay. And who have you brought and who is behind? Who's left behind? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1121.0s)]
*  I'm with my friend. And you are Alina? Yes, yes, it's my friend. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1138.2s)]
*  My husband, my husband, my father, my sister. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1150.76s)]
*  Stay. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1160.3600000000001s)]
*  Are your kids scared? Do they know what's happening? They know and I think they [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1164.92s)]
*  don't understand all this. It's very scared and we can [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1175.16s)]
*  cannot get over the shock that we get. It's very scared and I can't sleep at night. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1183.8799999999999s)]
*  Final stop for those two women and their two seven-year-old children will be in Prague, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1195.96s)]
*  in the Czech Republic. They'll go first to Budapest and then they'll go on to Prague. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJlm_F6KHdI&t=1200.68s)]
