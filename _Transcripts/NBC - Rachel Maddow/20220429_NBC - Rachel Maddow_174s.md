# Trump Pardon Fails To Keep Manafort Out Of Legal Trouble
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg)
*  When Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, he hired as his campaign chairman this guy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=0.0s)]
*  Paul Manafort. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  It will never not be an absolutely crazy thing that our last president chose as his campaign [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  chair, a guy who had spent the past many years in Ukraine working for a pro-Putin political [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=11.96s)]
*  party and helping install a Kremlin-friendly autocrat as Ukraine's president. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  The reason Paul Manafort was available to run Donald Trump's campaign was that the people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=22.36s)]
*  of Ukraine had finally risen up in revolution and that pro-Putin autocrat Manafort's boss [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=26.74s)]
*  had fled to Russia. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=31.979999999999997s)]
*  That democratic revolution in Ukraine sparked Vladimir Putin's invasion and annexation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=33.699999999999996s)]
*  of Crimea and everything that came after. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  We are all still living through the historical consequences of Paul Manafort's Ukraine misadventures. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=40.48s)]
*  But what Manafort got out of those years working for the pro-Putin political party in Ukraine [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  was money, lots and lots of money. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=51.14s)]
*  And in 2018, Manafort was convicted of using secret foreign accounts to hide the tens of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=54.08s)]
*  millions of dollars he made. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=59.46s)]
*  He also pled guilty to money laundering and obstruction. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=61.14s)]
*  He served two years of a seven and a half year prison sentence, but then he was pardoned [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=64.66s)]
*  by President Trump just before he left office. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=69.14s)]
*  Of course he was. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=71.46s)]
*  And he even got back a bunch of the real estate he'd had to forfeit as part of his conviction. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=72.46s)]
*  Real estate he'd bought with those ill-gotten gains. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=77.36s)]
*  He recently sold his Hamptons mansion for more than $10 million. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=80.86s)]
*  Not a bad deal. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=84.56s)]
*  But here is a plot twist we did not see coming. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=86.28s)]
*  You may recall that when Manafort was convicted on eight felony counts back in 2018, there [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=89.72s)]
*  were another ten charges on which the jury could not reach a verdict. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=94.24s)]
*  The judge in the case declared a mistrial on those ten counts. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=97.98s)]
*  Well, the Justice Department appears to have decided that those counts are not covered [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=101.24s)]
*  by Trump's pardon. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=105.3s)]
*  That Trump pardon applies only to the stuff Manafort was convicted for or pled guilty [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=106.94s)]
*  to. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=111.88s)]
*  Because yesterday the Justice Department filed a brand new civil suit against Paul Manafort [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=112.88s)]
*  over some of those secret foreign bank accounts where he hid his millions from all his work [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=117.08s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=122.0s)]
*  Accounts for which he was never convicted. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  The Justice Department says Manafort owes the US government almost $3 million in penalties [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=125.88s)]
*  for hiding those accounts. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=130.72s)]
*  Penalties the government has been trying to collect from Manafort for the last two years. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=132.68s)]
*  And now they are asking a court to make him pay up. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=136.42s)]
*  Trump's pardon looked like it put an end to Manafort's accountability for hiding all that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=140.02s)]
*  money he made doing pro-Putin dirty work in Ukraine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=143.46s)]
*  Now it looks like the US justice system might not quite be finished with Paul Manafort. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmP4f3aT1sg&t=147.18s)]
