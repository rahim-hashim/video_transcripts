# Ambiguity In Garland Speech Leaves Scope Of DOJ Focus A Mystery
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw)
*  Attorney General Merrick Arlen today explaining that 150 misdemeanor cases have already been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=0.0s)]
*  resolved related to people who took part in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=5.64s)]
*  Those have already been resolved with defendants pleading guilty. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  He said 17 felony defendants are already scheduled for trial. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=12.68s)]
*  More than 300 other people are today stand indicted on felony charges. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=16.36s)]
*  He's laying all that out, as you just heard there, to make the case that small fry defendants [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=21.44s)]
*  always go first. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=26.68s)]
*  That's on purpose. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=27.8s)]
*  People who did worse crimes, less overtly obvious crimes, they come later, in part because [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=29.08s)]
*  the easier to prosecute stuff often provides evidence that you can use in other cases. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=34.48s)]
*  Helpful. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=40.68s)]
*  But still, the basic question remains. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=43.32s)]
*  Is he only talking about crimes that were physically committed at the U.S. Capitol building [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  on January 6th between the hours of 2 p.m. and dinner time that day, a year ago tomorrow? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=50.68s)]
*  Or does this investigation include, is there a criminal investigation into those who hatched [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=57.28s)]
*  the overall plot, not the plot to break windows and smear poop on the walls, the plot to stop [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  the electoral count and keep Trump in power? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=68.6s)]
*  Because that's what all the January 6th folks were doing in Washington. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=71.22s)]
*  They believed they were part of a larger plot, and indeed they were. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=74.66s)]
*  And lots of people are happily confessing now to having been part of that larger plot [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=78.32s)]
*  or to witnessing it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=82.32s)]
*  When the president tried to enlist them in it, what BJ Pack saw them try to do in Georgia, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=83.92s)]
*  what Peter Navarro was happily confessing to live on MSNBC on a Tuesday night, what [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=88.8s)]
*  Trump and his colleagues did to try to get the mob to D.C. on January 6th in the first [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=93.04s)]
*  place, because January 6th was the counting of the electoral votes and they needed to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=97.52s)]
*  stop that count so the electors could be switched in the states, which was the rest of the plan. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  What about that rest of the plan? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=107.8s)]
*  Was that cool? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  Getting Republican state legislatures whatever gossamer or false pretext they needed to throw [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=111.8s)]
*  out election results and instead replace them with, we're just going to say Trump won. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=117.6s)]
*  Because that was a real plan and we know a lot more about that plan today than we did [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=123.5s)]
*  a year ago. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  Did Attorney General Merrick Garland today let the country know if that other part of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=130.4s)]
*  it was okay? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=135.5s)]
*  We know they're prosecuting people who broke windows and did bad stuff in the Capitol. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=137.58s)]
*  Did he let the country know today whether the rest of it, the rest of the plot to overthrow [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=142.46s)]
*  the U.S. government was all right and anybody who did that is free to try again? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=147.38000000000002s)]
*  And I am phrasing this as a question because I honestly don't know. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=152.3s)]
*  What do you take away from how he said this today? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  As judges have sentenced the first defendants convicted of assaults and related violent [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  conduct against officers, we have seen significant sentences that reflect the seriousness of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=166.34s)]
*  those offenses, both in terms of the injuries they caused and the serious risk they posed [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=172.58s)]
*  to our democratic institutions. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=179.72s)]
*  The actions we have taken thus far will not be our last. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators at any [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=189.98s)]
*  level accountable under law, whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=197.17999999999998s)]
*  responsible for the assault on our democracy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=204.62s)]
*  We will follow the facts wherever they lead. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  The Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators at any [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=213.33999999999997s)]
*  level accountable under law, whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=219.5s)]
*  responsible for the assault on our democracy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=223.26s)]
*  Otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=226.94s)]
*  People who are otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on the Capitol, January 6th? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=230.74s)]
*  Or does he mean people who are otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=236.46s)]
*  as in the assault on the election and its results, the effort to falsify those results [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  and thereby seize power? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=244.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=246.36s)]
*  I don't know what he means. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUTbB-V8aw&t=248.26s)]
