# ‘We beat Donald Trump’: E. Jean Carroll and lawyers on Trump's fallibility
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg)
*  I wasn't going to ask this, but... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=0.0s)]
*  And it may be rude, so you don't have to answer if you don't want. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=1.6s)]
*  I'll put this either to Ms. Crowley or Ms. Kaplan, if either of you wants to field it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=4.32s)]
*  You are both very experienced trial attorneys. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  You've been up against some of the best and brightest opposing counsel [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=10.24s)]
*  in all sorts of different trials. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=14.52s)]
*  How is President Trump's lawyering? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=16.4s)]
*  Is he well represented in court? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to let Crowley answer that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=23.92s)]
*  But I will say that what you heard just now in that tape of Alina Jaba leaving the court [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=25.52s)]
*  and kind of yelling at the reporters, that's what we heard every single day, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=33.84s)]
*  multiple times during this trial, but yelling at the judge. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=39.04s)]
*  And it was unbelievably nerve-racking each time it happened, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=43.08s)]
*  and it happens multiple times every day. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=50.44s)]
*  Thanks for handing that one over to me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  I think that she had a hard job, and you could definitely see a difference [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=55.32s)]
*  between her sort of style when he was in the courtroom and when he was not there. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=62.68s)]
*  She was much more disciplined and frankly acted more like a lawyer when he wasn't there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  When he was, I mean, you could hear him telling her when to object and muttering things [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=75.4s)]
*  and, you know, loudly being frustrated with her. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=80.0s)]
*  And I think she felt like she had to say things to the judge and to us [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  and sort of put on a performance like you just saw in front of the TV cameras. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=87.56s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  E. Jean, in terms of what you've just been through, I mean, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=93.48s)]
*  to hear a lawyer as experienced as Robbie Kaplan say it was nerve-racking to be in that room sometimes [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=97.64s)]
*  because of the way this was conducted, I have to ask you, you know, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  President Trump has kept your name out of his mouth since being told he has to pay $83 million to you [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=106.04s)]
*  for what he's done in the past, but over the weekend, he did start posting links online [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=111.72000000000001s)]
*  to articles that attacked you and denied your claims. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  Again, he seems to be pushing it already in terms of whether or not he is going to go back [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=120.76s)]
*  to calling you a liar and denying that he did what he did. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=125.72000000000001s)]
*  If it came to it, if your lawyers told you that there was another case [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=130.08s)]
*  and that you should go back and get more money out of him soon again, would you do it? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=134.12s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=139.28s)]
*  It wasn't too much wear and tear on you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=144.4s)]
*  I mean, the guts factor here is real in terms of how much you put yourself out there. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=148.24s)]
*  Rachel, Rachel. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=153.12s)]
*  A lot of big, strong people have been putting themselves, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=154.44s)]
*  wouldn't put themselves through what you've gone through. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=156.36s)]
*  Rachel, many people, as you know, have been through much worse than I went through at that trial. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=158.52s)]
*  People suffered more difficult things than I've ever been through in my life. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=165.32s)]
*  And I am more than willing to do it again because we achieved so much in a seven-day trial. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=171.92s)]
*  We did what people thought was impossible. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=181.12s)]
*  We beat Donald Trump. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=184.88s)]
*  Let me ask you about a way that you have talked about this, E. Jean. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=190.6s)]
*  You have talked about the fact that this was not just you being passively victimized, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=194.6s)]
*  but you fought that it was a fight. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=202.68s)]
*  And that's the term that you used. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=205.16s)]
*  And everybody gets to choose their own terms to describe it as something like this happening to them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  But you chose that term, and it seems like it's important to your sense of self [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=213.04s)]
*  and your own sense of agency and knowing who you are and making decisions about what to do next. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=218.56s)]
*  What you just did 25 years after the assault was a different kind of fight, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=224.84s)]
*  going at him at the height of his power and the height of his celebrity. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=229.56s)]
*  And I wondered if you could just talk about that self-conception and why it's important to you [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=233.48s)]
*  to know for yourself that you fought, but also so that the world knows [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=238.12s)]
*  that you both did fight and that you will fight. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=242.12s)]
*  Well, we're fighting not really, Rachel, for me. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  It's now about fighting for all women. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=249.48s)]
*  We're also fighting and we salute the women and men who've been assaulted and who did not survive. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=251.8s)]
*  We are doing this for women around the country who have been knocked down repeatedly. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=261.24s)]
*  So it's really not about me anymore. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=270.6s)]
*  We have moved beyond me. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=272.6s)]
*  And as you say, the fight now is really to take back our future. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=274.52s)]
*  This is a man who stacked the Supreme Court, took away women's rights over their own bodies. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=279.56s)]
*  We would like to be a part of turning our eyes to the future and taking back our rights. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  You've talked about using some of Trump's money that you're about to get [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=296.6s)]
*  to help shore up women's rights. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=300.92s)]
*  Do you know what that might be, what that might look like? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes, Rachel. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=306.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=307.72s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=307.96s)]
*  I have such great ideas for all the good I'm going to do with this money. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=308.68s)]
*  First thing, Rachel, you and I are going to go shopping. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=315.32s)]
*  We're going to get completely new wardrobes, new shoes, motorcycle for Crowley, new fishing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=319.0s)]
*  rod for Robbie. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=324.92s)]
*  Rachel, what do you want? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=326.04s)]
*  Penthouse? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=327.0s)]
*  It's yours, Rachel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  Penthouse and France? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=329.88s)]
*  You want France? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  You want to go fishing in France? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=333.08s)]
*  No? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=334.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=335.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=336.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=337.0s)]
*  That's a joke. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=337.64s)]
*  Although if me fishing in France could do something for women's rights, I would take [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  the hit. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=345.8s)]
*  I would obviously take one for the team. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=346.52s)]
*  I would too. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=351.0s)]
*  Let me... [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=351.24s)]
*  As if. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=353.32s)]
*  As if you need persuasion in that regard. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=353.96000000000004s)]
*  Let me finish with a final question. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=356.36s)]
*  Again, this is both for you, Sean, and for you, Robbie. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=358.44s)]
*  You guys can divide up responsibility here. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=361.0s)]
*  But there are multiple cases here involving Trump that are coming up. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=363.24s)]
*  Obviously, most eyes are on the federal January 6th case, having been up against Trump in [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=367.48s)]
*  the courtroom. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=374.04s)]
*  I'm wondering if you two have any advice in terms of what it's like to go up against [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=374.76s)]
*  him and his legal team in terms of the way that he approaches his defense. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=378.6s)]
*  That's part of it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=381.16s)]
*  But I also want to know if this big, what everybody's expecting potentially to be a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=382.20000000000005s)]
*  very large judgment against him and his company, changed anything about the way that you approached [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=386.04s)]
*  ask to the jury, the way that you presented evidence, the way that you're planning on [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=392.76s)]
*  making sure this money is, in fact, extracted from Trump's wallet. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=396.76s)]
*  How much do all of these different cases interact with each other, if at all? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=400.36s)]
*  And can various lawyers involved in various, in these various cases learn from each other's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=403.8s)]
*  experience? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=408.28s)]
*  So the short answer to, do the cases all interact with each other, is absolutely all the time. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=410.2s)]
*  To give you just one good example, in our case, we played at the end of our case, not only the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=416.44s)]
*  deposition that I took of Donald Trump in this case, but we played the deposition that the New [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=422.6s)]
*  York attorney general took in their case, because in that deposition, Trump is bragging about how [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=429.0s)]
*  he's, his brand alone is worth more than $10 billion. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=435.32000000000005s)]
*  He has $400 million cash on hand. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  And the reason that was so relevant is in assessing how much money to award for punitive [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=442.12s)]
*  damages, the jury is not only allowed to, but supposed to think of the wealth of the defendant. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=446.52000000000004s)]
*  So when we said, when Sean said, give him enough, give enough to E.G. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=452.6s)]
*  to make him stop, they had to think what enough would be for Donald Trump. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=458.20000000000005s)]
*  So the cases in kinds of predictable ways and unpredictable ways are kind of talking to each [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=462.36s)]
*  other all the time. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=469.32000000000005s)]
*  On the first question, you know, I think that one thing that I maybe wasn't prepared for [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=471.72s)]
*  coming into this trial is that when, when Donald Trump is stripped of, you know, all of the press [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=476.76s)]
*  and not at a rally and there's no TV cameras and he sort of has a small group of supporters around [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=484.44s)]
*  him, he's not that scary. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=490.76s)]
*  And he also can be controlled. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=494.12s)]
*  You know, I mean, his antics in the courtroom, we've talked about them. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=495.88s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he did kind of follow the rules. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=499.4s)]
*  Robbie Cross examined him. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=503.4s)]
*  He was in, he was in the witness chair and he only got to answer three questions, I think. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=504.52s)]
*  And he pretty much stayed within the bounds. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=510.68s)]
*  I think when you have a strong judge like Judge Kaplan, who enforces the rules of his courtroom [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=513.88s)]
*  and you have real lawyers, you really can get him to behave sort of. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=520.12s)]
*  And when he is stripped of all of the rallies and the truth socials, he's just a guy. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=525.4s)]
*  I think E. Jean called him the emperor with no clothes. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=531.08s)]
*  That's not my quote, but he definitely is. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=535.32s)]
*  He's not the guy that you see on TV. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=538.84s)]
*  He's just a guy sometimes acting like a petulant toddler, but just a guy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=540.84s)]
*  An American bound by the law, just as every American is bound by the law. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=548.12s)]
*  Writer E. Jean Carroll, attorney Robbie Kaplan, attorney Sean Crowley. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=554.12s)]
*  You guys have made history a couple of times now. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=558.12s)]
*  And you also have meant a lot and continue to mean a lot. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=561.48s)]
*  You have been lighting the way, I think, for a lot of people in terms of [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=565.72s)]
*  both moral clarity and strategic acumen. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=569.4000000000001s)]
*  And I really, really want to thank each of you for making the time to come talk to us. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=572.36s)]
*  And I want, I wish you all safety and rest. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=576.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plaAkXDAfCg&t=579.8000000000001s)]
