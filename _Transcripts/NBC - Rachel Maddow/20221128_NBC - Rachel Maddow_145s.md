# China Experiencing Rare Outbreak Of Pro-Freedom Protests
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino)
*  This weekend saw protests in cities all across China, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=0.0s)]
*  sparked by opposition to the government's strict COVID lockdowns. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=3.24s)]
*  It's almost impossible to overstate how unusual it is to see any kind of public protest, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=7.2s)]
*  public opposition in China nowadays, let alone large crowds protesting in multiple cities. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is an authoritarian country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=17.6s)]
*  The Chinese government has cracked down incredibly hard. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=19.44s)]
*  They've made it nearly impossible for activists to organize at any scale at all. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=22.48s)]
*  But look, I mean, here the people are chanting and demanding freedom. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  And yes, the spark of it was about COVID lockdowns, but it's everything. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=32.76s)]
*  In Shanghai, protesters there called for the Chinese Communist Party to leave power, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=37.6s)]
*  called for China's president to step down. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  That's a sentiment that is almost literally unspeakable in China. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=46.04s)]
*  In the capital, Beijing, protesters chanted freedom of the press to each other [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=51.28s)]
*  across a river, a call and response, freedom of the press, freedom of the press. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=56.12s)]
*  An unofficial symbol of the demonstrations has become a blank sheet of white paper [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=61.16s)]
*  held in the air by protesters as a symbol of all the things they are not allowed to say. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=65.92s)]
*  You might remember seeing Russians arrested in Russia after Russia invaded Ukraine, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=71.6s)]
*  Russians arrested on the street for nothing other than holding a piece of paper [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=77.52s)]
*  or a piece of poster board with nothing written on it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=81.36s)]
*  Well, now people in China are doing the same thing, showing that they are not allowed to speak. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=84.36s)]
*  Things are very tense and scary in China right now amidst all this bravery from the Chinese people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=90.84s)]
*  Nobody really knows how exactly the government is going to respond. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=96.92s)]
*  There are fears, of course, that a violent crackdown may be coming. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  But those blank pages, of course, are a reminder. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=104.04s)]
*  You can shut down every last pro-democracy newspaper, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=106.16s)]
*  but you can't shut down the human desire for free speech and for a free press. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=109.68s)]
*  It's also a good reminder that people, wherever they can, will fight like hell to get those things. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  And hopefully they'll fight like hell to defend them and keep them once they've got them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=120.12s)]
*  you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiUmzw3nino&t=144.12s)]
