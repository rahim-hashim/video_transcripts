Video Description: Rachel Maddow shares new reporting from the Washington Post that, like the fake elector scheme that appeared at first to be separate matters until a central role by the Trump campaign was exposed, the scheme to seize and corrupt voting machines in several states now appears to have had central coordination from the Trump camp.

# Trump Team's Hand Seen In Multi-State Scheme To Corrupt Election Equipment: WaPo
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE)
*  Now, in that Georgia case, the other people who've received target letters, the other [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=0.0s)]
*  people who've been told to expect that they may be indicted in that criminal case, they're [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  all people besides Rudy Giuliani, who are implicated in the fake electors plot, this [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=10.16s)]
*  plot to send in forged documents naming fake electors for Trump in states that didn't have [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Trump electors because Biden won those states. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=21.52s)]
*  That fake electors thing is a criminal matter in Georgia. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=24.44s)]
*  It's also a matter under federal criminal investigation as well. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=28.36s)]
*  There's one thing I think worth pointing out about that that I think has been lost by so [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=33.28s)]
*  many of these gonzo headlines in today's news. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Remember how we learned about the fake electors scheme, how we learned about how it came together [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=41.44s)]
*  and how we learned about it being under federal investigation. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=45.46s)]
*  You might remember about the fake electors that it sort of started as something that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=49.0s)]
*  looked like a bunch of disparate efforts in disparate states. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=54.16s)]
*  Some people pretending to be electors who weren't really electors in Georgia. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=58.48s)]
*  Another group trying to do the same thing in Michigan. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=63.16s)]
*  Another group trying to do it but sort of differently in the state of Arizona. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=65.56s)]
*  It looked different in a whole bunch of different states when that happened and when that first [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=70.1s)]
*  came to public attention. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=74.0s)]
*  That matter, the fake electors thing appears to have become a federal criminal investigation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=76.56s)]
*  rather than just an investigation in individual states. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=81.28s)]
*  When it became apparent that this thing wasn't just spontaneously happening in multiple states, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=84.36s)]
*  it was an organized thing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=89.84s)]
*  The Trump campaign and other people around President Trump organized that effort around [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=91.72s)]
*  the country. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=96.12s)]
*  These weren't just disparate things that were happening in different states at the same [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=97.12s)]
*  time sort of by happenstance, by coincidence, it was an organized central top-down effort. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=100.72s)]
*  That is the pattern that we saw happen with the fake electors thing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=108.5s)]
*  Today, that same pattern started to become apparent in another thing they did to try [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=111.86s)]
*  to overturn the election results. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=116.54s)]
*  Specifically the effort to grab voting machines, to seize supposedly secure voting equipment [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=118.26s)]
*  and tabulators in multiple states even though that equipment is very highly regulated and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  is only supposed to have, people are only supposed to have access to it under very tightly [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=130.54s)]
*  controlled circumstances. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=136.0s)]
*  Now there have been criminal charges brought already in the state of Colorado for Trump [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=138.22s)]
*  folks seizing and corrupting voting equipment there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=141.82s)]
*  The same thing is under criminal investigation in multiple jurisdictions in Michigan as well. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=145.38s)]
*  But now today the Washington Post reports that in Colorado, in Michigan, in Nevada, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=151.26s)]
*  in Georgia and a whole bunch of states, these folks messing with the voting equipment apparently [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=156.02s)]
*  weren't just spontaneously acting on their own to illegally access all this equipment [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=161.54s)]
*  that they weren't supposed to be able to touch. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=166.1s)]
*  They didn't just all have the same idea all at once independently, coincidentally. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=168.22s)]
*  The Washington Post reports today in something of a bombshell that just like with the fake [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  electors, this one too appears to have been a centrally coordinated effort run by people [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=177.66s)]
*  close to Trump including at least one Trump campaign lawyer. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=182.82s)]
*  Again, with the fake electors thing, it was evidence of the Trump campaign's involvement, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=187.18s)]
*  their national coordination of what otherwise looked like disparate efforts in a whole bunch [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=194.06s)]
*  of states. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=197.98s)]
*  That's apparently what led to the now ongoing federal criminal investigation of the fake [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=199.18s)]
*  electors scheme. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=203.9s)]
*  As of today, the Washington Post reports that there was a similar central organized effort [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=206.06s)]
*  running these schemes to seize and corrupt secure voting machines in multiple states [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  and that it was linked to the Trump campaign. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  So all of us have been trying to track all these things. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=220.54s)]
*  We're all going to have to like add another column to the billboard sized spreadsheets [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=224.22s)]
*  we're all maintaining now trying to keep track of the various criminal investigations that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=228.22s)]
*  surround the last president. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWsXhb6nhE&t=232.14s)]
