Later, on March 28, 2018, Maddow reported that Donald Trump, having embraced the idea of privatizing veterans' health care, wanted Hegseth to replace David Shulkin as his secretary of Veterans Affairs.

# Flashback: Hegseth leads Republican push to privatize veterans' health care
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k)
*  Part of the deal we make with people who agree to serve this country in the military is that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=0.0s)]
*  if you are a veteran, our country agrees to take care of your health care needs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=5.12s)]
*  When the Continental Congress created the country in the first place, they passed a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=9.56s)]
*  law to help disabled American veterans. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  In 1789, one of the very first things the very first U.S. Congress did was to pass a [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=16.92s)]
*  law to help disabled veterans. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=21.76s)]
*  As a country, we have pledged from before the beginning of the beginning that one of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=24.3s)]
*  the core functions of the government of the United States is to care for veterans. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=28.28s)]
*  It's part of the deal that we make with Americans who serve in the military. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=33.96s)]
*  It is not a controversial idea, and it, until this point, hasn't ever been one. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=37.56s)]
*  It's about how we treat our veterans every single day of the year. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  It's about making sure they have the care they need and the benefits that they've earned [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=47.84s)]
*  when they come home. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  America must and will keep its word to those men and women who have given us so much. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=55.16s)]
*  Veterans have been promised good health care when they are sick and disabled. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  They must be treated with fairness and respect. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  We honor our veterans as well. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=69.92s)]
*  In Abraham Lincoln's words, by caring for him who shall have borne the battle and for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=72.36s)]
*  his widow and orphan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=76.48s)]
*  I've said before that America's debt to those who would fight for her defense doesn't end [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=78.16s)]
*  the day the uniform comes off. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=82.48s)]
*  For the security of our nation, it must not end. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=84.88s)]
*  It is not a controversial idea in American politics. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=88.24s)]
*  It is not a partisan idea at all, or at least mostly. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=90.36s)]
*  For a while now, an idea has percolated on the right to scrap the VA. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  To scrap the VA, turn it over to the private sector, and let veterans try their luck there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=101.84s)]
*  This thing has simmered out there as an idea on the right for a long time, but it has always [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=107.17999999999999s)]
*  been seen as too fringe, too radical to actually get anywhere in real mainstream, realistic [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=111.76s)]
*  politics. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  In his 2008 presidential campaign, for example, John McCain briefly pitched a veterans group [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=118.36s)]
*  on the idea of sending veterans into the private sector to get their care. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  The veterans groups were not receptive. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=126.36s)]
*  That idea went nowhere, and then it was over. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=128.06s)]
*  A couple years later, Republican Colorado U.S. Senate candidate Ken Buck said he wanted [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  to privatize the VA. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=134.74s)]
*  He got slammed by veterans groups, and pretty soon his spokesman was saying definitively, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=136.72s)]
*  quote, Ken is not for privatizing the VA hospitals. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=140.52s)]
*  The next year, Mitt Romney briefly suggested a privatizing voucher system for the VA, and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=145.08s)]
*  veterans groups came out strongly against it, and he quickly said he was just kicking [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=150.68s)]
*  around a hypothetical, didn't mean it at all. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=153.96s)]
*  This year, though, something different is going on. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  At least three of the major candidates, or probable candidates for the Republican presidential [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=160.4s)]
*  Bush, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio have all, in quick succession, suddenly come out in [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=165.44s)]
*  support of privatizing some or all of the VA. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=172.0s)]
*  Why is this happening all of a sudden? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=176.48s)]
*  Why all of a sudden are not just one of these guys here or there, but all of those three [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=178.56s)]
*  guys all deciding now that it is newly politically palatable to suggest something that just a [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=182.36s)]
*  couple of years ago was a real third reel? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=187.68s)]
*  I think two things are going on here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=190.42s)]
*  One of them you definitely already know about. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=194.28s)]
*  One of them is that the VA has not been doing itself any favors lately. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=196.12s)]
*  The VA has been buffeted by scandal after scandal over the last few years, including [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=198.84s)]
*  the major scandal over veterans' wait times for appointments, and the VA fudging the data [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=202.36s)]
*  about those wait times. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=207.8s)]
*  That's a scandal that led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=208.96s)]
*  So people who want to defend the VA from those who would like to abolish it, defenders of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=213.2s)]
*  the VA are in a situation now where it is politically difficult to defend the VA because [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  it's had so much bad press. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=221.88000000000002s)]
*  And then there's the second thing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=224.4s)]
*  Turns out there was something the founding fathers did not foresee when they thought [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=226.44s)]
*  about our nation's sacred need to care for our vets. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=229.08s)]
*  What they maybe did not anticipate were a couple of guys called the Koch brothers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=233.88000000000002s)]
*  Last year in June, a group called Concern Veterans for America convened a summit on [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=239.08s)]
*  privatizing the VA. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=243.88000000000002s)]
*  John McCain was there, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was there, Senator Rubio was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=245.88000000000002s)]
*  there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=249.56s)]
*  The point of this summit by Concern Veterans for America was to celebrate the release of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=250.56s)]
*  that group's big report on fixing the VA. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=254.44s)]
*  And their big proposal, their big proposed fix for the VA was to privatize it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=257.36s)]
*  Concern Veterans for America wants to privatize much of the VA system for health care. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=263.0s)]
*  I should tell you that Concern Veterans for America is not some scrappy grassroots veterans [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=267.24s)]
*  group. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=271.24s)]
*  It is reportedly funded just about entirely by the billionaire libertarian brothers Charles [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=272.24s)]
*  and David Koch and their network of donors. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=277.06s)]
*  The Koch donor network almost literally created this group. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=279.44s)]
*  And that is not my characterization. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=283.78s)]
*  That comes from the group's CEO, who's named Pete Hegseth. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=285.52s)]
*  And this was him speaking at a Koch donor conference last June. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=288.76s)]
*  Concern Veterans for America is an organization that this network literally created. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=291.76s)]
*  Unless you've been living under a rock for the last couple months, you know about the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=294.76s)]
*  crisis that has occurred. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=299.76s)]
*  What you probably don't know is the technical role that Concern Veterans for America plays [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=300.76s)]
*  in exposing and driving this crisis from the very beginning. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=306.76s)]
*  Exposing and driving this crisis from the very beginning. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=313.76s)]
*  Driving it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=316.2s)]
*  That audio was obtained by an online outfit called The Undercurrent. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=317.2s)]
*  It was published by The Nation. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=319.88s)]
*  MSNBC has not independently confirmed it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=321.52s)]
*  We contacted Mr. Hegseth this evening to ask him if that was in fact him. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=324.4s)]
*  He declined to talk to us about it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=328.08s)]
*  He also declined to talk to us about where his group gets its money. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=329.28s)]
*  What we do know though, just from watching the politics as they play out, is that their [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=333.86s)]
*  push to privatize the VA is working right now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=338.02s)]
*  I mean, it used to be a fringe idea that a politician might float but then drop. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=341.98s)]
*  But now all the leading Republican hopefuls for president who have been asked about it [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=347.34s)]
*  have so far all jumped on board. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=351.46s)]
*  Lots of them all at once. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=353.82s)]
*  And part of the reason for the surprise mainstreaming of this formerly fringe idea is that now it [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=354.82s)]
*  is supported by this much larger and much richer campaign. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=360.9s)]
*  We have intentionally broadened the debate to include big government dysfunction generally. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=390.9s)]
*  Concerned Veterans for America and the Koch Brothers Network and the Republican presidential [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=409.26s)]
*  candidates, they are taking an issue that used to be an absolute third rail. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=413.09999999999997s)]
*  But now when they find themselves pushing on this issue, they are pushing on an open [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=418.3s)]
*  door in part because it is a door that they opened themselves. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=421.54s)]
*  The VA is in such bad shape, none of its traditional defenders feels like they can stand up for [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=424.74s)]
*  the status quo. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=430.38s)]
*  Even though, and this is key, the VA healthcare system consistently gets better ratings than [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=432.36s)]
*  the private healthcare system on just about every metric. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=436.5s)]
*  Not just better outcomes, but higher satisfaction rates among their patients. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=439.48s)]
*  Killing the VA, I'm telling you, is a sleeper issue for the 2016 campaign. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=445.14s)]
*  The Republican candidates are lining up in support and the Democrats and supporters of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=449.76s)]
*  the VA at this point do not appear to have any strategy to respond to what is happening [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=454.9s)]
*  on the right. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=459.41999999999996s)]
*  There is a concerted but as yet low profile push from the right right now to kill the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=460.41999999999996s)]
*  VA. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=466.26s)]
*  Are we at risk of losing it? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=468.3s)]
*  There's a man named Pete Hegseth who's a host on the Fox News Channel. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=470.46s)]
*  He's perhaps most well known for the time he accidentally threw an axe at a West Point [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=474.76s)]
*  drummer on live television. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=478.64s)]
*  Thankfully, the drummer was able to walk away with a few just scrapes and cuts, nothing [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=480.28s)]
*  too serious. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=484.52s)]
*  But the TV mishap, whoa, with the axe is not the most controversial thing about Pete Hegseth. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=486.28s)]
*  He used to run a group called Concern Veterans for America. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=491.0s)]
*  They were funded lavishly by the Koch brothers. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=493.88s)]
*  The reason Concern Veterans for America came into existence, their flagship issue, was [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=496.84s)]
*  to privatize the VA, to essentially abolish the VA. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=500.88s)]
*  The VA is the second largest agency in the federal government. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=505.8s)]
*  It provides health care and other important services to 20 million American veterans. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=507.96s)]
*  And because the VA is essentially an NHS style single payer socialized medicine system, it [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=512.6s)]
*  is a conservative fantasy to kill it off. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=518.72s)]
*  And it has been for a long time. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=522.28s)]
*  Killing off the VA is of course a radically unpopular idea, most of all among veterans. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=523.6s)]
*  The Koch brothers picked it as a project and they funded Pete Hegseth and his veterans [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=529.16s)]
*  group specifically to make that radical policy position a mainstream option for Republican [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=533.24s)]
*  politicians. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=538.88s)]
*  A lot of Republican candidates in 2016, including Donald Trump, came out in support of privatizing [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=539.88s)]
*  the VA, thanks in large part to intense lobbying by Pete Hegseth and his very well-funded group. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=544.92s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth soon became a very frequent face on Fox News and then a host on Fox News, which [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=550.8399999999999s)]
*  is maybe why it should not have come as a total surprise when we started seeing multiple [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=556.98s)]
*  reports that President Trump wanted to get rid of the existing VA secretary and replace [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=560.46s)]
*  him with that great looking veteran guy he liked from Fox. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=565.34s)]
*  As of this morning, Pete Hegseth was still reportedly the president's number one pick [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  to take over for now outgoing VA secretary David Shulkin. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=574.6400000000001s)]
*  The president had been telegraphing through the press for weeks that he wanted Shulkin [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=578.0600000000001s)]
*  gone and that he was going to replace him with TV's Pete Hegseth. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=581.74s)]
*  Then this dropped into our inboxes today courtesy of American public media. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=586.94s)]
*  Quote, Pete Hegseth's experience as a combat veteran and commentator on Fox would seem [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=590.6600000000001s)]
*  to appeal politically to the president, but his appointment could extend to disruptive [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=595.6600000000001s)]
*  narratives already playing out in the White House. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=599.7800000000001s)]
*  Marital infidelity and nepotism. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=603.1600000000001s)]
*  Hegseth engaged in two extramarital affairs with coworkers during two marriages and paid [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=606.4200000000001s)]
*  his brother, who had no professional experience, $108,000 to work with him while chief executive [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=610.12s)]
*  of a veterans nonprofit. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=616.62s)]
*  And while running a political action committee in his native Minnesota, Hegseth spent a third [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=618.9s)]
*  of the PAC's money on Christmas parties for families and friends. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=623.38s)]
*  And so maybe that is the reason it took the president so long to officially announce he [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=628.9s)]
*  was replacing his VA secretary, because the guy he really wanted, the guy he found so [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=632.26s)]
*  attractive on the TV machine. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=636.72s)]
*  Well there were about to be some public issues with him that would be a hypocrisy problem [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=639.62s)]
*  for that young man given his public, stern, family values, anti-divorce statements, including [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=643.74s)]
*  while he was running for office. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=650.1s)]
*  Now that he's just had a new baby with the nice lady he works with even before divorcing [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=652.58s)]
*  the second wife. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1wnUPq_R7k&t=656.92s)]
