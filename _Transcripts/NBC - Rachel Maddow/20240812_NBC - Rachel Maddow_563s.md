# Republicans exposed for adopting Trump's gaslighting tactic to avoid harsh political realities
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY)
*  At that same press conference, Trump told another, not just lie, but a strange story [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=0.0s)]
*  about how he never threatened to lock up Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=4.78s)]
*  He never asked for that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=8.92s)]
*  And when his supporters said, lock her up at his rallies, he said he told them they [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=10.28s)]
*  needed to stop that, because it would be so bad for the country to jail Hillary Clinton, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=13.8s)]
*  and he never wanted to do that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=17.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=19.72s)]
*  And that is insane, because it's not only blatantly untrue. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=20.72s)]
*  We were all there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=24.0s)]
*  It's something we all lived through out loud that was the exact opposite of what he's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=25.0s)]
*  It turns out there's a really good new book about this as a tactic, not just as a personal [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=30.2s)]
*  tick or a crutch for Trump personally, but a Republican tactic of the Trump era that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=36.68s)]
*  they kind of flirted with a bit before he took control of the party, but now they do [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=41.56s)]
*  it whole hog all the time. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=44.839999999999996s)]
*  The book is called Ministry of Truth, Democracy, Reality and the Republican's War on the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=47.72s)]
*  Recent Past. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=52.4s)]
*  It is by Steve Benin, who's one of my oldest friends and one of the longest term staffers [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=53.4s)]
*  on the Rachel Maddow show. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=57.62s)]
*  He has influenced my thinking about American politics as much as anybody has in the world. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=58.8s)]
*  Steve's new book is a short book. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=64.28s)]
*  It's just seven chapters, less than 200 pages before you get to the copious footnotes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  But it explains not only that Republicans are doing this. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  It's not you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=75.36s)]
*  You're not just noticing this every once in a while. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=76.36s)]
*  This is a thing they systematically do, and they do it in a way that Democrats don't. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=78.8s)]
*  But he also explains what they're doing it for. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  He says, quote, rewriting events from the recent past requires a different kind of audacity [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=88.24s)]
*  and ambition. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  At issue are events most Americans saw and remember. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=94.16s)]
*  These aren't subjects of debate for historical symposiums or obscure developments that an [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=98.36s)]
*  average person might have a superficial understanding of. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=103.64s)]
*  Rather, at issue are events from the last few years that people lived through and experienced [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  firsthand. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=110.64s)]
*  Republicans have nevertheless taken on the bold challenge of convincing people that their [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=112.28s)]
*  eyes have deceived them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  Their memories are wrong. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=117.48s)]
*  Independent sources of information are not to be trusted. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=118.64s)]
*  And partisan changes to the recent past deserve to be embraced without question. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=121.48s)]
*  It reflects a radical vision that Trump and his allies have imposed on Republican politics. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=126.36s)]
*  This is now, after all, the party of alternative facts and truth isn't truth. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=130.88s)]
*  As Trump's first year in the White House neared an end, Billy Bush, to whom Trump had bragged [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=136.66s)]
*  about assaulting women during the infamous Access Hollywood recording, Bush wrote an [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=141.88s)]
*  opinion piece for The New York Times explaining what he had learned about Trump. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=145.92s)]
*  After noting that he had confronted Trump about inflating the ratings of his reality [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=150.24s)]
*  TV show, The Apprentice, Bush wrote that Trump had told him privately, quote, People will [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=153.96s)]
*  just believe you. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=159.04s)]
*  You just tell them and they believe you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  Years later, the Republican and his party adopted an eerily similar approach to describing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=164.0s)]
*  the details of key events from our collective recent history, based in part on the expectation [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=167.8s)]
*  that Americans, quote, Will just believe them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=173.18s)]
*  Steve says, quote, The stakes couldn't be much higher. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=177.22s)]
*  The foundation of democracy rests in large part on a shared understanding of current [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  events. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=183.66s)]
*  When that understanding is deliberately corrupted by brazen partisans, the consequences can [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=184.66s)]
*  be dire. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=189.62s)]
*  If you're interested in this as a tactic, again, just making stuff up about the very [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=193.22s)]
*  recent past we all lived through. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=198.66s)]
*  Steve writes about how they applied it to everything from the Russia investigation in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=200.7s)]
*  2016 to the 2020 election to January 6th, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=203.73999999999998s)]
*  Oh, it was Antifa. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=206.94s)]
*  Oh, no, it was the FBI who did it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=207.94s)]
*  Oh, no, January 6th didn't happen. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  It was just a normal tourist visit. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=211.94s)]
*  And then what they're settling on now is, yes, it did happen. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=213.78s)]
*  It did happen. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=217.7s)]
*  And they're all patriots for doing it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=218.7s)]
*  What about Antifa? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=219.98s)]
*  Also, I mean, the one you hear every day from the Trump campaign and from Republican surrogates, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=220.98s)]
*  Trump had the greatest economy ever when he was president, even though his economy wasn't [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=227.7s)]
*  as good as either the economy of Obama or Biden, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=231.61999999999998s)]
*  Even his claims that he completed the wall, which he did not do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=235.66s)]
*  Why are they doing all these things? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=241.54s)]
*  What purpose does it serve? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  Steve Benin's book is called Ministry of Truth. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=246.42s)]
*  It's out tomorrow. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=248.5s)]
*  I will also tell you, if you're an audiobook person, I personally think this thesis and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=249.5s)]
*  enough that I've voiced the audiobook. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=255.1s)]
*  So if you'd like to not just read the book, but have me tell you about it, you can also [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=257.74s)]
*  get the book that way. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=262.26s)]
*  But I did that both because I love Steve and also because I think this book is brilliant [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=263.9s)]
*  and much needed and well-timed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=266.82s)]
*  Joining us now is my friend Steve Benin, Rachel Maddow Show producer, editor of the Maddow [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=268.42s)]
*  Blog and author of the excellent new book, Ministry of Truth, Democracy, Reality and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=272.62s)]
*  the Republicans War on the Recent Past, which comes out tomorrow. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=277.38s)]
*  Steve, congratulations on this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=281.18s)]
*  I know that you almost killed yourself writing this thing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=283.42s)]
*  Thank you for doing it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=285.74s)]
*  Yeah, I'm glad you have done it and I'm glad to be here. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=286.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=289.42s)]
*  So you concede from the very first pages of the book that arguments over history are not [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=291.42s)]
*  unusual for politicos of various kinds. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=299.06s)]
*  But you're homing in on something qualitatively different here, which is about rewriting the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=301.18s)]
*  recent past, stuff that we lived through. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  What is the tactical difference between lying brazenly about the recent past, things we [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=308.66s)]
*  all saw, instead of lying about things that maybe we all can't verify from our lived experience, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=314.06s)]
*  you know, ancient history or stuff that happens in faraway places? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=320.06s)]
*  Right, Republicans have targeted both. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=323.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, there's a culture we're going on right now with Republican officials at a variety [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  levels of government trying to change the history of things from generations past. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=329.22s)]
*  The Civil War, the Revolutionary War, founding fathers, that's an important thing in terms [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=334.1s)]
*  of the Republican culture war. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=338.62s)]
*  But there's a qualitative difference when Republicans target the recent past. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=339.98s)]
*  It's more audacious. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=344.18s)]
*  It requires them to try and overpower our memories and bully our memories into submission [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=345.18s)]
*  over things that we all saw, lived and experienced. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  For example, we see them trying to tell us now that the Trump response to the COVID crisis [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=353.62s)]
*  was great. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=358.22s)]
*  It was perfection. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=359.22s)]
*  It couldn't have gone any better. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=360.22s)]
*  We all know better. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=361.4s)]
*  We all saw and experienced in firsthand what the Trump administration's response to COVID [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  was. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=368.58s)]
*  But nevertheless, they believe that our memories can be bullied into submission and their alternative [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=369.58s)]
*  reality and their alternative narratives can replace the ones we all know. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=372.46s)]
*  But why do it then? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=376.9s)]
*  I mean, as you describe, and I think you make a very good case that it requires a certain [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=379.09999999999997s)]
*  level of audacity to do this because they're asking us to literally disbelieve our own [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=383.09999999999997s)]
*  sense memories, the things that we saw and heard and experienced as human beings, not [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=389.34s)]
*  just stuff we read about, but stuff that we observed happen. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=394.05999999999995s)]
*  It takes such audaciousness. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=397.98s)]
*  That tells you something about how radical it is. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=399.48s)]
*  But why is it worth it? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=401.02000000000004s)]
*  Why are they doing it? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=402.32s)]
*  I think there's two things to keep in mind here. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=403.32s)]
*  The first is that by and large, Republicans feel like they don't have a choice. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=405.16s)]
*  In general, when there are controversies that always happen in terms of politics, in general, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=409.1s)]
*  politicians employ a certain crisis management playbook. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=414.94s)]
*  They stick to certain PR strategies. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=418.26s)]
*  They take their lumps and they move on. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=420.34000000000003s)]
*  But when you send an insurrectionist mob to attack your own country's capital or when [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=422.18s)]
*  you fail to respond to a pandemic or when you cooperate to a certain degree with an [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=425.98s)]
*  adversary to take office in 2016, you can't just employ the usual tactics. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=430.66s)]
*  They won't do. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=435.98s)]
*  These are larger kind of crises. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=436.98s)]
*  These are existential crises. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=438.82s)]
*  And in large part, the reality is that Republicans would never win another election if the public [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=440.58000000000004s)]
*  really started to understand and embrace these existing narratives the way they happen in [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=446.02000000000004s)]
*  reality. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=450.22s)]
*  So I think the first thing is that they feel like they have no other choice. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=451.22s)]
*  The second thing to keep in mind, which is equally important, is that Republicans feel [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=453.46s)]
*  as if they can get away with it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=456.53999999999996s)]
*  And in fact, when it comes to their base, they have gotten away with it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=458.06s)]
*  As of right now, this ample polling data shows that for a great majority of Republicans, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=461.5s)]
*  January 6th was not an insurrectionist riot. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=467.14s)]
*  There was no classified documents taken to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=469.9s)]
*  Trump actually won the 2020 election. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=473.82s)]
*  These are not things where a handful of fringe figures believe it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=475.78s)]
*  This is a situation in which a clear overwhelming majority of Republicans believe this. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=479.42s)]
*  And so Republicans do this at the highest levels because they feel like they can. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=485.1s)]
*  They feel like they can get away with it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=491.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=493.18s)]
*  Well, A, it's a really good assemblage of those things. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=494.18s)]
*  And when you put it even just in the terms that you just do, I feel like it all starts [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=498.54s)]
*  to fall in place to me. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=501.70000000000005s)]
*  But I'll just tell our viewers, you know, like if you are flummoxed by the fact that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=502.70000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump both tells his followers that he completed the wall and also that he needs [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=507.42s)]
*  to be reelected so he can complete the wall, Steve explains the psychology of that and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  its political impact. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=518.66s)]
*  And it's both dire, but also it's helpful to have it spelled out so well. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=519.76s)]
*  Steve Benin's new book, Ministry of Truth, Democracy, Reality and the Republicans' War [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=523.54s)]
*  on the Recent Past. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=527.54s)]
*  It comes out tomorrow. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=528.9s)]
*  The audiobook is read by a goofball amateur narrator named Rachel Maddow, but I still [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=530.3s)]
*  think it came out pretty okay. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=534.42s)]
*  Steve, my friend, thank you very much for writing this. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=536.7s)]
*  It is really important. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=539.66s)]
*  I'm really glad you did it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=540.66s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=541.66s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RonnMWSLPY&t=542.66s)]
