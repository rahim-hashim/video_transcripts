# Velshi: Ukraine Shows What An Existential Fight For Democracy Looks Like
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw)
*  This is my last show with you for a while. I leave Ukraine in a couple of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=0.0s)]
*  days and I do so with a heavy heart, largely because of the suffering I've [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  witnessed here and on the part of the refugees I met in Poland and Hungary [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=8.64s)]
*  before I got here, but also because I've come to know a tiny percentage of the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=12.52s)]
*  people of this nation and I'm deeply inspired by them. They are showing the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=16.96s)]
*  world what an existential fight for democracy looks like. This show decided [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=21.68s)]
*  when the war began that it was important to concentrate on the many [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=26.76s)]
*  aspects of this horror and that has meant less coverage of some very [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=29.44s)]
*  important US stories which my MSNBC colleagues have done an incredible job [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=34.08s)]
*  of staying on top of and holding power to account. Those stories like the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=38.92s)]
*  continued attacks on voting rights and abortion rights and gay rights and trans [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=43.44s)]
*  rights and the ongoing brazen attempts to subvert American democracy are not [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  unrelated to the struggle for basic rights in this fledgling democracy of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=53.24s)]
*  Ukraine. There just aren't bombs and tanks and missiles and rockets involved [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  at home, but the fundamental urges are the same. People yearn to be free, to love [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  who they want and live where they want free of threat. The other lesson with [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=67.88s)]
*  which I leave is that in the face of growing atrocities against innocent [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=72.28s)]
*  civilians here, war crimes and what many in this country including its president [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=76.36s)]
*  are calling an attempted genocide, the world needs to do better. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=80.92s)]
*  Democracy and freedom are imperiled worldwide. If it's tough for NATO and the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=85.36s)]
*  UN to prevent one country from actually invading another and subverting its [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=90.32s)]
*  population, imagine the struggle our world order has with those countries in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=95.0s)]
*  which portions of the population are persecuted by their own governments. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=99.72s)]
*  Afghanistan, Syria, China, Myanmar, Israel, India, to name just a few, and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  there are many more. And we, meaning the media, have to do better at covering [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=110.48s)]
*  vulnerable populations all over the world. We've given Ukraine and its four [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=115.12s)]
*  million refugees our full attention as we should, but we owe similar attention [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=120.26s)]
*  to the nearly 27 million other refugees in the world. We're worried for the six [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=125.36s)]
*  and a half million Ukrainians who've not fled the country but have been forced [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=131.24s)]
*  or scared out of their homes to elsewhere in Ukraine. Unbelievably, there [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=134.6s)]
*  are 48 million more such internally displaced people in the world. Solving [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=139.92s)]
*  this is going to be hard, but while we fight for democracy in America, let's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=145.76s)]
*  keep fighting for those who are suffering from it today with their lives, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=149.44s)]
*  all of them. Let's keep them all in our hearts. Let's look. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  Let's resist the urge to look away. Even when it's hard, watching this unfold is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=158.2s)]
*  really hard. I want to thank you for spending the last five weeks with me. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  Thank you to my amazing team here that's traveled with me through three [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=167.44s)]
*  countries to bring you these shows and to Rachel's incredible staff back in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=170.46s)]
*  New York for keeping this show's DNA intact during these turbulent times. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  But mostly thanks to you for allowing us to adapt a bit to give the beginning [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=179.88s)]
*  of this war the attention that it deserves. I'm gonna see you all back [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=184.76s)]
*  home in just a few days. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=188.52s)]
*  Mhm. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7sWSEs-YDw&t=197.64000000000001s)]
