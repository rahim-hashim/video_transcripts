# Hungarian Couple Shares Living Space With Ukrainian Refugees
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw)
*  On a busy street in Budapest, past a steel gate in a building you'd have no reason to notice, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=0.0s)]
*  is a soft landing for families fleeing Ukraine, where in spite of all they've been through, we found smiles. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=7.0s)]
*  We actually had this idea in our mind that we would host them in our home, but it was clear that 11 people can't fit there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=14.0s)]
*  What Budapest couples Jujaana Uy and Peter Fuddish did have was a second flat under renovation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=22.0s)]
*  You can see it's not quite finished, but with a little love, this house is becoming a home for Ukrainians who have lost their own. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=29.0s)]
*  Many friends offered food and preparing hot food, and we got washing power and medicine and everything, but they need. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=37.0s)]
*  One day we got mattresses and pillows. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=49.0s)]
*  19 people have already filtered through. There's no rush to leave. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=53.0s)]
*  Alexandra Zygalenko landed here with her family and a friend, Rozana, who also has a daughter. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=58.0s)]
*  So we stay here, I don't remember, four or five, maybe days. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=64.0s)]
*  Their journey to Budapest first took them through Moldova and Romania before a train brought them here. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=71.0s)]
*  I hope it will be good in the future, but we want to go home. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=77.0s)]
*  But my husband told us to stay here or there, not in Ukraine, because the war will not stop for a few days. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=87.0s)]
*  Like so many we've met, her family is not complete. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=101.0s)]
*  Alexandra only sees her husband now in photos, clinging to her phone with hope they will be reunited. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=105.0s)]
*  Maybe they open the border from all women, children, men. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=111.0s)]
*  And my husband told me if they open, he come to us, if it will be possible. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=118.0s)]
*  With her friend Rozana and their children, they want to make it to Prague. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=127.0s)]
*  For now, this half-finished home is a respite and a reminder. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=131.0s)]
*  I think they are our guests now, and maybe I will be their guest tomorrow. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=135.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's always a threat that the global situation is so fragile and the peace is so fragile. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=143.0s)]
*  So we always think about this, that we can be in their place anytime. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=151.0s)]
*  So far, that Budapest couple has helped 19 of the nearly 270,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled to Hungary as war wages in their country. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=158.0s)]
*  The couple was happy to make their half-finished flat a place where Ukrainian refugees could rest, recover, and figure out their next steps. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=169.0s)]
*  Already, a few of their guests have moved on to join family in Western European countries. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=177.0s)]
*  The hosts say it is the least they can do. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=181.0s)]
*  Already, more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine, and they all need this kind of help and hospitality as they figure out their next steps. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJoCR01FSw&t=183.0s)]
