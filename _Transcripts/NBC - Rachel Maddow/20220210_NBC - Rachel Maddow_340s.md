# Trump's Odd Toilet Flushing Fixation Reconsidered After Reports Of Document Dumping
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw)
*  It was December of 2019. The president was just weeks away from being impeached for the first time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=0.0s)]
*  It was a stressful, chaotic time for the White House. And yet, President Trump's mind was elsewhere. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=6.32s)]
*  We have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=14.72s)]
*  and other elements of bathrooms. People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=20.32s)]
*  They end up using more water. So EPA is looking at that very strongly at my suggestion. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=27.84s)]
*  Now, in this job that I am privileged to have, I have traveled all over this country, literally. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=35.36s)]
*  I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people about the problems that they've got [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  in their everyday lives. And not once has anyone told me that they wish the president of the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  United States would increase the internal velocity of their toilets or the water coming out of their [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=50.24s)]
*  sinks. But for a while, it was something Donald Trump was kind of obsessed with. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=55.76s)]
*  I said sinks, showers, and toilets. It's the shower, it's the sink. I won't talk about the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=62.8s)]
*  fact that people have to flush their toilet 15 times. Dishwashers, sinks, toilets, sinks, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=70.4s)]
*  toilets, and showers. We won't talk about toilets, toilets, toilets, sinks, right, showers, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  and what goes with a sink and a shower? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  Truly the oddest call and response of all time, making the audience scream toilets back at you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=93.92s)]
*  Here's the thing. I don't really care why Donald Trump was obsessed with toilets. To be perfectly [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=101.92s)]
*  honest, I don't really want to know why or where he got involved in discussions about having to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=106.72s)]
*  flush toilets 15 times. Unfortunately, though, the former president's bizarre predilection for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=112.16s)]
*  toilets is in fact in the news today. And as a serious journalist, it is my duty to tell you [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=118.0s)]
*  about it. According to the New York Times reporter, Maggie Haberman, when Donald Trump was president, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=123.44s)]
*  his staff used to periodically find wads of printed paper clogging the White House toilets. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=129.28s)]
*  They believed President Trump was purposely attempting to flush pieces of paper down the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=136.88s)]
*  toilet. The former president immediately poo-pooed these ideas, reporting saying that he never put [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=142.0s)]
*  presidential records in a toilet, which is definitely a thing I cannot believe that I just said on TV. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=148.4s)]
*  But Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Jacobs confirmed the reporting with her own sources, too. She says [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  that Trump staffers would try to fish clumped, torn, and shredded papers out of the White House [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=160.08s)]
*  toilet. Who knows? Maybe that's why the president was so obsessed with the fire power of the network [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=166.96s)]
*  of toilets in this country. What this reporting does make clear, though, is that Donald Trump has [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=173.36s)]
*  certainly deployed a diverse range of tactics for destroying presidential records. We've been [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  following the reporting all week about how Donald Trump reportedly ripped up White House records [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  during his time in office, despite being required by law to preserve all documents that had come [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=188.0s)]
*  across his desk. Staffers had to try and jigsaw them back together, taping them back together. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=193.44s)]
*  Other documents were just destroyed entirely, put into burn bags. Didn't even know what burn [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  bags were. They were put into burn bags for staffers to decide what to keep, what to shred, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=204.16s)]
*  and potentially what to burn. One of the president's former aides, Omarosa Manigault Newman, told me on [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=208.56s)]
*  my show on Sunday that she once even saw Donald Trump chewing up the remains of a document he had [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=215.04s)]
*  shredded in the Oval Office. He literally put the paper in his mouth to destroy it. A germaphobe, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=221.04s)]
*  by the way, didn't put much in his mouth. Just today, the New York Times reported that the January [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=227.44s)]
*  6th investigation in Congress has found gaps in the official White House telephone logs on the day [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=232.56s)]
*  of the Capitol attack. This week, the Washington Post has reported that he also improperly took [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=238.64s)]
*  15 boxes of materials to Mar-a-Lago, which had to be later retrieved by the National Archives. And [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=244.08s)]
*  tonight, the Washington Post is out with a huge scoop about what exactly was in those 15 boxes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=250.24s)]
*  Here's the lead. Quote, some of the White House documents that Donald Trump improperly took to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=259.44s)]
*  his Mar-a-Lago residence were clearly marked as classified, including documents at the top secret [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  level, according to two people familiar with the matter. While it was unclear how many classified [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=271.44s)]
*  documents were among those received by the National Archives and Records Administration, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=276.72s)]
*  some bore markings that the information was extremely sensitive and would be limited to a [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  small group of officials with authority to view such highly classified information, end quote. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=286.32s)]
*  The handling of sensitive classified information is a highly regulated thing. Mishandling that kind [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=292.88s)]
*  of material is against the law, which leads me to the other piece of explosive reporting in the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=299.12s)]
*  Post tonight, that the National Archives has now asked the Justice Department to look into this [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=305.36s)]
*  matter to see if anyone should be potentially prosecuted for stowing top secret documents [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=310.48s)]
*  at the former president's beach resort. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=316.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TfmNHaXmTw&t=329.12s)]
