# Russian Recklessness Raises Alarm On Nuclear Power Plants
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI)
*  You may remember that at the very start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Chernobyl was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=0.0s)]
*  one of the very first places that Putin sent in Russian soldiers to occupy. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=4.4s)]
*  Now, why Putin sent Russian soldiers to occupy Chernobyl, we still don't really understand. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=8.56s)]
*  But we're finally now starting to get a better idea of what the Russians did while they were [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=15.96s)]
*  at that site. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=20.16s)]
*  This is from the Associated Press today. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=21.16s)]
*  Dateline Chernobyl, Ukraine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=22.72s)]
*  Quote, in the earliest hours of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, thousands [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=24.32s)]
*  of tanks and troops rumbled into the forested Chernobyl exclusion zone, churning up highly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=28.959999999999997s)]
*  contaminated soil from the site of the 1986 accident that was the world's worst nuclear [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=34.8s)]
*  disaster. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=40.28s)]
*  In the dirt of one of the world's most radioactive places, Russian soldiers dug trenches. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=41.36s)]
*  Ukrainian officials worry they may have been digging their own graves. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=47.56s)]
*  For more than a month, some Russian soldiers bunked in the earth. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=51.64s)]
*  Within sight of the massive structure built to contain radiation from the damaged Chernobyl [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=56.44s)]
*  nuclear reactor. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=60.72s)]
*  A close inspection of the trenches they dug and that they lived in was impossible today [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=62.68s)]
*  because even walking on that dirt is discouraged because of radioactivity. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=68.52s)]
*  The deputy head of the state agency that manages the Chernobyl exclusion zone told the AP today [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=74.44s)]
*  that he believes hundreds or thousands of soldiers damaged their health, likely with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=78.9s)]
*  little idea of the consequences, despite plant workers warnings to their commanders. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=83.96s)]
*  He told the AP today, quote, most of the soldiers were around 20 years old. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=88.6s)]
*  The full extent of Russia's activities in the Chernobyl exclusion zone is still unknown, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=95.88s)]
*  says the AP today, especially because the troops scattered mines that the Ukrainian [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  military is still searching for. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  Some of those mines have detonated, further disturbing the radioactive ground at the site. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=107.6s)]
*  The Russians also set several forest fires at the Chernobyl exclusion zone. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  Ukrainian authorities cannot monitor radiation levels across the Chernobyl exclusion zone [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  today because Russian soldiers stole the main server for the system, severing the connection [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=122.68s)]
*  on March 2nd, just days after they occupied the site. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=129.08s)]
*  The Russians even took Chernobyl staffers personal radiation monitors. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=132.6s)]
*  So they're operating without those now, too. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=137.56s)]
*  Why did they do that? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=141.64s)]
*  And did they have any idea what they were doing? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=143.48s)]
*  I mean, these Russian soldiers blundered into Chernobyl right at the start of the war. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  They stayed for five weeks, apparently with no idea what they were getting into. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=154.16s)]
*  Only now are we starting to learn how fantastically reckless and presumably ignorant they were [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=159.27999999999997s)]
*  about one of the most radioactive places on earth. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=164.6s)]
*  The International Atomic Energy Agency said today that the head of the IAEA is going to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=168.28s)]
*  lead a mission of nuclear experts to Chernobyl sometime in the next two weeks to try to assess [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=172.68s)]
*  how much damage was done by the Russian occupation there. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=177.72s)]
*  They say they're going to do, quote, nuclear safety, security and radiological assessments [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  of the site. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=185.44s)]
*  And they're also going to try to set up new monitoring systems to replace the ones the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=186.8s)]
*  Russians all looted and stole, presumably without even knowing what they were for. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=191.0s)]
*  But all this is happening, of course, while the war is still underway in Ukraine, while [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=198.28s)]
*  Russia appears hell bent on taking over all of Ukraine, or at least all of it, they can [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  destroy enough to seize. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=206.56s)]
*  And while the Russian soldiers that occupied the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone are out of there [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=209.12s)]
*  now, that's why the AP was able to get in there today, Russian soldiers as of right [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=213.36s)]
*  now, as of tonight, they're still at a nuclear power plant that isn't mothballed and stuck [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  under a dome like Chernobyl. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=223.84s)]
*  They're still at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine that is currently operating. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=226.08s)]
*  They're still, Russian soldiers right now are still occupying the largest currently [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  occup- operating nuclear power plant in Ukraine, which is also the largest nuclear power plant [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=233.68s)]
*  in all of Europe. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  Russian soldiers are there now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=241.28s)]
*  We know what they did while they were in Chernobyl. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=244.08s)]
*  How are they doing with the one that's currently operating right now, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  Just as we're learning the extent to which these guys respect and understand and can [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  be trusted with all things nuclear, there's all this attention as to whether or not Putin [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=253.32s)]
*  wants to use nuclear weapons in the fight in Ukraine. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  What about the nuclear damage his troops are doing on the ground at nuclear power sites? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IfOLtlvZuI&t=261.64s)]
