# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 22
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I)
*  This is Sergey Protosenya. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=0.0s)]
*  Until recently, he lived comfortably in France [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  with an estimated wealth of more than $400 million, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=5.14s)]
*  money he made as a former top manager [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=9.08s)]
*  of the Kremlin-connected Russian gas giant Novotek. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=11.44s)]
*  He's basically the textbook example of an oligarch. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=15.82s)]
*  On Tuesday, he was found dead in a rented villa in Spain. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=19.04s)]
*  According to the Spanish news outlet, Tela Chinco, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=22.72s)]
*  Spanish police found his wife and daughter dead [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  with axe and knife wounds inside the villa, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=28.52s)]
*  Protosenya hanging by a bathrobe in the garden. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=31.98s)]
*  Spanish police believe this is an isolated case [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=35.18s)]
*  of domestic violence and say this is not connected [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=37.56s)]
*  to any criminal gangs or similar cases. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=40.1s)]
*  This is Vadaslav Avayev. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=43.16s)]
*  He was the former vice president [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=45.96s)]
*  of the Russian Gazprom Bank, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=47.54s)]
*  which is the bank connected [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=49.5s)]
*  to Russia's biggest oil company, Gazprom. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=51.1s)]
*  It's Russia's third largest bank. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=53.739999999999995s)]
*  Now before that, he worked in the Russian office [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=56.14s)]
*  of the president and in the state Duma. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  On Monday, he was found dead [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=60.8s)]
*  in his luxury apartment in Moscow, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=63.18s)]
*  along with his pregnant wife and 13-year-old daughter [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=65.34s)]
*  who had cerebral palsy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=68.88s)]
*  Russian state-run press says [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=70.98s)]
*  that all three died from bullet wounds [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=72.58s)]
*  and that 13 guns were discovered at the scene, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=74.56s)]
*  including one that was found in Avayev's hand. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  They also report that the apartment had been locked [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=80.66s)]
*  from the inside, making impossible in their telling [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=82.9s)]
*  that anyone but Avayev could have been involved. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=86.52s)]
*  Now these could absolutely be totally unconnected cases [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=89.56s)]
*  of men killing their families and then themselves. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=93.32s)]
*  What are the odds that two Russian oligarchs [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=96.64s)]
*  with connections to the Kremlin and the oil industry [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  decide to kill themselves within 24 hours of each other? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=101.76s)]
*  And what are the odds that four have since done so [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=105.74000000000001s)]
*  since Putin invaded Ukraine? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=109.38s)]
*  The Ukrainian-born Russian oligarch, Mikhail Watford, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=111.68s)]
*  who made a fortune in Russian oil and gas in the 90s, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=114.94s)]
*  was found dead in his $23 million mansion in England [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=118.10000000000001s)]
*  on February the 28th. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=123.02s)]
*  And on the day after Russia invaded Ukraine, February 25th, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=125.12s)]
*  the financial director at Russia's biggest oil company, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=128.98s)]
*  Gazprom, was found dead in a cottage near St. Petersburg. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=131.96s)]
*  Now again, these could all be unconnected individual cases [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=136.62s)]
*  of murder and suicide. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=140.46s)]
*  Both domestic violence and suicide [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=142.1s)]
*  are unfortunately common things around the world, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=144.36s)]
*  but these cases deserve a little bit of context. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=146.56s)]
*  USA Today put out an incredible report back in 2017 [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=149.68s)]
*  in which they documented 38 cases of prominent Russians [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=153.6s)]
*  who had died suspiciously in the previous three years. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=157.68s)]
*  They included 10 high-profile critics of Putin, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=161.68s)]
*  seven diplomats, six associates of Kremlin power brokers, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  13 military or political leaders involved in the conflict [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=168.36s)]
*  over Eastern Ukraine. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=171.8s)]
*  12 were shot, stabbed, or beaten to death. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=173.68s)]
*  Six were blown up. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=176.34s)]
*  One died of mysterious head injuries. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=177.58s)]
*  One reportedly slipped and hit his head in a public bath. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=179.62s)]
*  One was hanged in a jail cell, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=183.3s)]
*  and one died after drinking coffee, end quote. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=185.18s)]
*  The other 16 were reported as either natural causes [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=188.78s)]
*  or unknown. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=192.18s)]
*  The Committee to Protect Journalists says that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=193.74s)]
*  in the 22 years that Putin has been in power, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=195.46s)]
*  25 Russian journalists have been murdered. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=198.34s)]
*  A whole bunch of them apparently just fell out of windows. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=201.78s)]
*  On April 10th, I interviewed the Russian opposition leader, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=205.02s)]
*  Vladimir Kara-Mursa. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=207.5s)]
*  He's been poisoned twice by the Kremlin. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=209.18s)]
*  On April 11th, the day after we spoke with him from Moscow, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=211.72s)]
*  Kara-Mursa was arrested. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  Today we got the news that he faces up to 15 years in prison [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=217.36s)]
*  for breaking a new law against saying anything other [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=220.68s)]
*  than the government narrative [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=223.94s)]
*  about what's happening in Ukraine, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=225.04s)]
*  potentially 15 years in jail, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=226.74s)]
*  just for telling me and you the truth. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=229.16s)]
*  Which is not too far off from the story [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=232.52s)]
*  of the Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=234.44s)]
*  who was poisoned in 2020 and was just sentenced last month [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=236.92s)]
*  to nine years in prison on completely bogus charges. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=240.68s)]
*  That kind of thing is just what Russia does. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=245.28s)]
*  So, again, domestic violence and suicide [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=248.0s)]
*  are a scourge of their own, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  and all of these recent murder and suicide cases [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=252.2s)]
*  should be investigated individually. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=255.16s)]
*  But given Putin's government's history [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=257.32s)]
*  of making the people who are inconvenient to them disappear, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=260.52s)]
*  it also makes sense to investigate the possibility [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=264.08s)]
*  that the Kremlin could be involved in these deaths. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=267.0s)]
*  Four Russian oligarchs, all with direct ties [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=270.55999999999995s)]
*  to either the Kremlin or the Russian oil and gas industry, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=273.38s)]
*  all met violent ends just since this war began. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=276.67999999999995s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=281.55999999999995s)]
*  This week, Politico interviewed Ruth Ben-Ghiat, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=284.29999999999995s)]
*  professor of history and an expert on authoritarianism [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=286.44s)]
*  at New York University. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=289.12s)]
*  She had this to say about the governor. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=290.48s)]
*  Quote, DeSantis has autocratic tendencies. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=292.76s)]
*  He has absorbed the lessons of what you need to get ahead [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=295.36s)]
*  in the GOP today, and that is to be a forceful bully, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=298.28s)]
*  even to high school students. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=302.6s)]
*  That's one way he's setting up Florida [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=304.36s)]
*  to be the fiefdom of a certain politics, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=306.0s)]
*  a certain ideology that he clearly then wants [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=308.24s)]
*  to take national, end quote. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=311.72s)]
*  Joining me now is Ruth Ben-Ghiat, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=313.92s)]
*  professor of history at New York University [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=315.44s)]
*  and author of Strong Men, Mussolini to the President. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=317.4s)]
*  Ruth, it's good to see you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=320.48s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=321.34s)]
*  This is uniquely relevant because to a lot of Americans, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=322.88s)]
*  Ron DeSantis is the governor of Florida, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=325.48s)]
*  and it doesn't make any difference to them. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=328.2s)]
*  It doesn't matter to them. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=329.74s)]
*  But you make the argument that he is setting himself up. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=330.88s)]
*  He's watched Donald Trump's relative success [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=333.64s)]
*  and is trying to figure out [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=337.52s)]
*  how to possibly even do it better. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=338.8s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=343.04s)]
*  The lesson is when you have somebody like Trump [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=344.76s)]
*  come into the system, he spawns imitators. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=347.67999999999995s)]
*  Ron DeSantis has absorbed his lessons, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  even his hand gestures. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=353.96s)]
*  But what's so disturbing is not just the content [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=355.64s)]
*  of what he's doing in Florida with anti-critical race theory, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=358.79999999999995s)]
*  anti-LBGTQ rights, the whole menu of repressive GOP policies, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=363.52s)]
*  but his style of leadership, his executive overreach. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  He's involving himself in things [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=373.56s)]
*  that governors never did before, not just redistricting, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=375.36s)]
*  but also appointments to the state Supreme Court. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=378.48s)]
*  And as for the measure against Disney, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=381.24s)]
*  I feel like it's something out of Viktor OrbÃ¡n's Hungary [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=383.12s)]
*  because basically he's financially and otherwise punishing [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=386.68s)]
*  and harassing a corporation [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=391.28s)]
*  because it doesn't agree with his ideas. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=392.96s)]
*  Which it's actually contrary [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=395.48s)]
*  to the way Republicans used to see things, right? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=397.56s)]
*  The idea that you would punish a corporation [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=400.4s)]
*  for not agreeing with your ideas [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=402.76s)]
*  is not a traditionally Republican or conservative view. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  No, but the thing with the new breed of Trumpians [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=409.08s)]
*  and DeSantis is the primary one, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=414.0s)]
*  it's about amassing personal power. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=416.48s)]
*  It's about bullying people. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=419.0s)]
*  And he got the state legislator to approve his Disney [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  and other things in record time. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  And you always have to ask who's gonna benefit from this. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=426.84s)]
*  What's the point? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=429.28s)]
*  And certainly not the people of Florida. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=430.36s)]
*  You know, in that area, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  they're gonna have up to a 25% more tax burden. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=434.44s)]
*  And the Reedy Creek district that's now being punished [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=439.2s)]
*  is going to be left with $164 million tax burden [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=444.2s)]
*  and no way to get that revenue. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=448.52s)]
*  So who is benefiting this? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=450.08s)]
*  Just the power of DeSantis. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=451.88s)]
*  Let me ask you about this whole concept [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=454.0s)]
*  of framing restrictions on activity, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=455.52s)]
*  restrictions on speech, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=458.52s)]
*  restrictions on teaching as freedom. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  That's the interesting part. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=462.08s)]
*  Like DeSantis can do everything he's done, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=463.0s)]
*  except he cloaks it all in, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  I'm giving you greater freedom. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=467.56s)]
*  Yeah, this is very disturbing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=470.96s)]
*  It's actually an old right-wing playbook [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  to set yourself up as the liberal democracy is tyranny [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=474.96s)]
*  and you are the advocate of freedom. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=480.03999999999996s)]
*  And you know, if we really look at what he's done [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=482.88s)]
*  is he's clamping down on, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=485.2s)]
*  if you don't agree with his science, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  if you're pro-science, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=490.48s)]
*  you don't agree with his COVID policies, he fires you. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=491.76s)]
*  And then he appoints a new Surgeon General. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=494.48s)]
*  So he's punitive and this is the kind of projection, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=496.64s)]
*  but it's a classic right-wing tactic [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=501.6s)]
*  to make yourself the bastion of freedom. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=504.4s)]
*  I'm also worried because he's setting himself up [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=506.88s)]
*  to have this kind of regional power base. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=509.6s)]
*  I remember at the height of the pandemic, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=512.4s)]
*  he invited policemen and others [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=514.32s)]
*  who didn't wanna submit to tyrannical mask mandates [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=518.4s)]
*  to come and be free in Florida. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=522.04s)]
*  So he's setting himself up [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  as the kind of nemesis of federal government. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=526.76s)]
*  And that's a very subversive and extremist thing [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  to do in my book. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=531.76s)]
*  Ruth, thanks as always for being with us. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=533.36s)]
*  Ruth Ben-Giott is a Professor of History [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=535.16s)]
*  at the New York University. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=536.76s)]
*  We always appreciate your time. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=537.9599999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=540.88s)]
*  He served as the Lead Impeachment Manager [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=543.4s)]
*  at Donald Trump's second impeachment. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=545.24s)]
*  He's a member of the January 6th investigation. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  Congressman Raskin, thank you for being here. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  It is good to see you again. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  I wanna ask you, sir, about these audio tapes [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=553.36s)]
*  that have been released of Kevin McCarthy. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=556.5999999999999s)]
*  They've dominated the news cycle. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  They've got potentially clear political implications, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=560.36s)]
*  but that's not what you do. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=564.52s)]
*  Your investigation is not about the politics of it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=565.9599999999999s)]
*  How do those tapes, those recordings, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=568.68s)]
*  what Kevin McCarthy said after January 6th about, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=570.8s)]
*  and possibly to Donald Trump, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=574.52s)]
*  have an impact on your investigation? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, they're a vivid reminder of what was clear [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=580.12s)]
*  to everybody who was caught up in the violent insurrection [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=583.16s)]
*  and the attempted coup against Congress [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=586.6800000000001s)]
*  and against the constitutional order, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=589.16s)]
*  which is that the president was deeply involved [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=590.96s)]
*  in these events. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=597.28s)]
*  He was at the center of these events, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=598.12s)]
*  and everyone believed at the time [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=600.48s)]
*  that there were constitutional crimes [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=603.16s)]
*  and statutory offenses committed. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=605.4s)]
*  And I think people had the right sense at that moment [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=608.64s)]
*  that nothing like this had ever happened [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=612.1999999999999s)]
*  in American history before, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=614.36s)]
*  and we had never had a president [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=616.24s)]
*  who had actually gone to the lengths [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=618.8s)]
*  of inciting a violent insurrection against the union [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=621.16s)]
*  and attempting to overthrow our constitutional system. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=624.52s)]
*  So, Minority Leader McCarthy's words [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=628.12s)]
*  that were captured on that tape in a discussion [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=631.72s)]
*  with the Republican Conference [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=635.76s)]
*  just reinforce everything we're finding, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=637.4s)]
*  which is that this was an orchestrated, premeditated assault [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=641.1600000000001s)]
*  on our system of government. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=646.12s)]
*  And we have, I think, what will be a very riveting story [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=647.96s)]
*  to tell America about how this came about, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=652.32s)]
*  what were the causes behind it, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=654.84s)]
*  and what we need to do to fortify our institutions [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=656.12s)]
*  in the future against coups and insurrections. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=659.32s)]
*  And that last sentence is really the reason [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=662.5200000000001s)]
*  why anybody should care about this, right? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=664.84s)]
*  Because a lot of people make the argument [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=666.72s)]
*  that this is history, it might be an aberration, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=668.12s)]
*  it's an anomaly, Donald Trump's an anomaly, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=670.96s)]
*  but in fact, what we learned is that [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=672.88s)]
*  the institutions we have, strong though they are, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=674.8000000000001s)]
*  we're not strong enough to prevent an attempted coup. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=677.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is a democracy, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=683.36s)]
*  and in a democracy, the people have the right to the truth [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=684.84s)]
*  about their own governing institutions. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=687.88s)]
*  And we came very close to losing it all on that day. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=690.4s)]
*  Had Mike Pence succumbed to the extraordinary pressure [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=694.32s)]
*  and coercion campaign being brought down upon him [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=699.16s)]
*  by Donald Trump and his lieutenants, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=702.8s)]
*  what would have happened is Pence would have returned [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  to sender dozens of Electoral College votes, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=709.24s)]
*  lowering Joe Biden's vote total from 306 to below 270 [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=712.44s)]
*  in Electoral College if he had followed Trump's orders [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=717.8000000000001s)]
*  and rejected Arizona and Georgia and Pennsylvania's electors. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  At that point, it would have shifted the whole election [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=725.4000000000001s)]
*  into the House of Representatives, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=728.2s)]
*  where they understood we would be voting [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  not by one member one vote, but one state one vote. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=731.6400000000001s)]
*  And the GOP controlled 27 states, the Democrats have 22, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=735.24s)]
*  Pennsylvania split down the middle nine to nine. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=739.6400000000001s)]
*  So even had they lost the vote of Wyoming with Liz Cheney [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=742.12s)]
*  as the at-large representative, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=746.44s)]
*  they still would have had 26 votes. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=748.2800000000001s)]
*  They would have declared Donald Trump president [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=750.32s)]
*  for another four years. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=753.0s)]
*  He likely would have followed the advice of Michael Flynn, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=754.96s)]
*  his disgraced former national security advisor [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=757.96s)]
*  who was urging him to invoke the Insurrection Act [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  and declare martial law. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=763.9200000000001s)]
*  And at that point, he would have called in the National Guard [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=765.1600000000001s)]
*  to put down the insurrectionary chaos [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=768.12s)]
*  he had unleashed against us. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=770.48s)]
*  And so it was really only Mike Pence refusing [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=772.6800000000001s)]
*  to play ball with the president he had served [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=775.92s)]
*  in such an obsequious way for four years. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=779.24s)]
*  And the valor and the heroism of the officers [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=781.64s)]
*  who stood between the members of Congress [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=784.7199999999999s)]
*  and the mob and the insurrectionists [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=787.8399999999999s)]
*  that saved us that day. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=790.76s)]
*  And that's as close to fascism [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=792.1999999999999s)]
*  as I ever wanna see America come to. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  And the people of the country need to understand [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=797.16s)]
*  how close we were to losing it all on that day. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=801.04s)]
*  And that picture you just drew would be bad enough [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=803.52s)]
*  on the face of it if this were just Donald Trump [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=807.52s)]
*  and maybe some people around him. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=810.36s)]
*  But I wanna ask you about, this becomes more important [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=812.28s)]
*  based on something you said during a panel event last night. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=815.9200000000001s)]
*  You said that the committee, the January 6th committee [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=818.76s)]
*  is going to present evidence that proves [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  that there was coordination among then president Donald Trump [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=822.76s)]
*  and his inner circle and his supporters [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=826.76s)]
*  who attacked the Capitol on January 6th. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=829.84s)]
*  Now that's a big deal. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=832.0799999999999s)]
*  Tell me a little more about that. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=834.04s)]
*  Well, there were two streams of activity [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=839.12s)]
*  and one was designed to try to overthrow [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=842.56s)]
*  Biden's majority in electoral college. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=845.92s)]
*  And they use different tactics for that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=848.0s)]
*  First they went to court and more than 60 courts, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=851.3199999999999s)]
*  including eight judges who had been nominated [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=855.24s)]
*  at the federal bench by Donald Trump himself, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=858.16s)]
*  rejected every claim of electoral fraud [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=860.92s)]
*  and corruption that the GOP advanced. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=863.72s)]
*  And in a civilized democracy, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=866.2s)]
*  that should have been the end of it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=869.0s)]
*  But they refused to take no from an answer [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=870.84s)]
*  from every federal and state judge [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=874.0s)]
*  that they brought their cases before. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=876.36s)]
*  And at that point, they tried to browbeat [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=878.4s)]
*  and intimidate election officials as they did infamously [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=881.32s)]
*  with Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger in Georgia. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=884.6s)]
*  You'll recall, he's the one that Trump said to, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=887.4s)]
*  just find me 11,781 votes, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=890.0s)]
*  which was not Donald Trump trying to stop election fraud. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=892.96s)]
*  That was Donald Trump trying to commit election fraud [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=896.0s)]
*  and being caught red-handed. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=899.2s)]
*  They tried a bunch of other things, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=901.08s)]
*  but it all came down eventually to January 6th, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=902.4000000000001s)]
*  where they wanted Pence to declare unilateral, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=905.1600000000001s)]
*  extra constitutional, unlawful powers to consider [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=908.32s)]
*  and then nullify and reject electoral college votes, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  something no vice president had ever dreamed [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=916.6800000000001s)]
*  of asserting before in US history [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=919.24s)]
*  and something that all of the lawyers [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=921.44s)]
*  were telling Donald Trump he could not do. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=923.96s)]
*  And you even had the Attorney General William Barr [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=926.92s)]
*  telling Donald Trump that his arguments were BS, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=931.0s)]
*  although he spelled it out. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=934.76s)]
*  So it was very clear they were trying to perpetrate a fraud [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=936.48s)]
*  against the American people with their counterfeit electors, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=941.04s)]
*  their lies about election fraud, which he knew were lies. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=944.72s)]
*  And then their attempt to coerce Mike Pence [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=948.52s)]
*  and to mobilize this second stream of activity, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=952.16s)]
*  which was insurrectionary mob violence, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=955.88s)]
*  which left more than 150 of our officers [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=960.12s)]
*  with broken jaws and necks and vertebrae and ribs [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=963.12s)]
*  and arms and legs and traumatic brain injuries, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=967.08s)]
*  concussions, post-traumatic stress syndrome. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=970.52s)]
*  They stormed our doors, they shattered our windows, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=972.84s)]
*  they shut down the counting of electoral college votes [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=976.8s)]
*  for the first time in American history. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=979.6s)]
*  And so they interrupted the peaceful transfer of power [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=982.36s)]
*  and they left the Capitol a bloody mess. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=985.4s)]
*  Those two streams of activity came together. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=988.48s)]
*  Donald Trump was being begged and beseeched [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=991.3199999999999s)]
*  by members of his own family, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=996.2s)]
*  by members of his own administration, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=998.08s)]
*  by members of Congress from both parties to call it off. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1000.12s)]
*  And he refused to do that for more than three hours. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1003.2s)]
*  He was absolutely AWOL because he, I believe, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  and this part is uncertain and we got to figure it out, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1010.0400000000001s)]
*  but I believe he was trying to turn up the temperature [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1012.6s)]
*  on Mike Pence by continuing to unleash [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1016.36s)]
*  and then incite this mob against him. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1019.72s)]
*  I mean, even when Donald Trump understood [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1022.5200000000001s)]
*  that Vice President Pence was in danger, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1024.88s)]
*  even when there were mobs chanting, hang Mike Pence, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  he continued to send out messages [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1030.68s)]
*  inflaming the mob against Mike Pence. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1033.3200000000002s)]
*  So it seems clear to me that he wanted to continue [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1036.1200000000001s)]
*  all the way to complete what they were calling [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1039.48s)]
*  the Green Bay sweep, which is what I'm calling a coup [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1042.72s)]
*  because that's what the political scientists call it, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1045.76s)]
*  a self-coup when a president decides to attack [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1048.2s)]
*  the constitutional system in order to prolong his stay [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1051.68s)]
*  in office and set aside the electoral process. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1055.3200000000002s)]
*  Wow, Congressman, you said that the testimony [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1059.12s)]
*  is gonna blow the roof off the house. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1062.56s)]
*  We're looking forward to hearing more of this. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1064.08s)]
*  Thank you for joining us as always tonight. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1066.0s)]
*  Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin is a member [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1067.6s)]
*  of the January 6th investigation. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1069.8799999999999s)]
*  As always sir, we thank you for your time. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1071.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgVS0IiG-I&t=1073.36s)]
