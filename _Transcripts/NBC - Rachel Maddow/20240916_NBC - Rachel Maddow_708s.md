Video Description: Rachel Maddow outlines the sheer volume of objectively bad news for Donald Trump's campaign since even before he lost the presidential debate to Kamala Harris, and points out the "made-to-order outrage" tactic Trump and his supporters have used to distract from that bad news, even if it means exposing themselves as racist liars and offending the entire Haitian-American community.

# Maddow: 'We were supposed to get better at not having our chains yanked' by Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w)
*  It was one month ago, almost exactly, when Trump disparaged Americans who have received [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=0.0s)]
*  the nation's highest military honor, the Medal of Honor, saying most recipients of that award [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=7.88s)]
*  were killed or injured in the process of earning that award. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=14.18s)]
*  And so other medals, like the one he gave to his biggest campaign donor, those are better [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=17.06s)]
*  medals and those are better awards. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=22.28s)]
*  Just an astonishing thing for anybody in American public life to say, even anybody in private [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=25.44s)]
*  life to say, let alone somebody who is a former president and wants to be president again. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=31.28s)]
*  Just an astonishing, an astonishingly offensive and ignorant remark against Americans who [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=38.8s)]
*  are literally the most decorated military heroes in our nation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=46.32s)]
*  Only ten days later, his campaign staff physically shoved an employee at Arlington National Cemetery [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=52.22s)]
*  when she tried to stop Trump and his team from filming political campaign videos at Arlington, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=58.7s)]
*  which you are not allowed to do for all the obvious reasons, not just because it's the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=64.9s)]
*  rules but because it's obviously the only decent thing to do. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=69.06s)]
*  In short order, after those two things, one of the headline primetime speakers from Trump's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=76.53999999999999s)]
*  nominating convention did a two hour gushing interview with a prominent Holocaust denier. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=81.62s)]
*  And Trump's running mate nevertheless decided to go ahead with his own appearances with [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=88.26s)]
*  that RNC speaker. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=92.7s)]
*  I mean, that, each of those things is sort of astonishing for any presidential candidate, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=94.5s)]
*  for any political campaigner of any kind. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=101.86000000000001s)]
*  Honestly, for anybody in American public life, any one of those things would be such an astonishing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=105.26s)]
*  scandal to drag with you into whatever else you wanted to do next in your life. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=111.54s)]
*  But those three things in quick succession are what Trump brought with him into the first [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=116.58000000000001s)]
*  and potentially his only debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=121.9s)]
*  And that debate was a disaster for him. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=126.22s)]
*  It was a debacle. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=127.94s)]
*  ABC Ipsos polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris winning that debate against Trump by [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=129.5s)]
*  an astonishing 22 point margin. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=134.86s)]
*  On the crucial issue of the economy alone, just on the economy, post debate polling shows [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=139.58s)]
*  Kamala Harris pulling ahead of and away from Trump in terms of who the country trusts the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  most on the economy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=150.5s)]
*  That's just one of the metrics that has gone completely south for Trump following that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  disastrous debate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=157.18s)]
*  National polling of the presidential race also started consistently showing Vice President [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=159.78s)]
*  Harris beating former President Trump. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=164.54000000000002s)]
*  And since that terrible debate performance, his campaign and his campaign appearances [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=169.36s)]
*  have been just shambolic. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  He said after the debate that ABC, the host of the debate, should have its broadcast license [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=179.24s)]
*  revoked. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  He regularly threatens this now against any media outlet that airs anything that he does [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=186.24s)]
*  not like. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=190.84s)]
*  He said that after the debate, his opponent must have had magic earrings on at the debate. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=193.44000000000003s)]
*  That somehow fed her the right answers in that debate. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=199.12s)]
*  He told a campaign rally that California, the state of California, has a giant faucet. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=203.4s)]
*  That was his phrase, a faucet with a handle that he said is the size of a building. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=210.44s)]
*  It's such a big faucet with such a big handle that it takes a whole day to turn the faucet [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  on or off. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=221.32s)]
*  And he said that faucet, which he has invented, that is how California dumps all of Canada's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=222.76s)]
*  water into the sea. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=229.56s)]
*  And when he's president, that faucet won't turn the water into the sea anymore. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=238.0s)]
*  He invited a musical artist named Nicky Jam to join him on stage at another rally. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=240.48s)]
*  He said, you know, Nicky, she's hot. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=246.84s)]
*  Nicky Jam then joined former President Trump on stage and surprised him very much by being [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=250.72s)]
*  a man. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=256.91999999999996s)]
*  Trump brought out and brought it brought an outspoken bigot and 9-11 conspiracy theorist [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=259.8s)]
*  to the 9-11 commemoration in lower Manhattan. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=267.4s)]
*  She made a series of viciously, almost astonishingly racist statements about how terrible it would [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  be to have Kamala Harris in the White House, where she already is, because Harris is of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=278.12s)]
*  Indian descent on her mother's side. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=283.0s)]
*  Trump's running mate, JD Vance, was asked to comment, particularly because his wife [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=285.88s)]
*  is also of Indian descent. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=289.72s)]
*  He smiled and swallowed it and said, quote, I don't think that's insulting. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=292.24s)]
*  For what it's worth, these comments were wildly and profoundly and baldly insulting to anyone [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  of Indian descent. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=305.0s)]
*  And whether or not JD Vance cares about that, there are very large Indian American constituencies [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=306.52s)]
*  in important swing states like, say, Georgia and North Carolina. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=311.04s)]
*  They are likely to care. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=314.72s)]
*  And PR also just revealed days ago that Trump's New Jersey Golf Club twice this summer hosted [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=317.76s)]
*  this man, the one with the Hitler haircut and Hitler mustache. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=323.7s)]
*  He was convicted five times over for his behavior during the January 6th attack on the U.S. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=329.56s)]
*  Capitol. His trial invoked previous statements of his like, quote, Hitler should have finished [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=334.47999999999996s)]
*  the job and, quote, babies born with any deformities or disabilities should be shot in the forehead. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=340.0s)]
*  This man posted a lengthy video online in 2020 about what he called the, quote, Jewish invasion [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=348.23999999999995s)]
*  of New Jersey. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  He compared Jewish people to a, quote, plague of locusts. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  And then Trump hosted him twice at his New Jersey Golf Club at Bedminster this summer. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=361.52s)]
*  The second appearance of the history Hitler mustache guy at Trump's club was followed [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=368.0s)]
*  the very next day by Trump hosting at that same club an anti anti-Semitism event. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=372.32s)]
*  The day after the Hitler mustache guy, the day after the Jewish invasion of New Jersey guy. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=380.2s)]
*  This comes in conveniently just as blatantly anti-Semitic TV ads targeting Kamala Harris's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=388.0s)]
*  husband for being Jewish have started running in Michigan thanks to a Republican linked [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=394.88s)]
*  political action committee. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=400.64s)]
*  Now getting national attention there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=403.16s)]
*  As I said, this is a wild political season and I don't mean wild in a good way. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=408.24s)]
*  But Trump has over the last few days effectively stopped coverage of almost all of those things [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=415.84s)]
*  that I just described. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=421.5s)]
*  And he has done so by making such fantastically outrageous and racist and dangerous false [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=422.9s)]
*  claims about Haitian immigrants that just about everybody understandably feels compelled [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=429.46s)]
*  to stop what they're doing and prioritize coverage and condemnation of this truly awful [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=435.08s)]
*  consequential bad thing instead of whatever else they might have wanted to report or discuss [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=440.14s)]
*  about how the campaign is going and what the American people ought to understand about [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=444.44s)]
*  the stakes in this election. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=449.0s)]
*  And that of course serves Trump very well. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=451.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=453.56s)]
*  Anybody who thinks the Springfield Ohio lies about Haitian migrants is going poorly for [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=454.56s)]
*  Trump should consider the context in which he has not just brought this up but he and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=460.12s)]
*  his running mate have repeatedly insisted that this is what we ought to be talking about. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=465.56s)]
*  This isn't bad for them. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=471.42s)]
*  Not as they see it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=472.48s)]
*  If you're taking like a midterm exam or a final exam you have no clue what any of the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=474.16s)]
*  answers are and you're definitely going to fail that test why not get up and pull the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=478.68s)]
*  fire alarm. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=483.16s)]
*  I mean yeah you might get in some kind of trouble for pulling the fire alarm but you [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=484.16s)]
*  failing is no longer going to be the story. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=489.88s)]
*  It's made to order outrage and the press was supposed to learn something about dealing [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=495.48s)]
*  with this in 2016 2015. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=500.44s)]
*  What we were supposed to learn is that that part of dealing with the tactic of made to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  order outrage is that it's his orders. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=511.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=516.12s)]
*  It keeps the discussion on things he's framing rather than on what the election might otherwise [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=517.12s)]
*  be about. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=521.22s)]
*  So yes his made to order moral outrages have to be called out as false and as nonsense [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=522.8s)]
*  because they are dangerous right. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=528.32s)]
*  They not only invite they demand some sort of terrible response from the people who fall [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=530.32s)]
*  for this stuff. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=535.2s)]
*  And so we should trace the origin of this garbage. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=536.5400000000001s)]
*  In this case his lies about Haitian immigrants. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=540.3000000000001s)]
*  In this case these specific lies about these specific immigrants go to a literal Nazi group [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=544.2s)]
*  that has been pushing this particular lie in Springfield Ohio and then parading in Springfield [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=550.34s)]
*  Ohio with swastika flags. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=555.84s)]
*  So we should trace this to its origins. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=558.44s)]
*  That's where the Trump campaign got this. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=560.4200000000001s)]
*  We should also care for and protect the people who are being harmed by this garbage. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nYhdYFSq8w&t=563.5600000000001s)]
