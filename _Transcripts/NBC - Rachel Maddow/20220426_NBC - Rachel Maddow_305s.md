# U.S. Rallies Dozens Of Nations In Support Of Ukraine Against Russian Invasion
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ)
*  Today, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin convened a meeting of dozens, literally dozens [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=0.0s)]
*  of countries from all around the world in support of Ukraine. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=5.96s)]
*  We all start today from a position of moral clarity. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=12.14s)]
*  Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=16.88s)]
*  Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity to defend its democracy, its sovereignty, and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=25.68s)]
*  its citizens. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=32.6s)]
*  But the stakes reach beyond Ukraine and even beyond Europe. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=34.92s)]
*  Russia's invasion is baseless, reckless, and lawless. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=40.36s)]
*  It is an affront to the rules-based international order. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  It is a challenge to free people everywhere. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=50.3s)]
*  As we see this morning, nations of goodwill from around the world stand united in our [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=54.08s)]
*  resolve to support Ukraine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=59.8s)]
*  My trip to Kyiv reinforced my admiration for the way that the Ukrainian armed forces are [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=62.2s)]
*  deploying these capabilities. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=68.88s)]
*  Ukraine clearly believes that it can win. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=72.96s)]
*  And so does everyone here. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=76.12s)]
*  Ukraine clearly believes it can win. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=79.44s)]
*  So does everyone here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=81.72s)]
*  I was Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin speaking today in Germany, and I think the most important [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=84.0s)]
*  thing about what he said there is that when he said, so does everyone here, the everyone [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=88.24s)]
*  that he's talking about is a really big everyone. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=95.04s)]
*  He and Secretary of State Antony Blinken convened this meeting today of countries to support [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=98.68s)]
*  Ukraine militarily. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=104.4s)]
*  And this wasn't just a NATO meeting. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=106.52s)]
*  It wasn't even just a meeting of U.S. and our traditional allies. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=108.2s)]
*  This was dozens of countries. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  It was from Kenya to Japan, Tunisia, Iceland, South Korea, New Zealand. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=113.48s)]
*  And yes, of course now, basically all of Europe and all of NATO and all of our critical allies. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  But this was like 40 countries. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  Plus, some that didn't even put their name on the list. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=131.2s)]
*  Domestic news sources in Israel, for example, report today that the Israeli government attended [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=134.56s)]
*  as well, even though Israel didn't put its name on the list of participants. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=140.48s)]
*  Local reporting suggests there may have been a few more than a few other countries, including [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=145.11999999999998s)]
*  especially Middle Eastern countries that did that same thing as well, because they want [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=149.48s)]
*  to and they will participate in militarily supporting Ukraine, even if they don't want [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=153.6s)]
*  to write their name down about it officially because they don't want to officially have [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  to talk about it yet. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=162.2s)]
*  It's a remarkable thing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=163.56s)]
*  This is a very, very large coalition, a very large, far-flung coalition convened by the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=166.26s)]
*  United States in support of Ukraine. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=171.66s)]
*  The Biden administration has pulled together a remarkable list of countries, and they're [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=174.76s)]
*  going to hold these meetings in a recurring way. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  They're going to do this every month while Ukraine still needs this much international [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  support. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=186.06s)]
*  How did they do that? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=187.76s)]
*  Do you remember in 2017 when Trump shoved that guy at that conference? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=190.26s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=197.26s)]
*  That was a NATO conference. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=198.26s)]
*  I think it was in Belgium. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=200.26s)]
*  And this little country called Montenegro, which is 600,000 people in the whole country, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=202.26s)]
*  Montenegro had spent nine years trying to join NATO. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=207.26s)]
*  Putin didn't want them to join. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=210.26s)]
*  Putin tried to organize a violent coup in Montenegro to stop it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=212.26s)]
*  Trump allegedly plotted the assassination of the country's prime minister to stop it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=216.76s)]
*  But Montenegro went ahead with it anyway. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=220.76s)]
*  They joined NATO. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=222.76s)]
*  This was their first NATO meeting. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=223.76s)]
*  And Trump came up behind their prime minister and just shoved him and then stood right in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=225.76s)]
*  front of him. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=231.76s)]
*  And the guy, like, reacted, tried to, like, laugh it off, make some contact with Trump. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=232.76s)]
*  Trump wouldn't even look at him, just shoved him and walked past him, wouldn't look at [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=236.76s)]
*  him, pretended like he wasn't there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=239.76s)]
*  That was how Trump treated the newest member of NATO right after he was elected in the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=242.76s)]
*  spring of 2017. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=247.76s)]
*  Putin didn't like that guy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=250.76s)]
*  Putin didn't want Montenegro to join NATO. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=251.76s)]
*  Trump just gives him a shove. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=254.76s)]
*  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say not every U.S. president could have done this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=256.76s)]
*  same job today, uniting the world in defense of a country being menaced by Putin. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=260.76s)]
*  I'm not sure we would have seen a convening of the free world like this today under the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=267.76s)]
*  former guy. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=273.76s)]
*  I'm just going to take a wild guess. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=274.76s)]
*  But the Biden administration has done it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=276.76s)]
*  You see the U.S. and Ukraine flags next to each other there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=278.76s)]
*  About 40 countries are raised in support. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=281.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbuaPp4fkYQ&t=297.76s)]
