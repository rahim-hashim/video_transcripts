# Food And Medicine Shortages Add To War's Burden In Kyiv
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44)
*  One month ago today, it was the second day of the war in Ukraine and on that day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=0.0s)]
*  Rachel talked to a restaurant owner in the capital city of Kiev named Alexander Prokorenko [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=5.28s)]
*  Like most of his compatriots. He was new to war [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=11.0s)]
*  He told Rachel that he and some of his neighbors were just learning how to survive [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=13.64s)]
*  They found some pool chairs and pillows and transformed an underground parking garage into a bunker while taking turns guarding the doors with these weapons [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=17.64s)]
*  Now much has changed since then Alexander is no longer sleeping in the underground garage [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=26.740000000000002s)]
*  Most of his neighbors are gone and he doesn't have the guns anymore. He donated them to men on the front lines [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=31.580000000000002s)]
*  Alexander didn't leave Kiev because he couldn't leave his parents behind but that has changed too. They left the city a week ago [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=38.38s)]
*  He stayed he told us today. I'm not allowed to leave the country and I don't want to be anywhere else [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=45.34s)]
*  At peace with his decision to stay in Kiev until the end Alexander decided to be of service [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=51.66s)]
*  He started by driving people to train stations so they could escape [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=56.46s)]
*  He then worked with other restaurant owners to prepare meals for Ukrainian soldiers [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=60.1s)]
*  And then one day suddenly he received a text message from a friend that put him on a new path [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  His friend told Alexander his relatives needed food and medicine [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=70.86s)]
*  so Alexander found the supplies and delivered them and this initiated a chain of help and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=74.86s)]
*  Supported by his friends in the restaurant industry and ten volunteers [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=80.98s)]
*  Alexander now spends most of his day delivering food to those in need about 50 to 75 bags daily containing eggs [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=84.7s)]
*  Butter bread chicken milk, whatever they can find [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=92.5s)]
*  He's also picking up medicine for elderly people [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=95.7s)]
*  During one of the deliveries he met a Ukrainian grandmother who'd been unable to leave Kiev [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=98.78s)]
*  She was so overwhelmed by Alexander's visit that she broke down in tears [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=103.58000000000001s)]
*  She said she never expected to live her last days like this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=109.42s)]
*  As Alexander drives from district to district delivering food he's become a witness to war [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=131.82s)]
*  He took this video that you're watching on his phone earlier this week that pile of debris is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=137.29999999999998s)]
*  The retroville shopping center in Kiev used to be a vibrant place that was filled with restaurants and shops. They had a fancy McDonald's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=142.26s)]
*  It's all gone all of it. It was hit by a Russian missile on Monday [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=149.5s)]
*  According to the key independent at least eight people died in that strike [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=154.38s)]
*  The mall was only five miles from Alexander's apartment. So he's very aware that war is moving closer to his own home [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=158.18s)]
*  He said that the anticipation feels like a game of roulette [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=164.29999999999998s)]
*  Russian roulette and that any day could be his day, but he is ready to fight [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=167.82s)]
*  Joining us again is key resident and restaurant owner Alexander Prokhorenko [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=173.5s)]
*  Alexander we're very grateful for you joining us tonight. So much has changed in this month so much [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=178.78s)]
*  Tell us about what your life is like now compared to a month ago [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=184.7s)]
*  Good evening. Well, it's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=190.06s)]
*  The life has changed to anticipation of war getting closer and closer [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=192.82s)]
*  to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=200.77999999999997s)]
*  To where where you are, I mean it was it was already in our life [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  But now we can hear the bombing more often. We hear the siren every I would say [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=206.06s)]
*  Not every day but in every moment, but every hour [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  So the life has changed totally and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=219.06s)]
*  As I heard before now we're helping out not just [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=223.45999999999998s)]
*  People who need food, but people who need medicine and there are a lot of people [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=227.62s)]
*  With with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=236.22s)]
*  medicine for thyroid [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=237.66s)]
*  That is really in need and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=240.42s)]
*  You cannot find it anywhere in Kiev anywhere in Ukraine [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=243.86s)]
*  So my friends from abroad buy out this medicine and send it to me [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  And volunteers also buying this medicine all around [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=253.38s)]
*  Kiev region and few of my friends even from different parts of Ukraine also buying out this medicine and sending to me and we are giving away for free [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=257.98s)]
*  Because people are really in need of it. So basically life had changed totally from [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=267.34000000000003s)]
*  from normal to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=274.1s)]
*  To a nightmare for seeing these people seeing their eyes seeing what they are really going through [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  It's it's a terrible shock for for for for for us and for I would say for any citizen [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=282.82s)]
*  Tell me about when you say seeing them and seeing their eyes [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=290.06s)]
*  I'm seeing them on the other side when they leave the country when they get off these trains in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=293.17999999999995s)]
*  Whether it was Hungary or or here in Poland and and it's it's women and children [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=297.58s)]
*  Generally without men a fighting age because people like you can't leave. What do the eyes look like on your side? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=302.7s)]
*  I think it's it's a terrible shock for us and for I would say for any citizen of the world [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=309.62s)]
*  Well, I would say pretty much the same [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWQVSYVdQ44&t=320.09999999999997s)]
