# Judge in Trump case has familiarity with criminality surrounding Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY)
*  When he does get arraigned tomorrow, mid-afternoon, his indictment will be unsealed by the judge who is overseeing his case. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=0.0s)]
*  You should know that that judge is also the same judge who's overseeing the Steve Bannon criminal fraud case. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=9.0s)]
*  That is also the same judge who just oversaw the Trump business criminal fraud case, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=17.0s)]
*  Trump Organization criminal fraud case, which ended a few months ago with convictions on all counts. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=22.0s)]
*  The judge having a hand in both of those things is a good reminder that Trump's indictment doesn't exactly come out of the blue here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=29.0s)]
*  His business was just convicted on multiple felony fraud counts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=36.0s)]
*  His accountant is a convicted felon who right now is in prison. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=40.0s)]
*  His campaign chairman is a convicted felon. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=44.0s)]
*  His deputy campaign chairman is a convicted felon. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=46.0s)]
*  His longest-term political adviser is a convicted felon. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=49.0s)]
*  His campaign CEO and top White House adviser is right now under felony indictment before the same judge [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=52.0s)]
*  and for the criminal scheme that we believe Trump himself is about to finally be charged for tomorrow. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=57.0s)]
*  It's not like this came out of the blue. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=62.0s)]
*  And while we're on the subject of this judge, you should know that the judge who's going to be handling this Trump case [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=67.0s)]
*  not only handled the Trump business fraud case and is not only currently handling the Steve Bannon fraud case, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=73.0s)]
*  this judge also has the perfect resume for this case in particular because before he became a judge, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=80.0s)]
*  do you know what his previous job was? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=86.0s)]
*  His previous job before he became a judge was working as an auditor at a real estate development firm. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=89.0s)]
*  It is believed that these charges against Trump are about falsification of business records at Trump's real estate development firm. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=98.0s)]
*  It is a little bit on the nose that falsification of business records at a real estate development firm [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=107.0s)]
*  is a case that's going to be heard before a judge who used to audit business records at a real estate development firm. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=114.0s)]
*  But that's the way this thing is going. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=121.0s)]
*  That's the way this month is going for Donald Trump. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=124.0s)]
*  It's like this case was put together in a lab. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=126.0s)]
*  . [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-ceFsWDBJY&t=144.0s)]
