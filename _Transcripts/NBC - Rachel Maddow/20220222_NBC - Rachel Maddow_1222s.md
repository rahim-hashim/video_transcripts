# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 21
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE)
*  Joining me now is the retired United States Navy Admiral James Stavridis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=0.0s)]
*  He is the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=4.0s)]
*  He's MSNBC's Chief International Security and Diplomacy Analyst. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=7.0s)]
*  Admiral, thank you for being here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=11.0s)]
*  And I know you keep getting asked these questions over and over again. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=13.0s)]
*  But Vladimir Putin is playing three-dimensional chess here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=17.0s)]
*  We were expecting something different, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=21.0s)]
*  and he has declared these two regions to be independent nations for all intents and purposes [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=23.0s)]
*  and is moving forward with moving troops into Ukraine. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=29.0s)]
*  How do you see this? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=32.0s)]
*  I see it as an invasion. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=34.0s)]
*  You know, in addition to being Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=36.0s)]
*  I was, after that, the Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=39.0s)]
*  a leading graduate school of international relations and international law. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=46.0s)]
*  There's a definition for an invasion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=51.0s)]
*  It's the imposition of armed troops for political purpose [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=54.0s)]
*  into a sovereign country without the consent of that nation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=59.0s)]
*  Whether it's a squad of 12, a squadron of tanks, or an army of 190,000 isn't relevant. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=63.0s)]
*  This is an invasion. That's what's occurring. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=71.0s)]
*  We need to deal with it as such, and that means a significant package of response from the West Alley. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=74.0s)]
*  A significant package of response from the West, and that, I assume, means two things. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=81.0s)]
*  I was talking to Ambassador McFaul earlier, sanctions and diplomacy, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=86.0s)]
*  and it means something to do with NATO, right? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=92.0s)]
*  There are all these NATO countries. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=95.0s)]
*  I'll ask my control room to put the map up of what NATO looks like today. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=96.0s)]
*  There are a lot of NATO countries right around Ukraine. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=100.0s)]
*  What are they planning to do? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=103.0s)]
*  I think there are three things that the Alliance needs to do right now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=107.0s)]
*  Number one, you alluded to, is simply stand diplomatically, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=112.0s)]
*  go as an Alliance in front of the United Nations, put the weight of this Alliance, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=116.0s)]
*  30 nations representing 55% of the world's GDP, 3 million men and women under arms, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=121.0s)]
*  almost all volunteers, an incredible, powerful Alliance. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=129.0s)]
*  Put the diplomatic weight of that Alliance behind Ukraine. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=133.0s)]
*  Number two, perhaps more importantly, the sanctions package, and it needs to be overwhelming. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=137.0s)]
*  We need shock and awe economically. That's going to be hard. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=144.0s)]
*  Putin has spent a lot of time trying to kind of fireproof his economy, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=148.0s)]
*  but there are mechanisms to take Russia out of the swift system, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=152.0s)]
*  to go after individual oligarch fortunes, and above all, to go after oil and gas, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=157.0s)]
*  which is the beating heart of the Russian economy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=164.0s)]
*  And number three, Ali, really to the Alliance, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=168.0s)]
*  if Putin is going to fully continue this invasion, expand it, move throughout the country, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=171.0s)]
*  I think the logical response is going to be a resistance. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=178.0s)]
*  And you may see the Zelensky government have to leave Kiev and move to the far west, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=182.0s)]
*  to Lviv in the far west of Ukraine, or even form a government in exile and then run in resistance, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=189.0s)]
*  much like Charles de Gaulle did in France in the 1940s. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=198.0s)]
*  We need to facilitate that, arm it, train it, equip it, make this a very difficult move on the part of Putin. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=202.0s)]
*  So there's diplomacy, there's economics, there's a military response here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=210.0s)]
*  All of that can be, I hope, sufficient to deter Putin from further conquest in Ukraine. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=215.0s)]
*  So let's put that map up of Ukraine again, because I want to ask you something. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=223.0s)]
*  There is this theory that these are independent regions with a lot of Russian speakers who require the protection of the Russians, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=226.0s)]
*  but there's a lot of reporting about the fact that they are looking to take the government out in Kiev. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=234.0s)]
*  You were just talking about the fact that they might move Zelensky out and they may have to form a government in exile. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=239.0s)]
*  How likely do you think that this escalates beyond the eastern parts of Ukraine, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=245.0s)]
*  which have large Russian speaking populations, into the rest of Ukraine? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=250.0s)]
*  I think it is about a one in three chance, Ali, from where we sit tonight, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=254.0s)]
*  that Putin will go full Blitzkrieg, shock and awe, take it to Kiev, one in three. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=261.0s)]
*  I think it's a two in three chance that he will take a somewhat more conservative approach [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=268.0s)]
*  and really focus his forces on this region where there are admittedly many Russian speakers, ethnic Russians. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=273.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has done an airdrop of passports, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=281.0s)]
*  handed out hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to Ukrainians who are sympathetic to Russia in this section. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=285.0s)]
*  So he'll try and build around that, but we need to not be fooled by that, not to be distracted by it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=295.0s)]
*  Ukraine has been invaded here. It requires the absolute full force of the response of the West. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=301.0s)]
*  You have made that point strongly today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=308.0s)]
*  Ambassador McFaul has made the same point, not to fall for some idea that something else has happened here, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=310.0s)]
*  just because it doesn't look like what you think an invasion looks like from the movies or TV. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=315.0s)]
*  Ambassador, thanks for your time tonight, as always. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=320.0s)]
*  In the hallway, there were gunmen. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=322.0s)]
*  This was inside a television station in Ukraine on a Thursday morning in May of 2014. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=325.0s)]
*  This was the last video taken by the journalists who worked there before masked men with guns told them they could no longer freely do their jobs. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=333.0s)]
*  The gunmen presented the journalists with this letter saying that their TV station was under new ownership. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=343.0s)]
*  According to these armed men, the TV station in Ukraine now belonged to pro-Russian separatists, and they didn't just take the TV station. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=350.0s)]
*  All over eastern Ukraine in 2014, those pro-Russian militiamen took over police stations, government buildings, and brick by brick, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=360.0s)]
*  the pro-Russian separatists took control of two entire cities in Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=371.0s)]
*  And they declared themselves independent from the rest of Ukraine. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=379.0s)]
*  That's where Vladimir Putin joined the fight. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=382.0s)]
*  Those two cities, seized by those pro-Russian rebels, they were located in a part of Ukraine where a lot of Russian speakers live. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=386.0s)]
*  And so on Putin's orders, Russia sent both weapons and their own men into eastern Ukraine to try and fend off the Ukrainian soldiers [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=393.0s)]
*  from taking back those two cities to keep them in the hands of those pro-Russian separatists. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=403.0s)]
*  Now, this has been going on for a while. There have been attempts at ceasefires and peace over the years, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=410.0s)]
*  but the fighting over those two cities in Ukraine has never really stopped. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=415.0s)]
*  More than 14,000 people have died in that conflict since it began. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=420.0s)]
*  And ever since then, those pro-Russian separatists have maintained that they are the ones rightfully in charge of the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces in Ukraine. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=427.0s)]
*  Those separatists have kept a military chokehold on a chunk of each of those provinces marked in the map here in pink. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=439.0s)]
*  And it is into that part of the world today, into that active tinderbox, that Vladimir Putin just threw a lit match. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=449.0s)]
*  Today, Vladimir Putin announced that he was recognizing those two parts of Russia controlled by the Russian separatists, Donetsk and Luhansk. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=458.0s)]
*  Putin said that he was officially recognizing those two swaths of Ukraine as independent, independent of Ukraine. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=468.0s)]
*  Again, it should be noted that the separatists do not actually control the entirety of those two regions, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=476.0s)]
*  but Putin has now unilaterally said that it all belongs to them anyway. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=482.0s)]
*  In an hour-long speech, Putin said that Ukraine, a former member of the Soviet Union, was created by Russia. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=488.0s)]
*  He essentially denied the notion that Ukraine has ever been its own legitimate country. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=495.0s)]
*  He accused Ukraine, without any evidence, of carrying out a genocide against Russian people. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=500.0s)]
*  He said that Ukraine poses a threat to not just the Russians living in Ukraine, but to all Russians. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=505.0s)]
*  And he said because of that threat, he had no other choice today but to recognize those two separatist controlled regions as independent, to try and protect Russians. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=511.0s)]
*  Now, immediately after his speech, Putin signed a series of orders and decrees that allowed him to send so-called peacekeeping troops into eastern Ukraine. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=524.0s)]
*  Again, for the sake of protecting the Russian people, not Ukrainians. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=534.0s)]
*  The general consensus after Putin's announcement today is that he was not laying out a game plan for protecting Russia. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=539.0s)]
*  He was laying out a game plan for war. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=545.0s)]
*  It gives him an excuse to put boots on the ground under the auspices of peace before launching an all-out attack. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=548.0s)]
*  Like when you're a kid, you tricked your parents into letting you sleep over at a friend's house to help them out with their math homework, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=555.0s)]
*  when really you guys just wanted to stay up all night and watch movies. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=561.0s)]
*  You tell them what they want to hear to get what you want, and by the time you get it, it's too late for anyone to do anything about it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=564.0s)]
*  It's a bait and switch. It's been used many times throughout history. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=570.0s)]
*  It's a playbook that is well-worn because it has worked. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=573.0s)]
*  Telling the world he would try to protect persecuted Germans in eastern Europe was how Hitler convinced Chamberlain to give him a chunk of Czechoslovakia. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=578.0s)]
*  He invaded Poland under the same pretext in 1939. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=587.0s)]
*  That narrative, of course, started to fall apart when Hitler invaded Denmark and Norway and Belgium and France and all those countries. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=590.0s)]
*  But by then it was too late. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=599.0s)]
*  This is not just the strategy that started World War II. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=602.0s)]
*  It's now happening again in real time, and this is Putin's big lie. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=605.0s)]
*  Fortunately, most people are seeing right through it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=611.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Anne Applebaum, the staff writer at The Atlantic and the author of Twilight of Democracy, the seductive lure of authoritarianism. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=615.0s)]
*  Ms. Applebaum, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=622.0s)]
*  You are an important voice to give us some clarity on what's going on, because Vladimir Putin is trying to convince the world of a narrative that you know not to be true. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=624.0s)]
*  Ukraine has had a sense of itself as a nation, as an ethnic group, as an identity for many centuries. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=635.0s)]
*  Ukraine was a colony. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=642.0s)]
*  Many Ukrainians were serfs. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=644.0s)]
*  They were slaves, in fact. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=646.0s)]
*  Ukraine's national poet was born as a serf and later on bought his freedom when he moved to St. Petersburg. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=648.0s)]
*  It's a nation that has always had a sense of itself being opposed to the nobility, the aristocracy, the empire. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=655.0s)]
*  Its identity was always very closely connected to rebellion, sometimes in an anarchical sense. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=665.0s)]
*  But sometimes often in a positive sense. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=671.0s)]
*  Ukrainians made several attempts to become independent. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=674.0s)]
*  At the time of the Russian Revolution in 1917, there was very briefly a Ukrainian state. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=678.0s)]
*  They then lost a war with the Red Army, with the Bolsheviks. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=683.0s)]
*  But even in the early days of the Soviet Union, the Bolsheviks knew that Ukraine's national identity had to be acknowledged and accounted for. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=687.0s)]
*  And Ukraine had to have its own republic as a federation. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=695.0s)]
*  But Ukraine was always a challenge. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=702.0s)]
*  It was a challenge for the unity of the Bolsheviks, of the Soviet Union. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=704.0s)]
*  They always had a different sense of themselves. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=708.0s)]
*  They were more westward-looking. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=711.0s)]
*  They talked about democracy even back then. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=713.0s)]
*  And from the very beginning, Stalin sought to destroy them. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=716.0s)]
*  They were the Stalin-organized and artificial famine in Ukraine that killed nearly 4 million people. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=720.0s)]
*  Fast forward that story today. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=728.0s)]
*  Ukraine remains a problem for Putin because Ukraine aspires to democracy. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=730.0s)]
*  It aspires to sovereignty. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=735.0s)]
*  It doesn't want to be part of a new Russian empire. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=737.0s)]
*  And that's a challenge to Putin's version of autocracy, kleptocracy, the idea that only he is in charge and only he decides about everything around him. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=740.0s)]
*  We're watching the development of a very old historical argument. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=749.0s)]
*  And Putin's use of this, as I said, historical nonsense, is just designed to cloud the picture. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=754.0s)]
*  In 1938, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met with Adolf Hitler, cut a deal that was thought to avoid what ended up being World War II. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=760.0s)]
*  You wrote something in The Atlantic yesterday in which you said, there are no Chamberlains in this story, but there are no Churchills either, and Ukraine will fight alone. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=771.0s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=781.0s)]
*  So the West is not blinded by what's going on. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=785.0s)]
*  I think the Biden administration has done brilliantly in its constant anticipation of what's going to happen and its revelation of intelligence. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=788.0s)]
*  The Vice President made an excellent speech in Munich where I was a couple of days ago, bringing allies together. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=796.0s)]
*  Other allies have shown solidarity. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=803.0s)]
*  I think once they agreed on what will trigger the sanctions, I think the sanctions will be real. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=805.0s)]
*  There's been real military help for Ukraine, and yet there is a line drawn as well. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=811.0s)]
*  We know that there aren't going to be any Western troops in Ukraine. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=817.0s)]
*  We know there are limits on what will be done for Ukraine. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=820.0s)]
*  Part of that is because Russia has nuclear weapons. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=824.0s)]
*  Part of it is because people fear escalation. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=827.0s)]
*  And at the end of the day, it's going to be the Ukrainians and their bravery and their dedication to this very old idea, the idea of sovereignty, the idea of freedom. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=829.0s)]
*  It will be their dedication to that that determines what happens. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=839.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has made the argument publicly that the West has cornered him. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=844.0s)]
*  I'm going to put up that NATO map again to show what NATO looks like today. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=848.0s)]
*  That the West had some sort of agreement that they would not get that close to Russia and that that's what this is all about, that they need a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=852.0s)]
*  One can see that picture there, that Ukraine is a non-NATO country and it is a bulwark between Eastern Europe and Russia. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=862.0s)]
*  That's not really true. This isn't really about Ukraine and NATO, is it? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=869.0s)]
*  No, it's really not about Ukraine. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=874.0s)]
*  In fact, a few days ago, the German chancellor was in Moscow and he essentially said, look, as long as I'm chancellor, Ukraine will never be a NATO. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=876.0s)]
*  So he essentially made that promise that had no impact. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=883.0s)]
*  That's really not what this is about. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=886.0s)]
*  It's not about Ukraine being a NATO. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=888.0s)]
*  It's about Ukraine being, as I said, a sovereign democracy that doesn't want to be part of the Russian Empire and whose democracy challenges the idea of autocracy. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=890.0s)]
*  I mean, look, if Ukraine can be a successful democracy and maybe someday it will be, that's a challenge to Putin's system. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=899.0s)]
*  His argument is, I'm the only answer for Russia, only a system like mine can run Russia. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=906.0s)]
*  But Ukraine is close to Russia historically and geographically and culturally. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=912.0s)]
*  And if Ukraine can be a democracy, then Russians will look at it and say, well, we could have that as well. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=916.0s)]
*  The use of NATO as a and the retrospective conversation about NATO and remembering things that weren't said at the time and trying to bring this into the conversation is really just a way of manufacturing an excuse. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=922.0s)]
*  Putin has wanted to occupy Ukraine and destroy Ukrainian democracy ever since 2014. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=934.0s)]
*  And that's really what's going on here. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=940.0s)]
*  It's not. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=943.0s)]
*  NATO is a secondary issue. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=944.0s)]
*  And we don't do justice to the amount of research and time you've spent on this, but I appreciate the time that you have given us tonight. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=946.0s)]
*  And I would recommend that our viewers follow your writings and Apple that was a staff writer at the Atlantic. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=951.0s)]
*  Joining us now live from eastern Ukraine is Richard Engel, NBC's chief foreign correspondent. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=957.0s)]
*  He's located in the port city of Mariupol near the Russian border. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=962.0s)]
*  It's adjacent to areas that are controlled by Russian backed separatist forces. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=966.0s)]
*  Richard, the city you're in right now is technically disputed territory. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=970.0s)]
*  It's it's territorially part of Ukraine, but separatists would like it to be part of Russia. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=975.0s)]
*  So how does that all play into this? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=980.0s)]
*  Well, it means that the battle dynamics, should they ever happen in a city like this one, will be very, very complicated because you're going to have a large segment of the population that is either indifferent or in some cases, there will be people who would welcome a Russian intervention. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=983.0s)]
*  So it would mean that the battles here for soldiers would be very, would be very fraught because in some cases they wouldn't have the entire support of the local population. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=999.0s)]
*  And I've spoken to commanders in some of the small frontline villages and they openly told me that they didn't think that 70 or 80 percent of the people were with the Ukrainian army, just in some of these very small villages that are right on the edge of the separatist areas. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1010.0s)]
*  So this this part of the country is divided. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1028.0s)]
*  And I think Vladimir Putin is has been has been playing on that and counting on that. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1031.0s)]
*  Let me ask you, Richard, you covered this in 2014 and the world was sort of paying attention to to Crimea and the takeover in Crimea. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1036.0s)]
*  But in that region that you're in right now, something similar happened as we were describing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1044.0s)]
*  There were Russian backed militias. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1049.0s)]
*  They might have been troops. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1053.0s)]
*  They were not wearing Russian insignia. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1054.0s)]
*  What's different now than in 2014? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1056.0s)]
*  Well, you remember that clip you just showed a couple of minutes ago about the television station being taken over by masked men or by by men in sort of black clothing. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1059.0s)]
*  I was in that television at the time that I was in that clip you just showed. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1069.0s)]
*  I think you just saw the back of my head. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1073.0s)]
*  So I saw this this happen as it as it played out. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1075.0s)]
*  So there was a revolution here 2014. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1078.0s)]
*  Putin, I think, was was shocked by it. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1083.0s)]
*  He was infuriated by it. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1086.0s)]
*  He seized Crimea and then immediately began to try to take eastern Ukraine. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1088.0s)]
*  And there were there was a movement there, a somewhat shadowy movement that was backed by Russia. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1094.0s)]
*  It was unclear who they were, how strong they were. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1099.0s)]
*  But they did appear quickly. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1103.0s)]
*  They seemed to be organized. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1104.0s)]
*  They seemed to have weapons and they quickly took over the city and sealed it off and ran out the Ukrainian forces and tried to have similar uprisings in many other cities. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1106.0s)]
*  And there was not an attempt at the time to just take the pieces of Donetsk and Luhansk that have now been officially recognized, but to take this city and others. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1121.0s)]
*  But some some cities stood up and rejected that that attempt to break away in 2014. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1132.0s)]
*  Now that Putin is is giving recognition to these two separatist pockets, it will will revive or could potentially revive that movement where other regions are either pushed into trying to break away, taken by Putin or or somehow descended to civil unrest. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1138.0s)]
*  So I think with this approach, you asked what's different about this approach. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1159.0s)]
*  This approach is Putin has made it clear in that speech that he sees the Ukrainian government as the threat, that the Ukrainian government since 2014 in his in his view is is wrong. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1163.0s)]
*  It is incorrect. It is against Ukraine's history. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1176.0s)]
*  It is against Russia. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1178.0s)]
*  And he sees it as as as an obstacle that needs to be removed. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1179.0s)]
*  And perhaps by taking this piece, it allows him to get the the wedge in to topple the government, either by allowing him to further invade or just by causing enough internal problems here that Zelensky's government is somehow overthrown in the medium or short term. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1183.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eXdw3nNPcE&t=1209.0s)]
