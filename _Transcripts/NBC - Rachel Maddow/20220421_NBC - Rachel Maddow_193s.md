# McCarthy Wanted Twitter To Suspend Other GOP Members Of Congress: Report
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY)
*  And, Jonathan, let me ask you about another bombastic allegation, or at least bombastic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=0.0s)]
*  reality that you guys portray in this same chapter of the book, which is that Mr. McCarthy [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=6.24s)]
*  also, according to your reporting, called for more members of his caucus, other Republican [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=9.92s)]
*  members of Congress, to have their Twitter accounts cut off, the same way that Trump [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=15.18s)]
*  was cut off from Twitter. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=18.3s)]
*  He's also denying that he said that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=20.0s)]
*  What is your reaction to that denial? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=21.94s)]
*  I can't quite do a Matt-Al style justice here, but I'll try. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=23.92s)]
*  If you take yourself back to this period, January of 2021, remember, President Trump [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=28.26s)]
*  was widely seen after January's exit as potentially inciting a second attack on the Capitol. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=35.82s)]
*  And so Twitter took action and removed him from that platform. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=41.18s)]
*  And so what McCarthy is talking about is he's hearing from his fellow GOP leaders on this [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=47.38s)]
*  call about some of the more bombastic tweets from far-right members of the House caucus [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=54.28s)]
*  who are looking for any rationalization about the attack of January 6th. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=60.52s)]
*  And McCarthy says out loud on this call, can't they take their Twitter accounts away, too? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=65.88s)]
*  Which is striking, given his tough talk today about taking on high-tech companies, big tech [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=73.88s)]
*  companies, in this private conversation that we have on tape. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=79.0s)]
*  He suggested that those big tech companies he wants to crack down on actually should [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=83.62s)]
*  crack down on members of his caucus, the very members who he is now courting assiduously [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=87.66000000000001s)]
*  to try to keep happy so that he has the votes to become speaker next year. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=93.26s)]
*  And it's a striking moment in this conversation because he's almost pulling his hair out. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=97.64s)]
*  You can sort of hear the anguish in his voice as he's talking about, what else do I have [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=103.86000000000001s)]
*  to deal with beyond President Trump and my own members? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=107.84s)]
*  He's deeply frustrated in that period. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=112.18s)]
*  And once again, the McCarthy office denied that fact. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=114.98s)]
*  And it is a fact. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=120.18s)]
*  It's on tape that he said this, sort of pining away, hoping that Twitter could strip some [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=121.5s)]
*  of his own members of their accounts. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=127.38000000000001s)]
*  So just to underscore this, just to be clear, Mr. McCarthy and his office have denied that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=129.86s)]
*  he said he was going to call Trump and tell him to resign. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=135.44s)]
*  You have it on tape. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=137.96s)]
*  We just heard that he in fact said that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=138.96s)]
*  He has also today denied that he called for members of his own caucus, other House Republicans, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=141.62s)]
*  to have their social media access cut off. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=146.66s)]
*  You've also got that on tape. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=148.62s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=151.38s)]
*  And we have a lot more on tape from this period, which is at the highest levels of American [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=152.38s)]
*  politics. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=157.82s)]
*  It is sensitive. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=158.82s)]
*  It's delicate. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=159.82s)]
*  And it's high stakes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=160.82s)]
*  And we have it all on tape. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  And it's going to, I think, tell a very different story about this period than the story that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=164.94s)]
*  many people are trying to tell right now. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9uE2YtSYcY&t=170.44s)]
