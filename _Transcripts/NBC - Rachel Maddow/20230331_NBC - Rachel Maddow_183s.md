# Judge puts last minute temporary hold on Tennessee drag ban
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4)
*  Today is Trans Day of Visibility, a day for honoring the contributions of trans people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=0.0s)]
*  and acknowledging the discrimination they face in our country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=5.24s)]
*  President Biden marked the day today with a proclamation from the White House, and the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=8.56s)]
*  White House posted this from him online, quote, on Transgender Day of Visibility, we want [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=11.84s)]
*  you to know that we see you just as you are, made in the image of God and deserving of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=16.0s)]
*  dignity, respect, and support. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=20.88s)]
*  We'll never stop working to create a world where you won't have to be brave just to be [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=23.12s)]
*  yourself. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=28.04s)]
*  But for trans people in our country this year, so much depends on who controls the state [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=29.04s)]
*  government where you live. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=33.6s)]
*  In Minnesota, Democrats control the state house, the state senate, and the governorship [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=36.08s)]
*  right now, and they're passing legislation now to effectively make Minnesota a refuge [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=39.76s)]
*  for trans people who travel there seeking, among other things, medical care. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=45.099999999999994s)]
*  In Nebraska, Democrats are in the minority there, but those Democrats have been using [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=50.66s)]
*  what power they have even in the minority to filibuster every single bill. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=54.6s)]
*  They're filibustering every single bill in the legislature just to try to stop Republicans [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  from going after trans kids. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=65.04s)]
*  And look, here's news tonight from Tennessee, another state where Republicans control the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  government. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=72.48s)]
*  In Tennessee, Republicans spent the day today waiting for their new ban on drag to take [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=73.48s)]
*  effect at midnight tonight. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=78.08s)]
*  Nice timing, guys. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=80.0s)]
*  Thanks to a Republican passed law, as of midnight tonight it was set to become illegal in Tennessee [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=81.64s)]
*  to have a drag performance anywhere a minor might conceivably be present, which of course [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=86.84s)]
*  is anywhere. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=92.16s)]
*  Repeat offenses could put you in prison for up to six years. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=94.36s)]
*  Well, we can report right now that Tennessee Republicans are going to be waiting longer [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=97.48s)]
*  than midnight for that because tonight, since we have been on the air, a federal judge has [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=101.76s)]
*  put a hold on that new law. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=106.16s)]
*  Judge Thomas Parker is a Trump appointee. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=108.04s)]
*  He wrote this in his ruling, quote, within our country's federal framework, states are [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=110.64s)]
*  laboratories of democracy that can test laws and policies enacted by the people. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=114.72s)]
*  Even still, these experiments are not without constraints. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=120.04s)]
*  The U.S. Constitution, a law that is supreme even to the Tennessee General Assembly's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=123.28s)]
*  acts has placed some issues beyond the reach of the democratic process. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  First among them is freedom of speech. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  If Tennessee wishes to exercise its police power in restricting speech it considers obscene, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=134.12s)]
*  it must do so within the constraints and framework of the U.S. Constitution. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=140.0s)]
*  This court finds that as it stands, the record here suggests that when the legislature passed [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=144.04s)]
*  this statute, it missed the mark. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=148.88s)]
*  Again, the Tennessee ban on drag was supposed to take effect tonight at midnight, but it [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=152.32s)]
*  will now be on hold while this federal legal challenge plays out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z44YbKYB_W4&t=159.24s)]
