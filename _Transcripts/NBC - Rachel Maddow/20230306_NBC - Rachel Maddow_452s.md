# Because she made a fuss, Judy Heumann made everyone's life better
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ)
*  In 1970, a 22-year-old woman named Judy Heumann, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  H-E-U-M-A-N-N, Heumann, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=4.0s)]
*  she applied for a license to teach school in New York City. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=6.8s)]
*  She'd passed the written exam to get a teacher license. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=10.6s)]
*  She passed the oral exam to get a teacher license. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=13.5s)]
*  But the Board of Education nevertheless turned her down, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=16.4s)]
*  specifically because she used a wheelchair. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=20.0s)]
*  Judy Heumann had got polio when she was 18 months old. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=23.5s)]
*  She'd had to spend months in an iron lung. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=27.0s)]
*  She survived polio, but then she also had to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=29.3s)]
*  And because of that, she faced not just challenges, not just difficulties, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=32.8s)]
*  she faced discrimination because of it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=38.3s)]
*  When she was five years old, her mom tried to sign out for kindergarten, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=41.3s)]
*  and the principal turned her down and said Judy was a, quote, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=44.8s)]
*  fire hazard, and she would therefore not be allowed to enroll in school. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=48.3s)]
*  It was basically the same excuse she got from the Board of Education as an adult [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=54.3s)]
*  when she tried to become a teacher. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=58.3s)]
*  But in 1970, when they told her, no, you're otherwise qualified, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=61.3s)]
*  but because you use a wheelchair, you cannot be a teacher, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=65.3s)]
*  Judy Heumann sued the Board of Education in New York, and she won. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=68.3s)]
*  She became the first New York teacher ever who was a wheelchair user. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=73.3s)]
*  And that court fight was the first disability civil rights case ever brought in federal court. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=77.3s)]
*  First disability civil rights case ever brought. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=82.3s)]
*  And she won it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=86.3s)]
*  Judy Heumann knew how to fight, and she knew what it took to win even the most difficult fights. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=88.3s)]
*  And she did it over and over and over again. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=96.3s)]
*  In 1973, Richard Nixon had signed a law that said that any organization [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=99.3s)]
*  that got federal funding couldn't discriminate against disabled people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=104.3s)]
*  And so that meant schools at all levels, that meant hospitals, that meant the government itself. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=108.3s)]
*  You can't discriminate against disabled people. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=114.3s)]
*  You have to make accommodations so people with disabilities can use those facilities, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=116.3s)]
*  can use those agencies, can get into those buildings, and so on. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=121.3s)]
*  Now, that law was signed in 1973, but then when it came to enforcing that law, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=127.3s)]
*  there needed to be regulations signed and regulations put in place. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=132.3s)]
*  And when it came to enforcing that law and having those regulations, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=136.3s)]
*  hospitals and schools complained about having to put in ramps or accessible bathrooms. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=139.3s)]
*  And so disabled activists realized this law was in the books, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=146.3s)]
*  but the regulations implementing the law were not in the books. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=150.3s)]
*  And it was time for the government to actually do what they said they were going to do, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=154.3s)]
*  to actually do what the law required them to do, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=159.3s)]
*  to actually implement this piece of civil rights legislation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=161.3s)]
*  And Judy Heumann, among them, they started demonstrating at federal buildings all across the country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=165.3s)]
*  And they organized demonstrations at the federal agency responsible for these regulations in Washington, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=172.3s)]
*  and they organized them at the regional offices for this federal agency all over the country. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=180.3s)]
*  The protest organized by Judy Heumann was in San Francisco. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=185.3s)]
*  And that actually ended up being the biggest and longest peaceful occupation of a U.S. federal building in U.S. history. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=188.3s)]
*  More than 100 disabled activists stayed there for four weeks straight. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=195.3s)]
*  They didn't have hot water. They didn't have beds. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=200.3s)]
*  Many of them didn't have access to medicine they needed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=203.3s)]
*  Week after week, they stayed, demanding to be heard, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=206.3s)]
*  demanding that these regulations go into a place to implement this civil rights legislation, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=209.3s)]
*  until finally the leaders of the agency agreed to meet with them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=214.3s)]
*  And in that meeting, Judy Heumann raised a signal point from another movement in American history. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=218.3s)]
*  I can tell you that every time you raise issues of separate but equal, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=229.3s)]
*  the outrage of disabled individuals across this country is going to continue. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=236.3s)]
*  It is going to be ignited. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=243.3s)]
*  There will be more takeovers of buildings until finally maybe you begin to understand our position. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=245.3s)]
*  We will no longer allow the government to oppress disabled individuals. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=252.3s)]
*  We want the law enforced. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=259.3s)]
*  We want no more segregation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=262.3s)]
*  We will accept no more discussion of segregation. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=265.3s)]
*  And I would appreciate it if you would stop shaking your head in agreement [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=270.3s)]
*  when I don't think you understand what we are talking about. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=274.3s)]
*  Judy Heumann taught the world what she and her fellow activists were talking about. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=284.3s)]
*  Their willingness to show up and stay there, it worked. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=289.3s)]
*  I said she knew how to win fights. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=293.3s)]
*  She knew how to win big, difficult to win fights. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=295.3s)]
*  That fight in 1977 won this country's first real protections for people with disabilities. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=298.3s)]
*  And it laid the groundwork for civil rights legislation to come. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=306.3s)]
*  In 1990, Judy Heumann was instrumental in getting the Americans with Disabilities Act passed and signed into law. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=310.3s)]
*  The Rehabilitation Act that Nixon had signed back in 73, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=316.3s)]
*  that was about schools and hospitals and the government itself. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=319.3s)]
*  The ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, also extended those same civil rights protections to private entities, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=322.3s)]
*  to anybody who had a sort of public accommodation. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=328.3s)]
*  People with disabilities need to be able to access the things that other citizens can access. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=330.3s)]
*  And reasonable accommodation for their needs so they can do so is a matter of civil rights. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=337.3s)]
*  Judy Heumann then served in government herself, ultimately, in both the Clinton administration and in the Obama administration. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=343.3s)]
*  This is from the head of the American Association of People with Disabilities. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=351.3s)]
*  Quote, Judy Heumann really helped people accept who they were as disabled people and take pride in that identity. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=355.3s)]
*  She helped so many people understand their own power as disabled people. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=360.3s)]
*  More simply, as Judy Heumann put it in her own memoir, some people say that what I did changed the world. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=365.3s)]
*  But really, I simply refused to accept what I was told about who I could be. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=371.3s)]
*  And she says, quote, I was willing to make a fuss about it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=377.3s)]
*  I was willing to make a fuss about it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=381.3s)]
*  Words to live by. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=384.3s)]
*  Because Judy Heumann was willing to make that fuss. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=386.3s)]
*  Life not just here, but in so many countries is better for everyone, even for the people who she beat in all of those fights. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=388.3s)]
*  It is one thing to fight for yourself. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=395.3s)]
*  It is another thing to fight for yourself in a way that leaves your country and the world better off, not only for you and for people like you who come after you, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=397.3s)]
*  but literally for the people who you fought, who you won the argument against and who you prevailed over in the fight for civil rights. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=405.3s)]
*  Judy Heumann is often called the mother of the disability rights movement. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=413.3s)]
*  She died this weekend at the age of 75. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=417.3s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=420.3s)]
*  Judy Heumann, dead at the age of 75. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=423.3s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKiDJqMrrcQ&t=425.3s)]
