# Local paper records county officials in violent, racist discussion
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg)
*  Last month on March 6th, the McCurtain County Commission held one of their normal meetings, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=0.0s)]
*  which are usually boring affairs for all the right reasons. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=6.0s)]
*  But staff from the McCurtain Gazette News went to that meeting to cover it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=10.0s)]
*  And after the meeting, the longtime publisher of the paper, a man named Bruce Willingham, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=15.0s)]
*  he decided he was going to do something out of the ordinary. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=20.0s)]
*  He decided to leave a voice-activated recorder inside the room where the commission meets. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=23.0s)]
*  And the reason he did that is because he suspected that the county commission in McCurtain County [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=29.0s)]
*  was continuing to do county business after the meeting had ended. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=35.0s)]
*  And that would have been in violation of the State's Open Meeting Act. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=41.0s)]
*  This publisher from the local paper essentially thought that the commission was trying to do business [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=44.0s)]
*  affecting the people of the county without looping the public in to what they were doing. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=50.0s)]
*  And that is something that is just not allowed under state law. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=55.0s)]
*  So this publisher, Bruce Willingham, he made sure that what he was doing was on the up and up [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=58.0s)]
*  when he left that recorder. He told the Associated Press, quote, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=63.0s)]
*  I talked on two different occasions to our attorneys to make sure I wasn't doing anything illegal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=66.0s)]
*  But he left the recorder there, its voice activated, and then he went back and collected. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=72.0s)]
*  And when he collected that reporter, he discovered that there was a lot more going on after the close [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=78.0s)]
*  of the county commission meeting, more than just the violation of the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=84.0s)]
*  that he had suspected. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=91.0s)]
*  Here is how the McCurtain Gazette News headlined it on their front page this week. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=94.0s)]
*  There's an audio recording. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=99.0s)]
*  The audio of this conversation was released this weekend by the McCurtain Gazette News, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=101.0s)]
*  and it is horrifying. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=105.0s)]
*  In the audio recording, you can hear the McCurtain County Sheriff talking to another official [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=108.0s)]
*  from the Sheriff's Office as well as the local county commissioner. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=114.0s)]
*  And it appears that the officials are not going to be able to hear the voice of the commissioner [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=117.0s)]
*  This is apparently due to the fact that the paper has published unfavorable stories [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=122.0s)]
*  about the Sheriff's Office in the past. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=127.0s)]
*  And it appears that the public has been very upset about the fact that the Sheriff's Office [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=130.0s)]
*  has been very upset about the fact that the public has been very upset about the fact that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=135.0s)]
*  the Sheriff's Office has been very upset about the fact that the Sheriff's Office has been very upset [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=140.0s)]
*  The paper has published unfavorable stories about the Sheriff's Office in the past. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=147.0s)]
*  But regardless of what caused any sort of bad will here, the conversation that follows is disturbing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=152.0s)]
*  So if you don't want to hear it, now's your chance to hit pause or turn me off. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=159.0s)]
*  But here we go. Here it is. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=165.0s)]
*  They're insignificant in my life. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=168.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=171.0s)]
*  They bring those things. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=172.0s)]
*  It goes around, goes around. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=174.0s)]
*  I told you, Will. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=176.0s)]
*  I know where two big deep holes are if you ever need them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=177.0s)]
*  I've got an excavator. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=180.0s)]
*  These are our pre-dug. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=182.0s)]
*  I know where two big deep holes are if you ever need them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=184.0s)]
*  Well, I've got an excavator. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=189.0s)]
*  Well, these were already pre-dug. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=191.0s)]
*  As if what they were saying was not clear enough. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=194.0s)]
*  They also discussed the ins and outs of what it would take to hire a hitman to do the job. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=196.0s)]
*  But the thing of it is, you know... [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=203.0s)]
*  We actually told the truth. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=205.0s)]
*  I've known two or three hitmen that are very quiet guys. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=207.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=210.0s)]
*  And would cut no f***ing mercy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=211.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=213.0s)]
*  And lose them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=214.0s)]
*  Because it's all mafia ramblings. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=216.0s)]
*  Yeah, but here's the reality. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=218.0s)]
*  If the hair on his wife's head, her spoonhand's head, or any of those people that really were behind all that, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=220.0s)]
*  if the hair on their heads got touched by anybody, who would be the bad guy? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=228.0s)]
*  Who'd be the white horse? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=232.0s)]
*  I've known two or three hitmen. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=234.0s)]
*  They're very quiet guys. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=239.0s)]
*  They would cut no bleeping mercy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=240.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=242.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=243.0s)]
*  But if a hair on his wife's head, the reporter's wife's head, was touched... [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=244.0s)]
*  In another part of the recording, a voice identified as the county commissioner laments the fact that lynchings are no longer common practice. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=250.0s)]
*  That is no longer something you're allowed to do. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=260.0s)]
*  I heard the other day, I said, two to twelve people going to the sheriff. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=263.0s)]
*  I said, f***, let's get 20. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=267.0s)]
*  They don't have a goddamn clue what they're getting into. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=269.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, but... [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=273.0s)]
*  Not just that age. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=275.0s)]
*  But everybody... [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=276.0s)]
*  I want to tell you something. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=277.0s)]
*  If it wasn't back in the day, when Alan Marshall would take a damn blackjack, whooped through his ass, and throw him in the cell, I'd run for f***ing chair. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=278.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=285.0s)]
*  Well, it's not like that no more. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=286.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=287.0s)]
*  Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a damn rope. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=288.0s)]
*  But you can't do that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=291.0s)]
*  You're gonna think about it, yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=292.0s)]
*  They got more rights than we got. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=293.0s)]
*  If it was back in the day, you'd take a damn black guy and whoop their ass and throw them in the cell, now it's not like that anymore. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=295.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=303.0s)]
*  Take them down to Mud Creek and hang them up with a damn rope. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=304.0s)]
*  But you can't do that anymore. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=307.0s)]
*  They've got more rights now than we do. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=308.0s)]
*  They've got more rights now than we got. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=312.0s)]
*  NBC News has not independently verified this audio. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=316.0s)]
*  We reached out to the McCurtain County Sheriff's Office this afternoon by phone. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=319.0s)]
*  They told us they had no comment at this time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=322.0s)]
*  We also reached out to the county commissioner, who apparently has his voice on that tape. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=324.0s)]
*  We have not heard back from him. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=329.0s)]
*  But we will tell you that certainly everybody in the state of Oklahoma appears to be taking this matter rather seriously. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=331.0s)]
*  The publisher of the newspaper says he's turned over these audio recordings to the FBI and to the Oklahoma Attorney General's office. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=337.0s)]
*  He says he's also already had several conversations with federal investigators. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=343.0s)]
*  The governor of the state of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt, has called on the officials who are heard in these recordings to resign. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=348.0s)]
*  Again, the governor is calling on these county officials to resign. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=356.0s)]
*  He's also asking the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation to look into this matter. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=360.0s)]
*  The state representative for the area has also demanded that the sheriff resign and others resign. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=365.0s)]
*  The local mayor has also demanded these resignations. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=370.0s)]
*  And look at this. This morning, more than 100 people gathered outside the McCurtain County Sheriff's Office to protest [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=373.0s)]
*  and to demand that these officials leave their post over these racist and violent comments, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=380.0s)]
*  talking about how they wish they could lynch people like you could back in the day. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=387.0s)]
*  They wish you could whoop people's ass and throw them in the cell. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=390.0s)]
*  Can't do that anymore. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=393.0s)]
*  They got more rights than we got now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOXRoytCkOg&t=396.0s)]
