# Police arrest disgruntled Republican candidate in connection with shootings in New Mexico
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM)
*  We're going to start tonight with some breaking news on a story that we first brought you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=0.0s)]
*  this time last week when it was just emerging. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=4.36s)]
*  This may have been the only place you've heard about it in the national news, but as [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=7.16s)]
*  luck would have it, we brought you this story for the first time a week ago at this time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=10.6s)]
*  It's a story out of New Mexico. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=15.32s)]
*  And just tonight, as we are getting on the air, there is a major development in that [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=17.52s)]
*  story tonight, and it is a shocking one. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=21.32s)]
*  I imagine, given these new developments in the story, this will not be the only place [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=23.92s)]
*  you will be hearing about this over the next several days. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=28.0s)]
*  All right. What we were able to tell you last week was news of a spate of recent shootings [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=30.52s)]
*  in New Mexico that had targeted the homes and offices of at least a half dozen elected [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  officials in New Mexico, all of them members of the Democratic Party. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=43.2s)]
*  Now, no one was injured in these shootings. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=47.92s)]
*  These shootings hit buildings, not people, but they apparently had all been targeted [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=50.6s)]
*  at Democratic politicians during December and January. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=56.08s)]
*  So just over the last few weeks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=61.68s)]
*  And we first learned of the shootings at five homes and offices belonging to some county [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=64.28s)]
*  commissioners and two state senators and New Mexico's newly elected Democratic attorney [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=68.44s)]
*  general. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=73.44s)]
*  Then we learned that there had also been an additional shooting at the House of the incoming [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=74.44s)]
*  speaker of the New Mexico state legislature. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=78.2s)]
*  We've since learned some additional details about these shootings targeting individual [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=82.48s)]
*  Democratic politicians. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=87.28s)]
*  And it's alarming. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=89.12s)]
*  It's not an individual pot shot here and there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=90.12s)]
*  For example, on December 4th, it was eight shots that were fired into the home of one [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=93.0s)]
*  Democratic county commissioner in New Mexico. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=99.88s)]
*  That was December 4th. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=103.08s)]
*  And on December 11th, it was 12 bullets that were fired into the home of a county commissioner. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=104.8s)]
*  Again, it is all in New Mexico. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=113.28s)]
*  They're all Democrats. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=115.88s)]
*  So again, December 4th at one politician's home, he's a county commissioner, eight shots [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=116.88s)]
*  fired into his home. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=121.88s)]
*  A week later, December 11th, 12 bullets fired into the home of another Democratic county [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=123.46s)]
*  commissioner. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=129.04s)]
*  Then on January 3rd, it was a state representative, a Democratic state representative named Linda [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=130.36s)]
*  Lopez in New Mexico. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=135.36s)]
*  On January 3rd, shots rang out at her house. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=137.84s)]
*  Three bullets went through her daughter's bedroom as her 10-year-old daughter was inside [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  that bedroom asleep. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=149.24s)]
*  So that's three of them, December 4th, December 11th, December, January 3rd. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=152.12s)]
*  But all in all, it ended up being six different Democratic officials who appear to have been [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=156.92s)]
*  targeted. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=163.32s)]
*  Initially, two county commissioners, then a state representative, then a state attorney [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=164.32s)]
*  general and then a state senator. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=169.16s)]
*  So six shootings altogether, again, all targeting Democratic Party officials in New Mexico. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=172.44s)]
*  Tonight, Albuquerque police have announced that they have made an arrest in these shootings. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  And I said this is sort of shocking news. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=183.48s)]
*  The reason it is shocking news is because the man they have arrested and charged is [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=185.12s)]
*  a Republican candidate for a state House seat in last year's elections. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=190.6s)]
*  He was the Republican nominee for a state legislative election this past November. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=195.72s)]
*  Albuquerque's House District 14, his name is Solomon Pena, he lost that election by [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=202.52s)]
*  more than 3600 votes to the incumbent Democrat who holds that seat. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=208.06s)]
*  Mr. Pena was an unusual candidate. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  There was a local write up on his candidacy in the Santa Fe, New Mexico in August that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=215.48s)]
*  noted that Solomon Pena, despite being the Republican nominee for the state legislative [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=221.16s)]
*  seat, he was a convicted felon many times over. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=225.92s)]
*  He'd been convicted, in fact, of 19 different felonies, including burglary, larceny, contributing [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=230.04s)]
*  to the delinquency of a minor and receiving stolen property. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  As a result of those multiple felony convictions, he spent almost seven years in prison. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=241.66s)]
*  But then the Republican Party picked him to be their nominee for this state legislature [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  seat in Albuquerque. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=251.06s)]
*  Again, he made it to the general election as the Republican nominee. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=253.06s)]
*  He lost the election to the Democrat incumbent. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=257.2s)]
*  But now police allege, announcing his arrest today, that he hired people to shoot at some [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=259.82s)]
*  of these Democratic officials' homes and offices. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=266.64s)]
*  In a press conference just tonight, Albuquerque officials say that Solomon Pena pulled the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=269.74s)]
*  trigger himself at at least one of the shootings. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=274.86s)]
*  But they also made clear that they have evidence connecting this candidate to four of the six [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=278.1s)]
*  shootings that they've been investigating, while the other two are still under investigation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=284.08s)]
*  Again, this is just a remarkable development in this story. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  The lead in the Albuquerque Journal tonight is this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=294.5s)]
*  The Albuquerque Police Department has arrested Solomon Pena, an unsuccessful Republican candidate [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=297.26s)]
*  for the House District 14 seat, in connection with the shootings at local Democratic politicians' [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=301.82s)]
*  homes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=307.18s)]
*  Chief Harold Medina said Pena, an unsuccessful legislative candidate in the 2022 election, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=308.18s)]
*  is accused of conspiring with and paying four other men to shoot at the homes of two county [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=312.78s)]
*  commissioners and two state legislators. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=319.62s)]
*  Again, that shows that they are connecting him to four of the six shootings that they've [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  been investigating. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=326.22s)]
*  They're saying that they are not connecting him and these men. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=327.22s)]
*  They believe he hired to the other two shootings. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=329.54s)]
*  They have not yet connected him to those other two, but those two other shootings remain [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=332.06s)]
*  under investigation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=335.66s)]
*  Here was Albuquerque's mayor speaking tonight after the arrest was announced. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=336.74s)]
*  This situation today, I think, obviously points out that these shootings were orchestrated. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=340.66s)]
*  They were dangerous attacks not only to these individuals, which is personally the most [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=348.06s)]
*  terrifying for them, but fundamentally also to democracy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=351.86s)]
*  That is why this is so terrible. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=355.84s)]
*  This type of radicalism is a threat to our nation and it has made its way to our doorstep [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  right here in Albuquerque, New Mexico. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=364.67999999999995s)]
*  But I know here we are going to push back and we will not allow this to cross the threshold. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  Fundamentally, at the end of the day, this was about a right-wing radical, an election [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=372.03999999999996s)]
*  denier who was arrested today and someone who did the worst imaginable thing you can [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=377.23999999999995s)]
*  do when you have a political disagreement, which is turn that to violence. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=382.92s)]
*  Again, that's the Albuquerque mayor speaking tonight after the arrest of this Republican [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=386.92s)]
*  state legislative candidate was announced by Albuquerque police. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=392.36s)]
*  Again, police say that they believe he pulled the trigger in at least one of these shootings, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=396.16s)]
*  targeting the homes and offices of Democratic elected officials, and they believe he conspired [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=400.44s)]
*  with and paid for other men to fire into the homes of county commissioners and state legislators. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=405.76s)]
*  Now, you heard the mayor there reference this was about a right-wing radical, an election [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  denier who was arrested today. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=417.08s)]
*  What that references, I believe, are the frequent public statements, online social media statements [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=419.68s)]
*  by this Republican candidate, maintaining that he didn't actually lose this election [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=426.44s)]
*  in which he was the Republican candidate this past November. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  Again, the Republican party nominated him to be their candidate for the state legislative [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  seat out of Albuquerque in November. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=440.52000000000004s)]
*  He lost by a large margin, by more than 3,500 votes. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=442.68s)]
*  Since then, he has maintained that he didn't really lose and the election was rigged against [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=446.52000000000004s)]
*  him. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=451.08000000000004s)]
*  Local coverage of his candidacy has noted that he is a, in the words of the Santa Fe [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  New Mexican, a quote, gushing supporter of former President Donald Trump. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=457.16s)]
*  He appears to have emulated Trump in rejecting the results of the election that he lost. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=460.92s)]
*  But police in Albuquerque tonight say he went much further than that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=466.64s)]
*  Accusing him tonight, formally charging him with having pulled the trigger himself and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=470.24s)]
*  led a conspiracy with four other men to shoot into the homes of other Democratic officials. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=475.12s)]
*  So again, this is just breaking tonight. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  We'll bring you more on this as we learn more. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=484.88s)]
*  We do know the names of these half dozen Democratic elected officials in New Mexico who we believe [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=487.96000000000004s)]
*  were targeted in this string of attacks. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=493.8s)]
*  We've got calls out to some of those elected officials who were reportedly targeted in [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=497.12s)]
*  these attacks. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=500.56s)]
*  As we collect statements from them, as we're able to get in contact with them over the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=501.88s)]
*  course of this hour, we will revisit this story as we learn more. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=510.35999999999996s)]
*  I knew that was a strange story out of Albuquerque when we first started covering it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=511.76s)]
*  I did not expect that it would develop in this way. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=516.76s)]
*  It was actually a swat raid on this guy's apartment today in Albuquerque that resulted [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=519.56s)]
*  in the first public knowledge that he was the man who had been arrested. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=526.76s)]
*  As I said, we'll bring you more as we learn more. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzIkNz_CMM&t=529.96s)]
