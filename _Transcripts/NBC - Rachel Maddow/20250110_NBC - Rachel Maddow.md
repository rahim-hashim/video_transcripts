Video Description: How much will Americans get to know about the people Donald Trump is choosing to run the U.S. government? In the absence of any real vetting the way it's usually done, Rachel Maddow presents a Rachel Maddow Show Public Servant Announcement to hopefully help fill that gap. In this episode, Rachel takes a closer look at Trump's choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi, who has been working closely with Trump, despite not being given a role in his first administration, showing commitment to his causes, including the prosecution of his political opponents. While Bondi is not highly regarded for her abilities, she does benefit from comparison to Trump's first choice for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz.

# Rachel Maddow on Pam Bondi Five things to know about Trump's (second) pick for attorney general
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw)
*  In the absence of any real vetting or background checks for the people who Trump has named [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=0.0s)]
*  to run big important parts of the United States government, we are hoping a Rachel Maddow [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=6.4s)]
*  show public servant announcement can help fill in the gaps on some of these folks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=10.72s)]
*  Today we've got five things to know about Donald Trump's pick to run the Justice Department. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=16.32s)]
*  His choice for Attorney General of the United States, Pam Bondi. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=21.84s)]
*  Thing number one. It all started at a Benihana. A Benihana in Las Vegas. It was a charity dinner. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=27.44s)]
*  A bunch of big wheel Republican donors were there. And one particular Republican donor had the bad [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=36.8s)]
*  luck to be seated at the Benihana next to the head of Trump's super PAC. She and her husband [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=42.0s)]
*  had given the super PAC a bunch of money, so maybe this was supposed to be a reward of some kind. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=49.44s)]
*  It did not turn out that way. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=55.6s)]
*  Quote, over the course of the dinner, Mr. Lewandowski tried to hold her hand, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=57.04s)]
*  and she pushed his hand away. He touched her leg and she moved it away. He grabbed her napkin [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=62.96s)]
*  off her lap and tried to touch her leg again, and she pulled her dress over her leg to move [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=68.24s)]
*  his hand away and cover her skin. Lewandowski allegedly remarked on the size of his genitalia, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=72.64s)]
*  described his sexual performance and showed her the key to his hotel room. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  She said Lewandowski repeatedly spoke about sex while using expletives. Quote, the woman left [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=83.44s)]
*  the room but was soon followed by Lewandowski, who remarked that she had a nice... [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  Lewandowski also, quote, threw his drink at her, and it landed all over her shoe and the bottom [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=96.88s)]
*  of her dress. He also, quote, called her stupid. So the head of Trump's super PAC was actually [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=103.12s)]
*  criminally charged after this incident. He was charged with misdemeanor battery. He paid a fine, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=111.36s)]
*  he did community service, and he agreed to undergo impulse control training. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=116.32s)]
*  Now, it's unclear whether this incident is something that would be troubling in itself [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=121.68s)]
*  to Donald Trump, given his own legal history and given the fact that this was not the first time [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=126.4s)]
*  this same guy had been charged with battery even just since he'd been working for Donald Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=132.64s)]
*  Um, but the Benihana groping and drink throwing incident did pose at least one definite problem. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=138.16s)]
*  The couple who had given the big donation to the super PAC, whereupon the wife of the couple [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=147.28s)]
*  got rewarded for that by Corey Lewandowski, allegedly grabbing her and swearing at her and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=152.0s)]
*  telling her all about the size of his little Lewandowski, that couple reportedly said they [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=157.6s)]
*  wanted a refund of their money if Lewandowski stayed on as the head of the super PAC. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=162.8s)]
*  But they said if Lewandowski was fired from the super PAC, then Trump could keep the money. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=168.72s)]
*  It may or may not surprise you to learn that a decision was made to keep the money and fire [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=175.12s)]
*  Lewandowski, whereupon the Trump super PAC needed a new replacement to run the Trump super PAC. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  And that was the first time that Pam Bondi was given a job by Donald Trump, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=189.84s)]
*  because Donald Trump needed an emergency replacement for his first choice for the job, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=194.48s)]
*  because that guy got in trouble for doing something totally disgusting involving women. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=199.2s)]
*  Pam! Pam! Where's Pam? Pam, I'm gonna need you! [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=205.44s)]
*  The first time was taken over Trump's super PAC after the Benihana gropa donor talk about [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=210.88s)]
*  Benihana gropa donor talk about your penis size incident. The second time is now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, her choice to be attorney general of the United States. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=222.56s)]
*  Trump's first choice for the attorney general job, he denies all wrongdoing, but a congressional [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=226.56s)]
*  ethics committee investigation, quote, concluded there was substantial evidence that Representative [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  Matt Gaetz violated House rules and state and federal laws and other standards of conduct [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=237.84s)]
*  prohibiting acceptance of impermissible gifts, the provision of special favors and privileges, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=243.92s)]
*  obstruction of Congress, illicit drug use, prostitution, and statutory rape. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=249.28s)]
*  Is there nothing he can't do? The Matt Gaetz attorney general nomination lasted eight days [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=256.96s)]
*  and then collapsed under the weight of the whereupon Donald Trump knew what to do. Pam! [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=263.68s)]
*  Where's Pam? Pam? One more time. That's thing number one. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=270.64s)]
*  Thing number two. Why has Pam Bondi been available to repeatedly take jobs on an emergency basis [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=277.52s)]
*  after Trump's first choice was found to have done something very wrong involving his pants? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  Funny story about that, actually. When Trump was elected the first time, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=289.44s)]
*  multiple news organizations reported that he was considering Pam Bondi for a job in his new [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=292.8s)]
*  administration. Maybe he was considering her for a big job, but she never got a job in the first [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=298.24s)]
*  Trump term. She never got any job. Why is that? Some reporting has suggested that it was because, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=304.56s)]
*  quote, Trump staffers were concerned that questions about the donation would make confirmation [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=311.28s)]
*  hearings for Bondi difficult and damaging. Questions about the donation. The donation [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  in question is this one. This $25,000 check. When Pam Bondi was serving as attorney general [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=326.0s)]
*  in Florida, the Orlando Sentinel reported that her office was looking into Floridian's complaints [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=334.56s)]
*  about something called Trump University. Florida residents, a whole bunch of them, had come to the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=340.08s)]
*  state attorney general's office complaining to Pam Bondi that they had been scammed by Trump [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=346.96s)]
*  University. They had lost a ton of money. Could the attorney general please do something about it? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=353.52s)]
*  Now, that report, Bondi's office looking into complaints about possible fraud, Florida may [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=358.24s)]
*  join multi-state lawsuit against Trump University. That report appeared in the press in Florida [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=365.76s)]
*  on a Friday. Four days later, Tuesday, that big, beautiful check arrived. That $25,000 check arrived [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=372.4s)]
*  at the Super PAC supporting Pam Bondi's reelection in Florida. A check signed by [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=382.24s)]
*  Donald Trump himself. Bondi had asked Trump for the donation. The check from the Donald J. Trump [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=387.92s)]
*  Foundation arrived, signed by Trump himself. She also apparently got a check from Ivanka Trump as [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=396.72s)]
*  well. And, you know, what are you going to do? Pam Bondi, thereupon, decided, actually, on second [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=402.32s)]
*  thought, I don't think Florida is going to join that multi-state fraud lawsuit against Trump [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=410.32s)]
*  University after all. Now, incidentally, that lawsuit against Trump University was successful. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  Other states, like New York, went ahead with it. Trump had to shut down his fake university and pay [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=422.96s)]
*  more than $20 million to make the fraud claims go away. Incidentally, he also had to pay a fine to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=429.84s)]
*  the IRS because the check he sent to Pam Bondi while she was mulling whether or not to join the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=436.8s)]
*  case, that turned out to have been an illegal contribution from his fake charity, his fake [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=441.36s)]
*  charity, which was also soon shut down as a scam. Ah, law and order. I love these guys. Law and order. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=447.04s)]
*  A review ultimately cleared Pam Bondi. A state prosecutor officially said it wasn't a bribe. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=455.44s)]
*  But that fiasco obviously got a lot of press. And that was in 2013. So maybe by 2017, the new [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=461.52s)]
*  Trump administration rolls around. Maybe they just didn't want to sit through confirmation hearings [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=474.64s)]
*  for Pam Bondi that would air out all that dirty laundry. That said, it might also have been thing [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=478.96s)]
*  number three that explains why she didn't get a job in the first Trump administration. Because the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=486.96s)]
*  other thing Pam Bondi was really famous for at the time was the execution thing. Now, I don't want to [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=492.64s)]
*  sell her short. Pam Bondi, as Florida attorney general, she was involved in a lot of, a lot of [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=500.32s)]
*  high profile and controversial things. Pam Bondi, for example, was the lead attorney general fighting [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=506.96s)]
*  nationwide to get rid of Obamacare. She led a fight specifically against the part of Obamacare [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=512.48s)]
*  that says you can still get health insurance if you have a preexisting condition like, you know, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=518.0s)]
*  cancer. Pam Bondi was also involved in a weird incident where she started moonlighting from the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=523.44s)]
*  Florida attorney general job by hosting a Fox News show repeatedly for days on end while she was also [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=529.28s)]
*  serving supposedly full time as the top law enforcement official in her state. When that [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=536.48s)]
*  moonlighting tripped the WTF meter in the state and people started asking about it, Fox News insisted [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=542.16s)]
*  that the Ethics Commission in Florida had signed off on her moonlighting and doing this TV thing. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  The Ethics Commission itself said in fact they had not. Pam Bondi also became the face of Florida's [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=555.2s)]
*  particularly vociferous effort to make it illegal for gay people to get married. She said gay [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=563.44s)]
*  marriage harmed the state of Florida. That led to a particularly epic takedown of Ms. Bondi on air [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=569.44s)]
*  by the great Anderson Cooper at CNN. When she was first campaigning for office, Florida's efforts to [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=575.2800000000001s)]
*  not just ban marriage but also ban gay people from adopting. Those efforts had been set back [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=581.12s)]
*  really embarrassingly because of a big just mortifying scandal involving the state's highly [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  paid big expert on the subject of gay adoption. It was the contention of this expert, the state [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  of Florida's paid expert on the gay adoption issue, that a person can choose whether or not they're [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=604.32s)]
*  gay. He said in effect that if you feel gay but you don't want to be gay, that can be fixed. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  You can be cured. Can you? Can you really? Did anybody ask this guy how he knows? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=619.28s)]
*  Because while Pam Bondi was campaigning to become Florida Attorney General, that same guy, that same [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=627.36s)]
*  expert was met at baggage claim at the Miami airport by a Miami New Times reporter who [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  interviewed both the Florida state expert guy and the young man he met on rentboy.com. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=640.88s)]
*  Very handsome young man. The couple was on their way back to Florida from an extended European [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=650.08s)]
*  vacation. Did I mention the young man from rentboy.com was very, very handsome? Now this story [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=656.48s)]
*  got a ton of press in Florida for all the obvious reasons, but Pam Bondi nevertheless pledged [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=664.8s)]
*  to plow on with the gay adoption ban case, which had been based on confident assurances from the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=670.8s)]
*  state of Florida's paid expert who says no one's really gay if they don't want to be. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=677.28s)]
*  The same guy reportedly paying the young man he met at rentboy.com for daily nude massages. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=683.1999999999999s)]
*  So again, I don't want to sell Pam Bondi short. She was involved in a lot of hair, brain, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=691.52s)]
*  controversial stuff while serving as Attorney General in Florida. But if there was one thing [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=696.16s)]
*  that stuck to her from her time in office in Florida, it was the execution thing. The state [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=700.48s)]
*  of Florida is famously enthusiastic about capital punishment. Florida, generally speaking, kills [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=706.08s)]
*  a lot of their prisoners. And Pam Bondi wanted more. She was a big supporter of something called [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=712.72s)]
*  the Timely Justice Act, which aimed to speed up how quickly Florida can kill more of its prisoners. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=720.0s)]
*  That made for some really awkward questions when Pam Bondi, champion of killing prisoners faster, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=727.12s)]
*  nevertheless asked for a delay in one scheduled killing. Turns out she was not available to attend [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=733.28s)]
*  to the execution or to attend to her responsibilities around the execution because she had a fundraiser to [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  go to. Well, perhaps it was a fundraiser for a very good cause. Your mileage may vary. Turns out [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=747.2s)]
*  it was a fundraiser for herself, a fundraising, quote, re-election kickoff reception. For Pam Bondi, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=754.16s)]
*  it is incredibly important that the state of Florida be able to swiftly execute its death row [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=763.28s)]
*  prisoners in a timely manner unless she has plans. And she had plans. That fundraiser, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=768.48s)]
*  just so you know, was more than a year before she was up for re-election. At the time, she had nobody [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=775.76s)]
*  even running against her. But she nevertheless thought that her kickoff reception was more [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=780.48s)]
*  important than the killing she was supposed to oversee, which led to headlines like this one, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=785.12s)]
*  quote, only in Florida, Attorney General Bondi reschedules execution to avoid conflict with her [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=792.08s)]
*  fundraiser. The head of one Florida public interest group said at the time, quote, wherever one stands [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=798.48s)]
*  on the death penalty, there isn't anyone in America that believes an execution should be [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=805.52s)]
*  postponed for political fundraising. Her moral compass is broken. Pam Bondi ultimately apologized [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  for having delayed the execution. But even that left behind more epic Florida headlines, quote, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=818.4s)]
*  Attorney General vows to never again delay an execution for a fundraiser. Never again. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  So maybe that was why she didn't get a job in the first Trump administration. I don't know. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=832.08s)]
*  But that brings us to thing number four. Despite never actually getting a job in the first Donald [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=836.8s)]
*  Trump administration, Pam Bondi has stuck herself to Donald Trump like a persistent cough. At his [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=842.56s)]
*  low moments, at his worst moments, she was involved more than people tend to remember. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=849.6s)]
*  For example, there she was at the Republican National Convention. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=856.48s)]
*  Donald Trump will stop it. Lock her up. I love that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=860.16s)]
*  Saying, yeah, lock her up. I love that. There she was at the Stormy Daniels hush money trial, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=869.76s)]
*  standing outside the courtroom, attacking the judge in the case. She came on the same day Joe [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=877.1999999999999s)]
*  Piscopo did. There she was the day after the 2020 election, firing some of the very first shots [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=882.4s)]
*  in the war to overthrow that election. Pam Bondi held the very first overturn the election press [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=888.8s)]
*  conference in Pennsylvania. That was the one where Rudy Giuliani said some ballots might have come, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=895.76s)]
*  quote, from Mars. There she was just days later at Four Seasons Total Landscaping, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=900.64s)]
*  where Ms. Bondi reportedly oversaw the moving of the landscaping equipment to make room for the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=909.3599999999999s)]
*  podium. There she was on Fox News, insisting falsely that Trump had won, making wild enough [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=914.96s)]
*  claims about what she called fake ballots, that even the Fox News morning show hosts pushed back, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=920.88s)]
*  quote, just tell us what you know. Pam, Pam. At Donald Trump's first impeachment, there she was on [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=928.48s)]
*  the defense team, although her job was not so much to defend Trump as to defend the president, but [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=937.9200000000001s)]
*  much to defend Trump as it was to muddy the waters. She was the one on the defense team [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=943.52s)]
*  who was charged with arguing that the real Ukraine scandal was not this impeachment thing. The real [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=949.04s)]
*  Ukraine scandal was a made up fake bribery allegation about President Joe Biden. And we [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=954.72s)]
*  know it is a made up fake claim because here's Pam Bondi with the guy who was the source of that [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=960.72s)]
*  claim, who himself now says the allegation was not only made up, it was made up by people [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=966.88s)]
*  linked to the Kremlin and Russian intelligence. That's where he got it. And then Pam Bondi served [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=972.3199999999999s)]
*  it up to the American people as one of Trump's lawyers. He went to prison. She's going to be [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=979.68s)]
*  attorney general. Which brings us to thing number five. And I don't mean this in a mean way, but [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=986.4s)]
*  just objectively speaking, there are ways in which she is not great at this. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=995.84s)]
*  The Norway trip was June of 2015. He remained on the board [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1003.36s)]
*  until [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1014.0s)]
*  April of 2019. Part of Pam Bondi's responsibilities when defending Trump in his first impeachment [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1014.64s)]
*  was not just to speak in Congress on his behalf. That didn't always go great. But it was also her [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1034.16s)]
*  job to make the case for him on television. And that also often did not go well. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1041.44s)]
*  And yesterday we know Gordon Sondland. Well, are they in frequent contact? Have they been? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1048.24s)]
*  Well, we're going to hear what Gordon Sondland has to say today. He was he's in that. What does [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1052.96s)]
*  the president for a short while? The president, he was ambassador to the Ukraine. He is ambassador [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1057.6000000000001s)]
*  to the Ukraine. And the president knows him. The president does not know him very well. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1063.28s)]
*  He's a short term ambassador. Of course he knows him. He's the ambassador. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1068.3999999999999s)]
*  He's the ambassador to the Ukraine. He's not the ambassador to the Ukraine, the Ukraine or Ukraine. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1071.84s)]
*  That guy had an entirely different job. Headline. Trump's top impeachment defender gets Sondland's [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1081.04s)]
*  job title wrong three times. Pam Bondi's selection to be attorney general of the United States [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1089.1999999999998s)]
*  has been overshadowed by the circumstances in which she was selected for this job. I mean, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1097.76s)]
*  even very fierce Trump critics have effectively praised her just because she is not perceived [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1103.9199999999998s)]
*  to be as bad as the guy who she replaced. Not as bad as Trump's first choice for attorney general. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1111.84s)]
*  Like take, for example, former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1120.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, better than Gates. I mean, you know, a bag filled with peanut butter would be [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1124.72s)]
*  better than Gates. So, you know, that's a it's a low bar. Pam Bondi is better than Matt Gates, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1129.6799999999998s)]
*  but also a bag filled with peanut butter is better than Matt Gates. So consider the scale here. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1135.9199999999998s)]
*  One outspoken critic of Pam Bondi's from Florida said in the Orlando Sentinel quote, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1142.96s)]
*  compared to Matt Gates, Pam Bondi looks like Clarence freaking Darrow. Emphasis in the original. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1147.6s)]
*  Rachel Maddusho producer Steve Bannon, who was a man not prone to hyperbole, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1154.32s)]
*  he said memorably about her selection, quote, it would be effectively impossible to pick someone [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1158.32s)]
*  more repulsive than Matt Gates. So as a person who's definitely less repulsive than the most [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1164.6399999999999s)]
*  repulsive choice imaginable, I mean, congratulations, Pam Bondi. Congratulations, Pam. Where's Pam? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1172.8s)]
*  Pam Bondi is one of four of his own personal defense lawyers that Donald Trump is trying to [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1180.08s)]
*  install at the top of the Justice Department. And the way she appears to have earned this [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1187.4399999999998s)]
*  nomination is by defending and participating with Trump in the defense of the country. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1191.76s)]
*  And she's a very, very good lawyer. And she's a very, very good lawyer. And she's a very, very [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1196.96s)]
*  good lawyer. And she's a very, very good lawyer. And she's a very, very good lawyer. And she's a [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1202.0s)]
*  She says that the people at the Justice Department who prosecuted Trump for his alleged crimes [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1207.68s)]
*  will themselves be prosecuted now. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1211.68s)]
*  As attorney general, she will be in a position to do that. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1215.92s)]
*  And as an attorney general, she will be in a position to do that. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1219.6000000000001s)]
*  And she says that she's going to be a good lawyer. And she's a very, very good lawyer. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1224.88s)]
*  And she says that she's going to be a good lawyer. And she says that she's going to be a good [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1229.8400000000001s)]
*  to do that. She was not his first choice for this job. She was the emergency replacement, again. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1235.36s)]
*  But that really isn't the most important thing to know about Pam Bondi as our potential next [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1242.32s)]
*  attorney general, which is why this has been another Rachel Maddow show public servant announcement. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1247.84s)]
*  you [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igOCeeJmnSw&t=1265.36s)]
