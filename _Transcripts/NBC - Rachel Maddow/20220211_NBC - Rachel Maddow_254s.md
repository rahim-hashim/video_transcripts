# War Is Avoidable (If Putin Wants It)
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4)
*  Joining us now is Michael McFaul. He served as the United States Ambassador to Russia under President Obama. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=0.0s)]
*  His new piece today in Foreign Affairs is titled, How to Make a Deal with Putin. Only a comprehensive pact can avoid war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=5.0s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for being with us tonight. It is an important and crucial time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=12.0s)]
*  You have a suggestion on the table. Your article actually suggests there's a way out of this. What does it look like? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=17.0s)]
*  Well, Ali, first I want to say I'm not optimistic that my proposal would be accepted by Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=23.0s)]
*  I want to be clear about that. But I think if Putin wants to negotiate about European security and not just about small things and not about things that we cannot do, like closing the door to NATO forever, that will never happen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=29.0s)]
*  There's a lot of concrete things that American, Russian, Canadian, European negotiators could do. I call it Helsinki 2.0 because Helsinki was signed in 1975. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=44.0s)]
*  By the way, when we were in a very confrontational relationship with the Communist Soviet Union, we had many disagreements around the world. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=55.0s)]
*  Remember, communists had just taken over in Southeast Asia and southern Africa. And yet in that context, we managed to negotiate. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=63.0s)]
*  It took several years, a treaty that made European, all of Europe safer. And that's basically what I wrote about. And I think that's on offer if Putin decides he wants to negotiate. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=70.0s)]
*  Let me read a little bit from that suggestion about what you were just talking about at Helsinki. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=82.0s)]
*  You said, to launch these ambitious negotiations, all OSCE leaders, Biden and Putin included, could meet in Helsinki this year. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=86.0s)]
*  The countries would then station special envoys there dedicated to hashing out a new agreement. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=94.0s)]
*  Their work would be complemented by negotiations at the OSCE headquarters in Vienna, the NATO-Russian Council in Brussels, and in bilateral U.S.-Russian channels. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=100.0s)]
*  Diplomats could aim to complete their final product by 2025, the 50th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=109.0s)]
*  This seems like a really reasonable approach to people who have been longtime combatants looking for a solution. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=115.0s)]
*  Maybe something like that could work with Israel and the Palestinians. Does this meet the goals that Putin has right now? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=121.0s)]
*  Is he not enjoying the fact that we are all talking about this and not sure about what he's going to do? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=127.0s)]
*  Yes and no. So, yes, he's enjoying all the attention, right? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=133.0s)]
*  He's enjoying all these phone calls, all the visitors, and he's really enjoying the fact that this frame that he put on this crisis about NATO expansion is what a lot of us are spending a time arguing about. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=138.0s)]
*  We're not arguing about annexation of Crimea, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=150.0s)]
*  We're not arguing about the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia from 2008. He loves that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=153.0s)]
*  But I actually do think if he wants to negotiate, there are real things we can do in terms of transparency, pulling our soldiers back, maybe limiting some weapons. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=163.0s)]
*  But we can't meet his maximalist demands, right? We can't entertain the idea of closing NATO's door. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=174.0s)]
*  And by the way, he probably won't meet our maximalist demands of leaving Crimea anytime soon. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=181.0s)]
*  So sometimes in negotiations, you have to agree to disagree about maximalist positions. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=187.0s)]
*  That's what we did during the START negotiations with the Russians when I was in the government. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=192.0s)]
*  You agree to disagree, you write them down in side letters, and then you try to find some agreement about the limited things that you can agree on based on reciprocity and mutual interest. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=197.0s)]
*  And I think on European security, there are some issues where we could agree with the Russians if Vladimir Putin wants to negotiate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=208.0s)]
*  And I want to emphasize, I don't think he does. But if he does, I think there's a way forward. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=215.0s)]
*  And that is the great unknown, but it is the unknown in which people like you throw yourselves into because diplomacy is always better than the alternative. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=221.0s)]
*  Michael McQuall, thank you for being with us, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia under President Obama. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=229.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Oo9maxomW4&t=238.0s)]
