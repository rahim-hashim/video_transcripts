# Key twist in Trump's 'catch and kill' scheme will be hard for him to explain away
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I)
*  Now, as Lawrence O'Donnell just mentioned, today was the first time that we've heard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=0.0s)]
*  from the defense. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=4.88s)]
*  We've heard from the prosecution, in effect, with the indictment, with the announcement [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=5.88s)]
*  of charges that led to today's proceedings. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=11.6s)]
*  But this is the first time we got to see the defense go through their paces. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=14.44s)]
*  For the defense counsel for former President Trump, we did get a sense in their opening [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=19.16s)]
*  statements today about how it looks like they're going to try to defend their client. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=23.0s)]
*  If today's opening statements are any guide, they're going to stress that Mr. Trump is [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=27.36s)]
*  a former president, and they're going to always call him President Trump. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=32.22s)]
*  They're going to stress beyond that, that he right now is the presumptive Republican [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=36.16s)]
*  nominee for president again, or, as his defense counsel called him today, the Republican nominee, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=40.42s)]
*  not even presumptive. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  They're going to claim that every aspect of this was an innocent act by Trump, that there [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  an underlying sexual encounter to cover up, even though that would seem to be immaterial [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  to the charges. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  They will seem to be claiming, again, if today's opening statements are any guide, that Michael [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=59.46s)]
*  Cohen, Trump's lawyer, paid a porn star on his own accord and for his own reasons, that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=63.6s)]
*  Trump only paid Michael Cohen for legal services just like he always had. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=70.8s)]
*  He just changed to a weird new way of paying him after the porn star thing, because, well, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=75.56s)]
*  they'll think of something. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=80.36s)]
*  But if you were in this defense team, if you were in charge of coming up with a defense [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=83.44s)]
*  for Mr. Trump, here's the part of the prosecution's case that would seem to be the most difficult [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=87.48s)]
*  thing to explain logically. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=93.42s)]
*  If you're really going to try to mount a defense that Trump did nothing at all wrong, that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=96.68s)]
*  there was no conspiracy to corrupt the election, as the prosecution put it at the top of their [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=100.12s)]
*  opening statements today. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=105.08s)]
*  Well, this would seem to be the toughest thing logically that you're up against. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=106.64s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=112.84s)]
*  This is from the opening statement from prosecutor Matthew Colangelo. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=113.84s)]
*  Colangelo, quote, now with this, oh, sorry, this is not quoting it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=116.88s)]
*  Forgive me. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=122.2s)]
*  This is the introduction. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=123.2s)]
*  At this point, Colangelo has explained to the jury that there was what he called a criminal [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=124.2s)]
*  conspiracy between Trump and AMI American media to publish positive stories about Trump, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=127.2s)]
*  to publish negative stories about Trump's rivals, to find negative stories about Trump [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=133.32s)]
*  that hadn't been published yet, and then to pay the sources of those stories to make them [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=137.4s)]
*  shut up and not tell anybody about those stories before the election. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=142.52s)]
*  So the prosecution has explained to the jury at this point that AMI American media, National [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=145.88s)]
*  Enquirer, they first found a doorman, a doorman named Dino, Dino Sejudin, who said that Trump [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=150.8s)]
*  had fathered a secret child with a housekeeper. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=158.56s)]
*  Sejudin was the first one that AMI paid to keep quiet about his story. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=161.28s)]
*  Then there was a second one, a woman named Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=165.84s)]
*  with Trump. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=169.36s)]
*  They paid her to not tell anybody about that story as well. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=170.36s)]
*  Then there was the third one, Stormy Daniels. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=173.68s)]
*  And although by this point, the inquirer was still willing to make arrangements for her [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=175.56s)]
*  to be paid to be quiet about that story, by that point, they were not ready to put up [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=180.4s)]
*  additional money. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  And so Michael Cohen put up the money for that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=186.6s)]
*  So the prosecutors explained all this to the jury. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=188.76s)]
*  And then he says this, prosecutor Matthew Colangelo, quote, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  It was election fraud, pure and simple. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=218.76s)]
*  We will never know, and it doesn't matter if this conspiracy was the difference maker [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=231.32s)]
*  in a close election. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  But you will see evidence in the defendant's own words from his social media posts, from [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=237.72s)]
*  the speeches at campaign rallies and other events. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=242.64s)]
*  You will see in his own words, making crystal clear that he was certainly concerned about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=245.64s)]
*  how all of this could hurt his standing with voters and with female voters in particular. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=249.44s)]
*  You will also see evidence that on election night, as news outlets got closer to calling [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=253.92s)]
*  the election for Donald Trump, the lawyer for both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=259.14s)]
*  texted Dylan Howard, an editor at the National Enquirer, and he said, quote, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=264.2s)]
*  What have we done? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=269.0s)]
*  And about a month after the election, David Pecker, the CEO of American Media, then authorized [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=272.16s)]
*  AMI to release both Dino Sijudin, the doorman, and Karen McDougal from their nondisclosure [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=277.44s)]
*  agreements. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=285.36s)]
*  Say that again. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  About a month after the election, Pecker authorized AMI to release the first two recipients [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=288.20000000000005s)]
*  of catch and kill money, release them from their nondisclosure agreements once the election [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  was over. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=299.68s)]
*  Colangelo, quote. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=300.68s)]
*  So having paid for the stories in order to keep them from the public before election [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=301.88s)]
*  day, Pecker and AMI then told both McDougal and Sijudin a month after the election that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=305.48s)]
*  they were no longer bound by the nondisclosure agreements. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=310.2s)]
*  So just think about what that means. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=314.52s)]
*  This claim, right, from the defense is that none of these payment schemes had anything [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  to do with the election. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=321.88s)]
*  Who knows what Michael Cohen was doing paying that porn star? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=322.88s)]
*  Donald Trump was just paying for legal fees, right? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=325.68s)]
*  The defense is saying it had nothing to do with the election. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=328.6s)]
*  The prosecution says they will present evidence that Trump and American media paid for all [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=330.76s)]
*  of these people to be silent until the election was over. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=335.96s)]
*  And then once the election was over, they then released all these people from these [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=341.08s)]
*  agreements to be silent because once the election happened, they didn't care anymore because [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=343.96s)]
*  at that point, mission accomplished because the mission was to influence the election. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=349.32s)]
*  And so once the election was done, there's no more need for these agreements. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=355.64s)]
*  The mission was the election. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=359.32s)]
*  The mission was not to protect his brand. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=361.48s)]
*  The mission wasn't to save his family embarrassment. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=364.36s)]
*  It was to keep these people silent, to pay them to be silent specifically and only in [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  order to win the election full stop. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=373.68s)]
*  The prosecution calls this a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=376.8s)]
*  one that was covered up by lying in these business records. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=382.92s)]
*  Logically, that releasing people from the agreements once the election was over, logically [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=387.28s)]
*  that would seem to be the crux of this case if the prosecution can prove it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  Legally though, we'll see. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  Lawrence? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=401.4s)]
*  So Rachel, here we arrive at the different burdens of prosecution and defense. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=402.4s)]
*  The prosecution is going for logic and you are following their logic and their logic [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=407.79999999999995s)]
*  And then it takes you over to the National Enquirer and it takes you over to this guy [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=413.56s)]
*  who told the Enquirer that Trump fathered a child. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=417.64s)]
*  That turns out not to be true. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=422.16s)]
*  Everyone in the courtroom agrees that that wasn't true. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=423.6s)]
*  And then it takes you over to Karen McDougall and those are the two who are released from [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=426.94s)]
*  their confidentiality agreement after the election. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=431.68s)]
*  And what the defense is going to say in final argument is that has nothing to do with this [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=434.08s)]
*  case, absolutely nothing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=439.52s)]
*  Because remember what the defense needs in final argument is not logic. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=443.06s)]
*  They're not trying to take you through a flawlessly logical story. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  They're just trying to tug at any little doubt they can find anywhere. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=451.68s)]
*  And they will lean in final argument on that agreement in that courtroom. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=457.66s)]
*  That that guy who said, who told the Enquirer that Donald Trump illegitimately fathered [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=464.06s)]
*  a child was not telling the truth. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=469.08s)]
*  Wasn't telling the truth. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=471.36s)]
*  Like Stormy Daniels wasn't telling the truth about Donald Trump. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=472.38s)]
*  And Donald Trump gets hustled by these people all the time and we have to deal with them [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=475.34000000000003s)]
*  in different ways. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=479.26s)]
*  Donald Trump has said publicly, this happens to every man, every man, includes you Chris [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=480.26s)]
*  Hayes sitting at this table, every man who's public, every man who's in the public eye [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=487.22s)]
*  is constantly paying off tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of these deals all the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=492.78000000000003s)]
*  time. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=498.86s)]
*  That's Donald Trump's claim, right? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=499.86s)]
*  And he's going to say, you know, this was happening to me all the time. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=500.88s)]
*  And, and, and all of that McDougal stuff, everything involving Pecker, everything involving [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  the Enquirer is going to be thrown out the door in the final argument of Donald Trump's [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=509.44s)]
*  defense lawyers because none of that is a charged crime. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=514.16s)]
*  Not a single thing in any of that. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=517.32s)]
*  It's these business records. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=519.72s)]
*  And the other piece of the defense that we heard today about the business records is [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=521.28s)]
*  this is the name of the woman who made up, you know, the checks. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=525.76s)]
*  This is the name of the bookkeeper, centered in the record, who filled out the forms. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=529.64s)]
*  This is the name of the person who told her to say legal services. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=534.86s)]
*  And Donald Trump never told any of them to say legal services. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=538.74s)]
*  That's the defense. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=543.34s)]
*  Donald Trump didn't tell them to keep the books this way. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=544.34s)]
*  And the money, oh, by the way, was not for having anything to do with Stormy Daniels. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=547.62s)]
*  That's the entire defense. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=552.14s)]
*  There's no other piece of the defense. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=553.42s)]
*  And it has nothing to do with other people's, you know, non-disclosure agreements and all [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=555.34s)]
*  that stuff. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=561.2800000000001s)]
*  And of course, all of that stuff makes perfect sense when a prosecution is building you this [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=562.2800000000001s)]
*  flawless table that has logical, four logical legs to it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=568.36s)]
*  Defense is going to come along and say, no, it has no legs. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=574.1600000000001s)]
*  The table has no legs. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=577.08s)]
*  We released all these people from these agreements after the election because we love late-night [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=580.32s)]
*  November. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=585.32s)]
*  And that's a time when we release everyone from their agreements. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=586.32s)]
*  Merry Christmas. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=588.96s)]
*  It's a time of freedom. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=589.96s)]
*  They're going to feel no need. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=590.96s)]
*  The defense will feel no need to explain at all why those non-disclosure agreements are [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=591.96s)]
*  no longer enforceable. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=597.4000000000001s)]
*  They won't have any need to when they're in their final argument. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  They'll throw something out there in the course of the trial, but they won't feel compelled [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=601.48s)]
*  to explain. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=604.82s)]
*  Well, what you're talking about, about the claim from Dino the doorman being a false [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=605.82s)]
*  claim, what AMI nevertheless agreed to pay for it, and what Michael Cohen was paid and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=610.46s)]
*  how they arrived at that amount was the snort your coffee out your nose in the courtroom [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=616.82s)]
*  moment today. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=622.38s)]
*  We're going to talk about that, including with Andrew Weissman and Katherine Christian, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=623.38s)]
*  who are here, who are keeping us on the legal straight and narrow as we proceed with our [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=627.34s)]
*  recap of today's criminal proceedings against former president Donald Trump. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21pIw-0UZ1I&t=633.5s)]
