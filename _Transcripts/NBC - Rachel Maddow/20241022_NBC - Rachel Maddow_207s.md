# Maddow: 'History is calling!' Last chance to play a role in hugely consequential election
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE)
*  So we are two weeks out from Election Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's two weeks from tomorrow. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=2.5s)]
*  Well over 10 million Americans have already cast their ballots, myself included. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=4.3s)]
*  It feels great to have voted. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=9.6s)]
*  I highly recommend it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=12.3s)]
*  No feeling quite like it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=13.8s)]
*  But now we are getting close to the point where we are out of time for anything but voting. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=16.9s)]
*  Whatever you want to be able to say you did in this year's election, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=23.0s)]
*  whatever you want to be able to brag about someday in the future, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=27.0s)]
*  whatever you want to say you're proud you did when your country needed you, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=29.9s)]
*  you know, what you want your answer to be when somebody someday asks you what you did in 2024 [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=36.4s)]
*  when you were alive and American and fully aware that this was the highest stakes American election since 1940 and 1860. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=42.7s)]
*  Whatever you want to be able to brag about in terms of your contribution to this moment in American history, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=53.1s)]
*  your contribution to this election, this election in which we are being asked to choose [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=58.6s)]
*  not just between one candidate and the other, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  we are being asked to choose between one system of government and another. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=66.4s)]
*  Whatever you want your family lore about you to be for future generations of your family [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=72.6s)]
*  when your family in future holidays, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=79.0s)]
*  Future family reunions, family get-togethers, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=82.3s)]
*  when members of your family generations yet to come talk about you and what you did in the election [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=86.5s)]
*  that decided whether or not America was going to switch to a strongman authoritarian state [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=91.5s)]
*  instead of the system we were born to and grew up in. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=97.0s)]
*  Whatever you are going to do, it's what you're going to do now. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=101.3s)]
*  And in these next two weeks, history is calling. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  So what are you going to do? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=112.0s)]
*  Whether it's calling voters and swing states, volunteering to knock on doors, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=113.8s)]
*  volunteering to drive people to the polls, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=118.69999999999999s)]
*  showing up at the local campaign office of your candidate or your cause [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=121.1s)]
*  and offering to do whatever needs doing at this late date. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=125.3s)]
*  Just on your own calling or texting everyone in your contact list in your phone, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=129.4s)]
*  asking everyone you know if they are registered to vote, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=135.3s)]
*  if they need any help getting to a polling place to cast that ballot. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=137.70000000000002s)]
*  And can you please help them? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=140.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean, whatever you want your bragging rights to be about doing your part. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=142.70000000000002s)]
*  This is the last two weeks to do any of it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=147.10000000000002s)]
*  Voting is the bare minimum. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=150.4s)]
*  You don't even get to brag about that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=152.5s)]
*  What else are you going to do on top of voting to help bring about the outcome that you want in this election? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  The answer to that question is whatever you sign up to do tonight and tomorrow. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  Because we are otherwise out of time. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=168.89999999999998s)]
*  Watching TV doesn't count. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  Worrying about polls doesn't count. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=173.7s)]
*  Scrolling through your phone and doing nothing other than absorbing information does not count. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  It's time to actually do something. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=181.1s)]
*  And really, it's now or never. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5E0iwrBULE&t=183.39999999999998s)]
