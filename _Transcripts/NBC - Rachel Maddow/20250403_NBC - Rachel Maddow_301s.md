# Needless economic pain from Trump not even worth it if his tariff gambit works: Economist
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8)
*  And tonight, joining us now, Betsy Stevenson, the former chief economist of the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=0.0s)]
*  Department of Labor under President Obama. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=4.96s)]
*  Betsy, it's great to have you on the show with the perspective and insight of an economist. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=6.96s)]
*  Talk to me about what you think these tariffs will actually mean for viewers at home. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=10.76s)]
*  We touched on this a little bit with Vaughn right now, but for ordinary Americans, explain [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=15.64s)]
*  to us how this will actually impact them, both in the short term and in the long term. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=20.62s)]
*  Well, obviously, ordinary Americans who are relying on their savings retirees are already [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=25.840000000000003s)]
*  seeing that they're taking hits to what they have. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=31.76s)]
*  But I think what we're really going to see is price increases, and they will happen pretty [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=35.32s)]
*  quickly. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=40.44s)]
*  We might not see them tomorrow. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=41.56s)]
*  We might not even see them next week. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=42.84s)]
*  But I think within the end of the month, if these tariffs stick, I don't think that—there [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  are a lot of companies out there that aren't going to be able to withstand paying these [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=48.8s)]
*  tariffs without passing it on to their customers quite quickly. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=53.28s)]
*  So I think we're going to see a spike in prices and inflation, and we already see that in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=57.68000000000001s)]
*  the data on inflation expectations. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=64.36s)]
*  So people are expecting inflation to be higher. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=67.08s)]
*  And then what we can see—we will also see is layoffs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=69.76s)]
*  We're going to see an economy that—where economic growth is slowing. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=73.44s)]
*  Will it slow all the way to the point of a recession? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=79.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=82.0s)]
*  I think it's more likely than not. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=83.8s)]
*  But what we do know for sure is we're not going to have the kind of robust growth that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=84.8s)]
*  we've seen over the last couple of years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=90.52s)]
*  I think we're going to see that start to slow down. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=92.56s)]
*  And so what you're going to see is, for ordinary people, more of your friends and family who [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  don't have access to jobs, higher prices when you go to the grocery store, when you go to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=99.48s)]
*  buy clothing or you go to buy ordinary items. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=104.2s)]
*  And I think that's going to stick around for quite some time. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=108.0s)]
*  So, let me—if I were to say, like, this conversation was happening with Republicans, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  and certainly the administration has been making this argument, they say short-term [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=114.72s)]
*  pain for long-term gain. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  They make the argument that by creating these tariffs, we're going to see an increase in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=120.48s)]
*  manufacturing here in the United States. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=125.2s)]
*  What is the validity of that argument? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=129.0s)]
*  And is there any truth to increasing these tariffs will somehow compel American companies, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  whether it's pharmaceutical companies or automobile manufacturers, to suddenly overnight [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=136.76s)]
*  get these plants up and running, create jobs and produce goods that are going to be cheaper [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  than what is coming in from overseas? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=146.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=149.64s)]
*  First, we'll start with overnight. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=150.64s)]
*  They can't do it overnight even if they wanted to. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  They're not, you know, some magic fairy that blinks their eyes and the factory opens up [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=158.84s)]
*  So this is a long-run investment to open factories in the United States. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=159.84s)]
*  And you need to be thinking about not just what are the tariffs going to be today, but [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=165.45999999999998s)]
*  what are the tariffs going to be over the next 20 or 30 years? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=168.42s)]
*  And then you have to ask yourself, are you really going to be able to produce it cheap [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=171.42s)]
*  enough in the United States that you're better off doing that than just paying the tariffs [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=175.1s)]
*  and continuing with the factories that you've already invested in? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=179.48s)]
*  I don't think that a lot of companies are going to immediately come and invest in the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=182.98s)]
*  United States. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  First of all, we're going to have a slowing economy. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  That's not a great investment environment. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=191.78s)]
*  We're also going to have less stable prices with higher inflation, also not the best environment [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=195.78s)]
*  for investing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=201.86s)]
*  But let's put some numbers on all of this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=202.86s)]
*  We have 13 million Americans who work in manufacturing, and we have 123 million Americans who work [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=205.74s)]
*  in the private sector, not for government, the private sector, in non-manufacturing jobs. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=214.08s)]
*  You know, yes, maybe we get. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=219.74s)]
*  But let's say that he is vindicated and we get two million new manufacturing jobs. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=222.61999999999998s)]
*  So we go from having 13 million to 15 million. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=229.1s)]
*  What if they come at the expense of those other 123 million jobs? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=232.1s)]
*  How many of those do we lose? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=236.7s)]
*  And it's also worth noting that the typical pay, the average pay in those other jobs is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=238.7s)]
*  higher than what we see in manufacturing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=245.38s)]
*  We're going to be giving up jobs that are worse in order to get these manufacturing jobs. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=248.06s)]
*  So it's even in his best case scenario, where we have higher prices that persist, that we [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=253.06s)]
*  now make very expensive garments, clothing, iPhones in the United States, and many people [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=260.54s)]
*  can't afford them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=267.5s)]
*  So we have smaller sales. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=268.5s)]
*  But those are the kind of jobs that the American public wants. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=270.5s)]
*  The American public wants high-paying jobs, not low-paying, low-skilled assembly jobs. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSqnAbxdVc8&t=274.5s)]
