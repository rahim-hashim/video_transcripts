# Benefits of historic auto union worker contracts redound to non-union labor as well
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk)
*  After a big six-week-long strike this fall, the United Auto Workers announced today that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=0.0s)]
*  their members have voted to ratify the historic new contracts the union was able to negotiate [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  with Ford and GM and Stellantis. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=9.06s)]
*  One of the interesting effects of this strike, though, is how the other auto companies, non-union [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=12.06s)]
*  auto companies, are also giving their workers a raise because of the UAW strike. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=16.78s)]
*  It's almost certainly just about dissuading their own workers from also wanting to join [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=23.42s)]
*  the union, given what the UAW was able to get for their members at other automakers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=27.68s)]
*  But whatever the motivation, a raise is a raise. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=33.92s)]
*  Toyota was the first non-union auto worker to announce a wage increase for their workers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=36.16s)]
*  in the U.S. after the UAW got their deal. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=40.36s)]
*  But now all these non-union automakers are saying the same thing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=42.92s)]
*  Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Subaru now all say they're going to raise wages for their workers [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=45.72s)]
*  too. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  Again, they're trying to keep their workers from joining the union by showing them that [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  they can get a wage raise without being in the union. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=55.04s)]
*  Last week, UAW President Sean Fain told a Senate committee they call this the UAW bump. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=59.5s)]
*  He says in this case, the initials stand for UAW, you are welcome. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=64.48s)]
*  In the past few months, labor unions across a whole bunch of different industries have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=70.24s)]
*  been showing the power of organizing in the workplace, and that is true right here at [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=73.24s)]
*  MSNBC. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=77.36s)]
*  Last week, after more than two years of negotiations, the MSNBC union members of the Writers Guild [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=78.44s)]
*  of America East reached a tentative agreement with management on a first contract. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=84.4s)]
*  Now the union membership is going to vote on whether to accept the deal, but having [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  a tentative agreement feels like a breath of fresh air for everybody in this space. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  Watch this space along with all of us. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3ocK1er6dk&t=101.72s)]
