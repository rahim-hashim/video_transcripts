# 'This is bananas': DOGE looks to finagle a building the federal government doesn't own
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U)
*  Update for you. A couple of weeks ago we covered closely the story of a little agency, an independent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=0.0s)]
*  nonprofit in Washington called the Institute of Peace. The so-called Doge outfit run by [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=6.72s)]
*  President Trump's top campaign donor literally forced their way into this agency in an operation [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  that reportedly involved the FBI, the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=19.88s)]
*  and a private security firm. Bizarrely, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=25.18s)]
*  also threatened the leaders of this Institute of Peace, threatened them with criminal investigation [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=30.5s)]
*  and criminal prosecution. They ultimately called in Washington's Metropolitan Police [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=36.74s)]
*  Force who then physically evicted the staff of the Institute and handed the headquarters [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  over to Elon Musk's so-called Doge team. That is how they got inside. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=47.66s)]
*  Well now, new developments. Late Friday night, these people working for Trump's campaign [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=54.339999999999996s)]
*  donor, Elon Musk, they tried to fire basically all of the employees of this Institute. Two [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=58.78s)]
*  or three hundred people all fired in the wee hours on Friday night. The Washington Post [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=65.72s)]
*  reports that the termination notices that went out late on Friday night were, quote, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=70.02s)]
*  riddled with mistakes, including misspellings of employees' names, a misspelling of the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=74.3s)]
*  Institute's title, and a misspelling of the month of April. I mean, February maybe, but [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=80.30000000000001s)]
*  they can't spell April and they're in charge of destroying the American government? Can't [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=88.30000000000001s)]
*  our cartoonish villains at least be grownups? How about May? Can you guys spell May? The [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=95.66000000000001s)]
*  thing that has always made this story even weirder and wilder than it already obviously [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=106.22s)]
*  is is that the U.S. Institute of Peace isn't like part of the executive branch. It's an [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=110.38s)]
*  independent nonprofit created by Congress over 40 years ago. It's largely funded by [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=116.3s)]
*  its own private endowment. The people who work there aren't federal government employees. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=120.78s)]
*  The U.S. Institute of Peace owns its own headquarters and controls the land the building sits on. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=125.14s)]
*  Apparently now, Donald Trump and his top campaign donor are trying to steal that building. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=132.78s)]
*  Seriously. Included in a court filing tonight is this letter from the 28-year-old Doge [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=137.78s)]
*  Bro, who has been installed as the ostensible new head of this Institute, offering to give [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=145.26s)]
*  the Institute's headquarters building to the General Services Administration, which is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=151.26s)]
*  like the federal government's landlord. Quote, in my capacity as president of the United [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=156.9s)]
*  States Institute of Peace, says Child, quote, I write to request that the General Services [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=161.34s)]
*  Administration accept transfer of excess property of the United States Institute of Peace. I [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=166.34s)]
*  have determined that USIP no longer needs the property. The Institute's ousted leaders [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=172.34s)]
*  have asked a federal judge today to stop Doge and the Trump administration from stealing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=179.46s)]
*  their building. A federal judge in Washington, D.C. has scheduled a hearing on this for tomorrow [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=186.22s)]
*  morning. These guys have done some crazy stuff, but this is bananas. Watch this space. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JCOGP2dU_U&t=192.29999999999998s)]
