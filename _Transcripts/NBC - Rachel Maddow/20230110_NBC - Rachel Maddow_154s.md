# House GOP wants Jordan-led committee to oversee active federal criminal investigations
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE)
*  There's another provision in this deal, though, that I think is kind of a sleeper, that I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=0.0s)]
*  think is worth more notice than it has received so far. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=3.68s)]
*  And that's the provision as part of the new rules package that the Republicans are agreeing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=7.34s)]
*  to, which would create a committee to investigate what they call the weaponization of the federal [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=11.18s)]
*  government. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=17.2s)]
*  This is a committee that's expected to be chaired by Trump Republican Jim Jordan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=18.2s)]
*  And the Republicans claim that this committee would have the power to oversee not just the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=23.5s)]
*  Justice Department and the FBI the way they're usually overseen by Congress. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=27.98s)]
*  They claim this committee, led by Jim Jordan, would have the ability to oversee ongoing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  criminal investigations being conducted by the Justice Department. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=36.54s)]
*  Ongoing criminal investigations like, say, the ongoing criminal investigations into the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=40.900000000000006s)]
*  January 6th attack or the ongoing criminal investigations into former President Donald [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=46.16s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=50.58s)]
*  One member of Congress who says he should be considered for a spot on this committee is [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=52.74s)]
*  Scott Perry, a Trump Republican whose phone was recently seized by the Justice Department [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=56.14s)]
*  as part of their investigation into the January 6th attack. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=62.74s)]
*  This one, as I say, I think is the sleeper. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=66.7s)]
*  If Republicans do go through with this committee to try to create a new system of oversight [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=68.98s)]
*  of the Justice Department that includes their ongoing criminal investigations, I mean, we [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=75.82s)]
*  can't expect that the Justice Department wouldn't just roll over and go along with it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=83.26s)]
*  We could expect that the Justice Department would presumably go to court if need be to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  protect their investigations. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=90.7s)]
*  But what would happen then? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=93.34s)]
*  I mean, what would happen if two branches of our government went to war over active [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  criminal investigations into a former president that could potentially put him in prison? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=99.42s)]
*  What if it gets left to the pro-Trump conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court to settle [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=104.26s)]
*  that conflict? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=110.18s)]
*  As I said, the rules changes, we'll see how they plan out in terms of which pose the most [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=112.14s)]
*  serious threats to sort of regular order and normal small d democratic governance. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=116.18s)]
*  But this effort to try to get members of Congress into the criminal justice system in this specific [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=122.14000000000001s)]
*  way, that's by my bet, really the one to watch. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jfOG14MfoE&t=128.42000000000002s)]
