# New Law Puts Immediate End To Abortion Access In Kentucky
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg)
*  But I want to start us off tonight here at home with a headline that is maybe not a total [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=0.0s)]
*  surprise, but I think it has come sooner than any of us expected. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=5.4s)]
*  Here it is tonight from the Associated Press, quote, abortions stop in Kentucky as groups [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=9.72s)]
*  seek to block new law. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=17.0s)]
*  Just read that one more time. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=18.44s)]
*  Abortions stop in Kentucky. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=20.04s)]
*  At the end of last month, Republicans in Kentucky passed a bill to make it harder for women [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=23.16s)]
*  to get an abortion in that state. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=27.36s)]
*  Obviously, Kentucky had had a law in the books that said you couldn't get an abortion there [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  if your pregnancy was more than 20 weeks along. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=34.08s)]
*  This new law passed last month rolled that back even further, said that you can no longer [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=36.92s)]
*  get an abortion in the state if your pregnancy is 15 weeks along or further. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=40.72s)]
*  So they rolled it back from 20 to 15 weeks. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=45.92s)]
*  And Kentucky Republicans, of course, they're not the first to pass that kind of legislation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  They won't be the last. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=53.16s)]
*  But unlike in most of the other states with with Republican controlled legislatures, Kentucky [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=54.699999999999996s)]
*  has a governor who is a Democrat. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=59.81999999999999s)]
*  And after the Kentucky Republicans passed that 15 week abortion ban through the legislature [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=62.3s)]
*  last month, the state's Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, he vetoed it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  Well, last night, the Republican-led legislature in Kentucky voted to override the governor's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=70.78s)]
*  veto. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=76.82s)]
*  And the practical consequence of that is very important for our country, because that means [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=78.06s)]
*  that that new abortion ban in Kentucky is now in effect. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  There's no grace period. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=87.04s)]
*  There's no sort of planned implementation date in the future for it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=88.68s)]
*  The law takes effect immediately. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=92.28s)]
*  It's operational today, right now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  And it turns out it's much more than just a 15 week ban. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=97.76s)]
*  There's already only two clinics that provide abortions in the whole state of Kentucky. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=103.4s)]
*  They're both located in Louisville. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=106.84s)]
*  Tonight, both of those clinics say that because of the way this law is written, not just because [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=108.68s)]
*  of the 15 week ban, but because of the other restrictions in the bill that are designed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=113.72s)]
*  to make it basically impossible for anybody to legally provide any abortion in the state. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=117.84s)]
*  Both of those clinics, the last two clinics in the state, tell us tonight that there is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=123.6s)]
*  no way for them to comply with this new law, which again went into effect today with the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=127.32s)]
*  veto override. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=133.0s)]
*  And so the last two clinics in Kentucky are announcing that as of now, they have had to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=134.6s)]
*  close their doors. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=139.94s)]
*  They are no longer able to provide abortions because of this new law as of today. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=141.44s)]
*  Which means, if we're talking about landmarks, today is a landmark. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=146.68s)]
*  Because today, for the first time since Roe versus Wade, Supreme Court decision in 1973, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=151.92s)]
*  today the first American state has gone dark to outright block all legal access to abortions [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=159.12s)]
*  in the state. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=166.96s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=167.96s)]
*  Kentucky is the first one. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=168.96s)]
*  It's the first state with no legal access to abortion since Roe versus Wade in 1973. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_9foCGAzPg&t=169.96s)]
