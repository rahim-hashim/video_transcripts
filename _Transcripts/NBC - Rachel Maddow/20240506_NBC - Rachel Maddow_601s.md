# Maddow: Trump, Republican attacks on legal system are actively damaging U.S. rule of law
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE)
*  The rule of law is mortal, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=0.0s)]
*  It can be killed. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=3.04s)]
*  It is wounded when the people involved in the judicial system [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=5.04s)]
*  and the adjudication of alleged crimes [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  are being threatened and harassed and intimidated [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  and pressured out of their jobs for doing that work. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=12.84s)]
*  Today, Justice Juan Marchand in New York said, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=16.18s)]
*  jail is what is coming next [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  if Trump continues to disobey court orders. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=21.38s)]
*  And do you think he's going to continue [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=25.18s)]
*  to disobey these court orders? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=26.48s)]
*  Justice Marchand today said, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=29.88s)]
*  quote, I worry about the people [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=32.12s)]
*  who would have to execute that sanction, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=34.379999999999995s)]
*  the court officers, the correction officers, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=36.22s)]
*  the Secret Service detail, among others. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  I worry about them and about what would go into [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  executing such a sanction. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=43.06s)]
*  Of course, I'm also aware of the broader implications [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=44.46s)]
*  of such a sanction, but at the end of the day, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  I have a job to do. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=49.5s)]
*  Your continued violations of this court's lawful order [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=50.96s)]
*  threaten to interfere with the administration of justice, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=54.04s)]
*  constant attacks which constitute a direct attack [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=56.58s)]
*  on the rule of law. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=59.1s)]
*  I cannot allow that to continue. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=60.0s)]
*  As much as I don't want to impose a jail sanction [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=61.9s)]
*  and I've done everything I can to avoid doing so, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=64.5s)]
*  I want you to understand that I will. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=67.24s)]
*  I will do it if I have to. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  Your direct attack on the rule of law [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=72.42s)]
*  cannot be allowed to continue. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=74.32s)]
*  Just a signal moment in American history today. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=76.32s)]
*  And it's sort of clearer to me on this day, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=80.96s)]
*  at this moment, than it's ever been in my lifetime. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  That the rule of law isn't just a bumper sticker, right? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  It isn't an abstract thing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=93.2s)]
*  It doesn't float in like a miasma [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=94.84s)]
*  and suffuse the atmosphere. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  The rule of law is specific stuff. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=99.08s)]
*  In a day-to-day way, it means, for example, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=101.48s)]
*  that court orders must be obeyed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  And if you don't obey them, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=105.62s)]
*  the court will punish you for that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=106.96s)]
*  It means, for another example, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=108.42s)]
*  that people who are part of the judicial system, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=110.88s)]
*  judges, court personnel, juries, witnesses, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=113.4s)]
*  defense lawyers, prosecutors, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=116.12s)]
*  it means they're also able to do their work [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=118.14s)]
*  without being threatened or intimidated [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  or being harassed or fired [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  by people who are associated with the accused. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=125.22s)]
*  That's law and order, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=127.92s)]
*  That's the rule of law. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=129.52s)]
*  That's a nuts and bolts concrete thing. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=130.56s)]
*  And it is under intense, incredible pressure. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=133.62s)]
*  It is having trouble right now in our country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=136.54s)]
*  Because as the judge in Trump's first criminal trial [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=139.34s)]
*  is trying to stand up for the rule of law today, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=142.78s)]
*  as he said in this warning to Trump, right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=145.5s)]
*  This cross the Rubicon moment in court today [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=148.04s)]
*  where he'd warned Trump he really is making plans [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=150.28s)]
*  to jail him if he keeps violating the court's order. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=152.7s)]
*  While that is happening, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=156.14s)]
*  simultaneously, the Republican controlled Senate [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=159.42s)]
*  in the state of Georgia is moving forward [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  on what appears to be their plans to subpoena the prosecutor [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=164.98s)]
*  who's leading the criminal case against Trump [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=168.48s)]
*  in the state of Georgia. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=170.48s)]
*  District Attorney Fannie Willis is leading that prosecution. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=171.48s)]
*  As soon as she opened that investigation, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=174.96s)]
*  the Republican led legislature in Georgia [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=177.24s)]
*  started moving to try to curtail her authority [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=179.56s)]
*  to give themselves the ability to fire her as a prosecutor. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=182.72s)]
*  That process has been weaving and wending [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=187.10000000000002s)]
*  through legal obstacles for months now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=189.08s)]
*  But now they are planning to haul the prosecutor, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=192.72s)]
*  to haul Fannie Willis into the state Senate [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=196.02s)]
*  and force her to turn over evidence [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  and testify herself under oath [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=200.28s)]
*  while she continues to try to lead that prosecution. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=202.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, simultaneously on Capitol Hill, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=207.48s)]
*  we've now got the Republican chair [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=210.28s)]
*  of the House Judiciary Committee, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=211.76s)]
*  Congressman Jim Jordan, launching apparently [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=212.96s)]
*  some kind of new investigation [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=215.4s)]
*  into one of the assistant district attorneys [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=217.48s)]
*  who was in court today leading the prosecution [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  of Trump in his New York case. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=222.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, simultaneously this weekend, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=225.16s)]
*  the former president hosted a high dollar fundraiser [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=227.72s)]
*  at his home in Florida, in which he unbidden [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=230.34s)]
*  brought up the federal prosecutor [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=234.34s)]
*  who's overseeing his classified documents, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=236.66000000000003s)]
*  Espionage Act prosecution in Florida, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=238.82000000000002s)]
*  and also his overthrow the government case in Washington DC. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  According to a recording of those proceedings [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=245.22s)]
*  reviewed by NBC News, Trump said at this fundraiser, quote, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=247.70000000000002s)]
*  "'Deranged Jack Smith, one of the sickest prosecutors [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=251.38000000000002s)]
*  in the world, the sick, evil thug. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=255.06s)]
*  Take a look at the deranged, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=257.70000000000005s)]
*  and he's perfect because you look at him. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=260.66s)]
*  He's not attractive, both inside and out. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=262.82000000000005s)]
*  I mean, you couldn't get a better guy [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=265.46000000000004s)]
*  if you're trying to make the devil that deranged. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=267.14000000000004s)]
*  Yes, this is one unattractive dude. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=270.06s)]
*  That's why,' and then the former president [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=272.62s)]
*  reportedly said, "'Frickin' expletive.'" [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=275.5s)]
*  So that was Saturday afternoon. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=282.3s)]
*  That was not long after he had posted this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=283.66s)]
*  in all caps online on his social media company, quote, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=285.74s)]
*  "'Arrest deranged Jack Smith. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=289.26s)]
*  He is a criminal.'" [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=292.14s)]
*  Again, the rule of law is not an abstract feeling [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  or sense of being. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  It's not something you just proclaim to be true [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=299.54s)]
*  and then set it and forget it, right? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=301.86s)]
*  Terrorizing judges and juries and witnesses and prosecutors [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=304.62s)]
*  is something that breaks the rule of law. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=308.26s)]
*  If those people are intimidated and harassed and threatened, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=312.18s)]
*  the rule of law has been broken. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=315.22s)]
*  This past Friday, California man was criminally charged [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=319.42s)]
*  with making death threats [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=322.18s)]
*  against Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=323.42s)]
*  A few weeks ago, a man in New York was charged [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=326.22s)]
*  with threatening New York's Attorney General, Tish James, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=328.1s)]
*  and Judge Arthur Ingoran, who was overseeing the civil case [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=331.26000000000005s)]
*  brought against Trump's business [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=334.3s)]
*  by New York Attorney General Tish James. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  In February, a woman from Texas was sentenced [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=337.94000000000005s)]
*  to three years in prison for threatening the judge [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=340.18s)]
*  overseeing Trump's classified documents case [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  in Florida. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=345.02s)]
*  Not long before that, a different Texas woman [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=345.94s)]

*  We are not looking at some vague future threat [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=373.5s)]

*  and currently damaging the rule of law right now, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=381.62s)]
*  because people are intimidated and terrorized. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  People who work in the legal system [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=387.34s)]

*  And it is happening in all the criminal cases [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=399.41999999999996s)]
*  that surround Trump. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=401.7s)]
*  You might remember this lead in a recent special report [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=404.38s)]
*  from Reuters, quote, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=407.38s)]
*  District Judge Royce Lamberth has been threatened [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=408.46000000000004s)]
*  with angry, threatened by angry criminals, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=411.18s)]
*  drug cartels, even Al Qaeda. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=413.98s)]
*  But nothing, Lamberth says, prepared him [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=416.90000000000003s)]
*  for the wave of harassment after he began hearing cases [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=418.82s)]
*  against supporters of former President Donald Trump, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=421.82s)]
*  who attacked the US Capitol, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=423.94s)]
*  in a bid to overturn the 2020 election. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=425.38s)]
*  Lamberth, who was appointed to the bench [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=427.62s)]
*  by Republican President Ronald Reagan, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=429.1s)]

*  as part of a deep state conspiracy [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=432.94s)]
*  to destroy Trump and his followers. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=434.85999999999996s)]
*  Calls for his execution cropped up on pro-Trump websites, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=436.78s)]
*  quote, traitors get ropes, said one. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=440.17999999999995s)]
*  After he issued a prison sentence to one Idaho woman [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=443.97999999999996s)]
*  who pled guilty to joining the January 6th riot, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=446.5s)]
*  Lamberth's chambers voicemail filled with death threats. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=449.17999999999995s)]
*  One man found Lamberth's home phone number [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=454.46s)]
*  and called repeatedly with graphic vows to murder him. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=456.78s)]
*  Lamberth told Reuters, quote, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=461.14s)]
*  I could not believe how many death threats I got. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=462.62s)]
*  This is, again, not some future potential threat [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=468.94s)]
*  to the rule of law. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=472.74s)]
*  This is damage to the rule of law, and it is here already. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=473.82s)]
*  When participating in the adjudication of alleged crimes [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=478.3s)]
*  by a political figure and his followers [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=481.74s)]
*  bring you death threats, the rule of law has been bent. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=483.94s)]
*  The rule of law has been broken. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=489.06s)]
*  Those harms to the rule of law, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=493.62s)]
*  that damage to the rule of law has been inflicted already. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=496.58s)]
*  The prospect of jail for the Republican Party's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=501.34000000000003s)]
*  active presidential nominee, that is here already. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=503.9s)]
*  He got his face-to-face warning in court today in New York. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=506.86s)]
*  One more violation of the court's order, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=509.86s)]
*  banning him from speaking about the jury or witnesses [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=511.66s)]
*  in his case, and he will be put in jail [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=514.02s)]
*  with Secret Service detail. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=516.22s)]
*  That time is now here, which means we are about to find out [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=518.62s)]
*  what it's like to be a country that has a presidential [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=523.38s)]
*  candidate and former president in jail [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=525.86s)]
*  because he refuses to follow court orders. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=528.5s)]
*  It's not a thought experiment anymore. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=530.46s)]
*  It's not the future. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=532.26s)]
*  It is here. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=533.14s)]
*  Are we ready? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=533.98s)]
*  And so what do we do about that? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=537.18s)]
*  One way to start dealing with that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=540.9s)]
*  is to stop pretending that it's not happening. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=542.78s)]
*  Threats to the rule of law are not a theoretical prospect [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=545.38s)]
*  looming sometime in the future. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=548.22s)]
*  They are here. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=549.82s)]
*  Prosecutors and judges and jurors and witnesses [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=550.9s)]
*  need defending right now, right now, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=554.78s)]
*  because they're being threatened right now. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=558.9s)]
*  Who, for example, who is defending Fannie Willis [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=561.42s)]
*  in Georgia right now? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=564.22s)]
*  The Republican-led legislature in Georgia [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=567.54s)]
*  is trying to destroy her and remove her in order [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=569.8199999999999s)]
*  to stop her from prosecuting the alleged crimes of former [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=573.54s)]
*  President Donald Trump. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=577.54s)]
*  Who is defending her? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4RFFSFrGxE&t=579.34s)]
