# 'There is no way to both-sides this': Republican meltdown paints stark contrast with Democrats
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY)
*  As much as I have found it frustrating for years, there is still, even now, unbelievably, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=0.0s)]
*  a lot of lazy punditry, a lot of lazy assuming out there in the press that our two major [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=6.76s)]
*  parties in this country are basically the same, that there are mirror images of each [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=16.28s)]
*  other. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=19.8s)]
*  The actual news from the actual world is here to disprove that most days, particularly today, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=21.92s)]
*  though. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=28.72s)]
*  And today, you know, Congress just narrowly averted a government shutdown this weekend, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=29.72s)]
*  right? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=36.08s)]
*  Today, Congress was consumed with drama over whether the farthest right faction in the Republican [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=37.08s)]
*  Party will be successful in their efforts to oust the Republican Speaker of the House. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=42.6s)]
*  Why do they want to oust him as Speaker of the House? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=48.5s)]
*  Because he had the temerity to work with Democrats on a bill that kept the government from shutting [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=51.32s)]
*  down. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=57.0s)]
*  That is kind of their sum total of their argument against him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=58.28s)]
*  I mean, for them, it is self-evident that that grave crime is enough. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=62.28s)]
*  If House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is going to commit the mortal sin of working with the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=67.04s)]
*  Democrats on anything, then obviously he must lose his job. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=70.56s)]
*  He can no longer be a Republican Speaker of the House. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=74.36s)]
*  And that is, I mean, that's what today was consumed with in Congress. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=78.4s)]
*  That is now what Congress is going to be about for at least the rest of this week and maybe [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=81.5s)]
*  longer. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=85.76s)]
*  Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz tonight actually filed his motion to vacate, which [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  means within two legislative days, members of the House will have to take up the future [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=92.64s)]
*  of McCarthy's speakership, thanks to Gaetz's objection that McCarthy had the temerity to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=97.58000000000001s)]
*  work with Democrats. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  And nobody knows exactly whether this is going to work, whether Democrats are going to help [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=106.12s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy stay in power. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=112.44s)]
*  What they might demand is their price if they choose to do that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=114.42s)]
*  We also don't know how Republicans will line up for and against Kevin McCarthy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=118.34s)]
*  Fox News is now reporting that some Republicans who like Kevin McCarthy might try to end run [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  this whole thing by trying to expel Matt Gaetz from Congress altogether. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=127.42s)]
*  That should make for some happy, happy fun times. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=131.7s)]
*  But bottom line, whether or not Republicans succeed in ousting their own Speaker of the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=134.0s)]
*  House over this narrow miss on a government shutdown, whether or not it ultimately ousts [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=140.14s)]
*  him from the speakership, the message here is clear, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=146.94s)]
*  I mean, in the Republican Party, if you work with Democrats on anything, you are in big [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=152.61999999999998s)]
*  trouble as a Republican. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=158.5s)]
*  That is where the Republican Party is at right now. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=161.7s)]
*  Meanwhile, here's how the Democratic president is campaigning for reelection. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=166.38s)]
*  There was a time in America when we expected leaders to put people over politics, when [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=174.1s)]
*  instead of shouting, people from different parties talked and listened. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=180.14s)]
*  But for Joe Biden, compromise is in the way of the past. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=185.45999999999998s)]
*  It's how he's building America's future, passing hundreds of bipartisan laws, a law [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=189.1s)]
*  to rebuild our roads and bridges that puts Americans to work, to make America a leader [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=195.02s)]
*  in high tech manufacturing, bringing good jobs home, laws to improve veterans health [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=200.3s)]
*  care and strengthen gun safety. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=205.86s)]
*  Every one of those laws bipartisan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=208.5s)]
*  He hasn't gotten everything he wants, but that's not how he measures success. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=211.58s)]
*  For Joe Biden, success means lifting everyone in America, no matter where you live or who [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=216.5s)]
*  you voted for, because he is a president for all Americans. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=222.58s)]
*  I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=227.54s)]
*  He hasn't gotten everything he wanted, but that's not how he defines success. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=232.7s)]
*  Now, for for for true blue liberals and and real Democratic partisans who are watching [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=238.1s)]
*  that ad, you may object to that strategy, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=243.02s)]
*  And some of that imagery in particular can be hard to swallow. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=245.9s)]
*  You know, Condoleezza Rice and Reagan and even John McCain, right? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  But that's Joe Biden, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=253.82s)]
*  President Biden has always been a very collegial guy, both with his Democratic colleagues [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=255.1s)]
*  and also with Republicans. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  It is a core part of how he works as a politician and therefore of what people expect [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=261.94s)]
*  from him in politics. Yes, he is a liberal. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=267.46s)]
*  Yes, he is a progressive on almost all policy issues, but he will work with everyone. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=269.9s)]
*  He'll always try to find middle ground. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=274.86s)]
*  That's Joe Biden. He has been doing this literally for decades. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=276.38s)]
*  It is not a surprise that this is how he works. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=279.74s)]
*  And this is now how he is campaigning for reelection. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=282.74s)]
*  Democrats are campaigning for office by saying, I'll compromise and find middle ground. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=286.14000000000004s)]
*  Republicans are run out of their party for even thinking about that, let alone doing it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=290.26s)]
*  There there is no way to both sides this. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=297.42s)]
*  There is no mirror image here. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=300.98s)]
*  One of these things is not like the other. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=303.18s)]
*  The two parties are working on two different projects. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=305.42s)]
*  And the reasons for that are myriad. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=310.42s)]
*  But here's another piece of it that we are just learning. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=313.94s)]
*  NBC News has just broken a new story tonight, a very provocative story within the last hour [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=319.18s)]
*  that may give us a little bit of a window into why the two sides, the two major political parties [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=324.86s)]
*  in the United States right now, seem like they are coming from two different planets [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=330.54s)]
*  and they are trying to do two totally different things. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=334.62s)]
*  It may have a little bit to do with the relationship between the fringe, the extreme, and the middle. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=337.7s)]
*  The distance between the, you know, not just not governing, but really far out there, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=346.9s)]
*  sort of non-respectable fringe and the actual governing part of the party. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=355.26s)]
*  Here's a story. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  About 25 years ago, 1997, the flagship conservative magazine, The National Review, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=362.86s)]
*  went through one of its periodic purges. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=368.66s)]
*  They realized, as they periodically do, that they were employing some writers, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=372.02000000000004s)]
*  they were publishing some pieces that were just too racist. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=376.90000000000003s)]
*  They have periodically realized this over the course of the history of this magazine. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=381.22s)]
*  They have to do this when they have ended up publishing people who claimed that, you know, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=384.78000000000003s)]
*  white people are naturally more intelligent than everybody else, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=389.46s)]
*  that white people are genetically superior to all other races. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  They were publishing a guy who argued that white parents and Asian parents [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  should teach their children to avoid black people. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=399.7s)]
*  They published a guy who argued that America was in the midst of a genocide of white people [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=402.41999999999996s)]
*  because of non-white immigrants coming into America. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=406.9s)]
*  The National Review periodically has had to do these kinds of purges, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=409.62s)]
*  but the one they did in 1997 resulted in a new home being founded, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=412.82s)]
*  effectively, for people like that who The National Review has to fire. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=419.78s)]
*  In 1999, an organization was set up called V-Dare, and V-Dare, they say, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=424.26s)]
*  stands for the name Virginia Dare, who they say was supposedly the first white child [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=431.38s)]
*  born in colonial America. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=438.26s)]
*  You can see where this is going, right? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=440.82s)]
*  The founder of V-Dare, one of these guys who got fired from The National Review [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=442.98s)]
*  for his whites-only immigration stuff, he founded V-Dare, basically set it up as an online hub [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=446.65999999999997s)]
*  for people to advance academic-sounding and political-sounding racism. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=451.94s)]
*  And I don't mean that in a vague kind of way. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=456.26s)]
*  I mean it really specifically. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=458.26s)]
*  The founder of V-Dare calls himself a racial nationalist. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=459.62s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=463.86s)]
*  It means in this nation, it should just be the one race. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=464.65999999999997s)]
*  He said the Obama administration was a minority occupation government, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=468.65999999999997s)]
*  meaning it was not an American government, but it was a minority occupation by some foreign entity. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=473.7s)]
*  He also says, and forgive me for even quoting this, but he says that Hispanics, quote, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=480.82s)]
*  specialize in rape. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=486.26s)]
*  He says the United States, quote, is a white nation. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=489.61999999999995s)]
*  So this is stuff that's like off the edge, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=495.05999999999995s)]
*  Or at least, at least it used to be. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=497.3s)]
*  In 2018, CNN reported that a speechwriter in the Trump White House had spoken at a white [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=499.86s)]
*  nationalist conference and done a panel with the founder of V-Dare just a few days before [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=508.98s)]
*  election day in 2016. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=515.7s)]
*  And when that news came out in CNN, that speechwriter was fired from the Trump White House. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=518.1s)]
*  But these guys have to land somewhere, right? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=523.62s)]
*  It turns out that guy who went straight from appearing with the V-Dare guy at the white [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=525.46s)]
*  nationalist event the week of the 2016 election, he went, you know, straight from there to a job [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=531.62s)]
*  working in the Trump White House as a speechwriter thereafter. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=536.82s)]
*  When he was fired from even the Trump White House, he first briefly landed a new speechwriter job [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=539.86s)]
*  with Congressman Matt Gaetz, who just tonight has filed this motion to vacate to remove [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=546.82s)]
*  Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy from his job for the capital crime of working [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=553.3s)]
*  with Democrats to keep the government open. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=558.8199999999999s)]
*  So this guy fired from the Trump White House briefly lands as a speechwriter with Matt Gaetz. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=562.02s)]
*  Then he lands at a website, a right-wing website that, among other things, pushes the conspiracy [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=567.54s)]
*  theory that there wasn't really an attack on the U.S. Capitol by a Trump-supporting mob on January [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TASsqrRLhMY&t=573.4599999999999s)]
