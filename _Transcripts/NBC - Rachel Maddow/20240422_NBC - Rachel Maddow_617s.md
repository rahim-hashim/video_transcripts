# 'He wrote all of it down??': Prosecutors claim to have handwritten notes of Trump hush money scheme
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc)
*  I was at the courthouse today in Manhattan. I was in the courtroom for opening statements for this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=0.0s)]
*  first criminal trial of the former president. I can report firsthand that the courtroom smells [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=5.76s)]
*  like old soup and stale breath. I can report that the police officers who police the courtroom are [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  working very hard and they appear to be very stressed. I can report that Judge Murchon is [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=18.0s)]
*  soft-spoken and has what I think would be universally considered to be a pleasant voice. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=23.84s)]
*  I can report that prosecutor Matthew Colangelo speaks exactly like Seth Meyers speaks when Seth [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=29.52s)]
*  Meyers is not telling jokes. I can tell you that the first witness, David Pecker, accidentally gave [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=36.0s)]
*  out his whole phone number today when the prosecutor just asked him to confirm the last four digits. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=42.16s)]
*  He was trying to remember the last four digits and in order to get there in his head, he said the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=47.04s)]
*  whole number out loud and oops didn't mean to do that. I can report that former president Donald [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=51.04s)]
*  Trump looks a lot older than he used to and that it seemed to me in my subjective take that he [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=56.24s)]
*  seemed miserable to be there. But you know, I look a lot older than I used to look as well [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=65.6s)]
*  and I think anybody's got a right to look miserable when they're sitting in a courtroom [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=71.36s)]
*  charged with dozens of felonies as a criminal defendant. The courtroom is bare bones. It is [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=74.88s)]
*  not large. It is inelegant. It has unflattering lighting. Like I said, it does not smell good [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=81.6s)]
*  and everybody is very tense. What I mean to present to you with all of this information [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=88.8s)]
*  is that given the choice, nobody would want to be there except of course journalists and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=95.44s)]
*  reporters covering the most historic trial in American political history. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=100.96s)]
*  To that end, I'd also like to say that I am sorry to the journalists who are sitting immediately next to me [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=104.4s)]
*  because I unintentionally snorted out loud and went, oh, when this happened today at the trial [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  and when I read this part of the transcript to you, you will know why I said, oh, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=119.12s)]
*  prosecutor Matthew Colangelo, in January 2017, before the defendant moved down to Washington [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  to begin his presidency, Michael Cohen met with Allen Weisselberg of the Trump Organization [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=129.36s)]
*  to talk about how Cohen was going to get reimbursed for the payoff to Stormy Daniels. Weisselberg, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  you will remember, was the Trump Organization chief financial officer and he was one of the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  defendant's longest serving and most trusted employees. Neither Trump nor the Trump Organization [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=144.08s)]
*  could just write a check to Michael Cohen for $130,000 with a memo line that said, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  reimbursement for porn star payoff. They had to disguise the nature of the repayment, so they [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  agreed to cook the books and make it look like the repayment was actually income, payments for [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=160.88s)]
*  services rendered instead of a reimbursement. Allen Weisselberg asked Mr. Cohen to bring a copy [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=167.04s)]
*  of a bank statement showing the $130,000 payment that Cohen had made to keep Stormy Daniels quiet [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=172.88s)]
*  before the election. Weisselberg and Cohen agreed to a total repayment amount of $420,000. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  Here is how they got to that number. This is good. They started with the $130,000 that Trump owed [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=183.6s)]
*  Cohen for the Stormy Daniels payoff. Then they added $50,000 for a separate reimbursement Cohen [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=192.24s)]
*  was claiming, which had to do with tech services he paid for during the campaign. That adds up to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=199.04s)]
*  $180,000. Then they agreed to double that amount to $360,000 to account for taxes. Now, of course, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=204.8s)]
*  if Trump was just reimbursing Cohen, there was no need to gross it up for taxes. They doubled it [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=212.88s)]
*  because their plan was to call it income instead of a reimbursement. If Cohen was getting money, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=218.32s)]
*  they were calling income. He would have to pay taxes on it. Cohen was close to a 50% tax bracket, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=223.2s)]
*  so to make him whole on the $180,000 that the defendant owed him, they had to double the amount [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=228.64s)]
*  to $360,000. Then he had added another $60,000 as a year-end bonus. And all of that comes out to a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=234.24s)]
*  total of $420,000. And Allen Weisselberg wrote all of that down. Whereupon I annoyed the people [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=242.24s)]
*  sitting near me because I snorted out loud and said, ooh, he wrote it all down. If you were a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  fan of a wire, this is the scene where Stringer Bell turns to the young man and says, are you [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  taking notes on a criminal conspiracy? Using a lot of swear words. Yes, yes, he was taking notes on [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=262.24s)]
*  a criminal conspiracy. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo. Allen Weisselberg wrote all of that down. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=269.12s)]
*  You can't believe this is real. The bank statement that I told you about that he asked Cohen to bring [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=280.48s)]
*  to their meeting, the bank statement from the Essential Consultants account, which showed the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=285.12s)]
*  $130,000 wire that Cohen had made to Keith Davidson to keep Stormy Daniels quiet, you will see in this [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=289.2s)]
*  trial Allen Weisselberg's handwriting down the side of that bank statement, laying out every one [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=295.36s)]
*  of the steps that I just described, showing how they converted the $130,000 payoff amount to the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=301.44s)]
*  $420,000 that Cohen was going to get paid back as a grossed-up way to disguise it, not as reimbursement, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=306.8s)]
*  but as income. And they took notes about it every step of the way, and the prosecution has the notes. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  And then here's the kicker. Matthew Colangelo, prosecutor, quote, Cohen and Weisselberg then [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=319.12s)]
*  met with Trump, who approved the repayment amount of $420,000 on the $130,000 Stormy Daniels payment [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=324.16s)]
*  and a few other expenses. Now you will see evidence at trial that Trump was a very frugal businessman. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  He believed in pinching pennies. He believed in watching every dollar. He believed in negotiating [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  every bill. It's all over all of the books he has written. He ran the Trump Organization with total [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=341.36s)]
*  control. You will hear testimony about his relentless focus on the bottom line. But when [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=345.68s)]
*  it came time to pay Michael Cohen back for the catch-and-kill deal, you will see that he didn't [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=349.84s)]
*  negotiate the price down. He doubled it. And he doubled it so they could disguise it as income. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  And you will hear evidence that the Trump Organization was not in the practice of paying [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=359.67999999999995s)]
*  people twice what they owed for anything. This might be the only time that ever happened. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=363.67999999999995s)]
*  And Trump's willingness to do so here shows just how important it was to him to hide the true nature [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=368.88s)]
*  of Cohen's illegal payment to Ms. Daniels and the overall election conspiracy that they had [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=374.32s)]
*  launched in August 2015. Prosecutors saying Trump is paying a lot for this and he never pays for [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=379.52s)]
*  anything. That's how important and sensitive this was. Now interestingly, moments later, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=386.88s)]
*  the defense used this same set of facts to make the opposite point to the jury, saying, yeah, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=393.6s)]
*  Trump really is so cheap and so unwilling to pay for anything. So this must have been some other [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=398.72s)]
*  thing he was paying for, not the thing they have handwritten notes from his CFO about. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=405.6s)]
*  Joining us now is former FBI General Counsel Andrew Weissman. Also with us, former Assistant [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=412.56s)]
*  District Attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, Catherine Christian. Catherine [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=416.88000000000005s)]
*  and Andrew, thank you both for being here. Andrew, let me ask you first, was Stringer Bell right to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  ask Allen Wesselberg, are you taking notes on a criminal conspiracy? Is this document potentially [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=426.48s)]
*  important here? So you must have seen my notes because that is starred, that was the page where [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  I had the same reaction. So one of the things that you listen for when you listen to openings on both [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  sides is you know that there are witnesses who are going to testify and you think about how they're [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=446.32s)]
*  going to do, whether they have memory issues, whether they have credibility issues, but then [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=451.12s)]
*  you look for what is the prosecution going to say with respect to what's so-called hard evidence. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=454.88s)]
*  And there, the things that stood out to me was you had a reference to the tape recording that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=460.96s)]
*  we've heard about, that's where Donald Trump is overheard saying, hey, let's just pay the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=465.92s)]
*  $130,000 in cash. That's a terrible tape for Donald Trump. Second, there was references to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  telephone records at a critical time that the payments were first made by Michael Cohen [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=477.68s)]
*  to Stormy Daniels, where there are two calls that the prosecutor referenced between Michael Cohen [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=484.56s)]
*  and Donald Trump. And then the third was this, which is definitely a fall off your chair moment [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=492.16s)]
*  where they have it in writing. And what's so interesting is that the defense said the repayment [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=498.16s)]
*  was not, it was not reimbursement for the payments to Stormy Daniels. I do not know [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=506.0s)]
*  how they're going to deal with that when you have these notes. And remember, when you make a promise, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=513.28s)]
*  when you say something at openings, as Catherine knows, as Katie knows, that comes back to haunt [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=518.88s)]
*  you. If you have over-promised, if you've made a misstatement, both sides are listening for that [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=524.88s)]
*  because they're going to bring it up again in closing. Catherine, is it important here that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=531.12s)]
*  we don't expect Alan Weisselberg himself to be a witness, to potentially walk the jury through [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=536.08s)]
*  what his notes meant and explain this document that is otherwise sort of a fall off your chair [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=542.16s)]
*  moment, like Andrew said? Well, it's a good thing since he's serving time for perjury. So neither [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=548.4s)]
*  side wants him as a witness. So it's very good for the prosecution because they can just have the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=554.24s)]
*  notes. And obviously Donald Trump doesn't want a perjurer testifying on his behalf. So that's a [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=560.24s)]
*  good thing. But I agree with Andrew. This is the corroboration. When you talk about Michael Cohen [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=565.8399999999999s)]
*  in his baggage, this is where you have corroboration of his statement. So there's no way the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=571.6s)]
*  Manhattan DA's office would have just relied on Michael Cohen's testimony if they did not have [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=578.24s)]
*  corroborating documents, corroborating witnesses. Hey everyone, MSNBC has a new and improved app. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPAcsRjJysc&t=583.2s)]
