# 'Like a moral tug of war for the soul': Horrific knife attack sets up modern political showdown
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA)
*  He's 17 and he is from France. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=0.0s)]
*  He's not Irish. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=2.84s)]
*  He's come over from France to go to Ireland, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=4.16s)]
*  work at this restaurant. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  He has like an intern job in the kitchen. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  And this past week on Thursday, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=12.48s)]
*  on our Thanksgiving day here, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=14.96s)]
*  this young man, 17 years old, he was on his way to work. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=17.16s)]
*  It was about 1.30 in the afternoon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=20.32s)]
*  And he happened upon a man with a knife [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=22.32s)]
*  who was in the middle of attacking someone. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=27.44s)]
*  And the kid jumped into the fray. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  He was armed with absolutely nothing at all. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=32.28s)]
*  The kid struggled with this armed man. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=36.28s)]
*  He actually got cut on his hands and his face [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=38.68s)]
*  in the struggle, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=42.32s)]
*  but the kid managed to get the knife out of this guy's hands. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=43.44s)]
*  The restaurant that the kid works at, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  again, Spittlefields in Dublin, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=51.68s)]
*  they posted this photo of him online [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=52.96s)]
*  and a testimony to how proud they are of him [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  and what he did. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  They said, not all superheroes wear capes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=58.28s)]
*  The Irish Times also reports that the president of France, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=62.2s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron, placed a call to this young man, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=65.72s)]
*  thanking him personally on behalf of his country, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=68.92s)]
*  thanking him on behalf of France for what he did [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=71.48s)]
*  in rushing in to stop that attack [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=75.6s)]
*  while he was on his way to work in Dublin in Ireland. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=79.16s)]
*  This man is also not from there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=85.12s)]
*  He is from Brazil. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  He's from Rio de Janeiro. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=88.64s)]
*  He's been in Ireland for only about a year. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=90.04s)]
*  He moved to Ireland for work. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=92.16s)]
*  And again, on our Thanksgiving day, on Thursday, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=94.48s)]
*  he was also at work in Dublin. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=98.92s)]
*  He was driving a scooter for a food delivery company, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  a company called Deliveroo. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  And on his Deliveroo scooter, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=106.64s)]
*  he passed what he thought at first was a fight. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=108.92s)]
*  He slowed down because he thought it was a fight in progress. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=111.84s)]
*  It turned out not to be a fight. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=114.92s)]
*  It was that same man, the man with the knife, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=116.6s)]
*  in the middle of what appears to have been [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=119.08s)]
*  a totally unprovoked knife attack. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=120.96s)]
*  The Brazilian delivery driver was apparently [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=124.16s)]
*  the first passerby to realize what was happening [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=127.28s)]
*  on the sidewalk that day. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=130.64s)]
*  He stopped his, he pulled over, stopped his scooter. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=132.32s)]
*  He ran over to the man with the knife. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=136.4s)]
*  He took off the motorcycle helmet that he was wearing, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=138.2s)]
*  and he used his motorcycle helmet to hit the guy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=141.6s)]
*  He clocked the guy in the head with the motorcycle helmet, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=145.48s)]
*  which knocked the guy down. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=149.2s)]
*  And then once the guy was down on the ground, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  he hit him once more with the helmet. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=151.92s)]
*  Once the man with the knife was down on the ground, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=153.56s)]
*  thanks to the delivery driver [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=156.6s)]
*  taking off his motorcycle helmet [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  and using it to hit the guy and knock him down, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  that's apparently when other people, other passersby, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=161.88s)]
*  were able to get to the guy as well to hold him down, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=164.72s)]
*  frankly, to hit him some more. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=167.32s)]
*  But that is also when the 17-year-old, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=168.92s)]
*  the French kid from the restaurant, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=171.2s)]
*  was able to get the knife out of the guy's hand, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=173.6s)]
*  himself getting cut in the process. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  But it was passersby who stopped it, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  the kid from the restaurant [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=181.84s)]
*  and the delivery driver on the scooter playing crucial roles. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=183.16s)]
*  The delivery driver gave a statement to police [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=186.28s)]
*  after the police arrived on the scene. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=189.32s)]
*  He also gave a statement to a local news organization, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=190.84s)]
*  RTE, about what happened. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=193.0s)]
*  And then another local guy, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=196.6s)]
*  another local guy from Dublin, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=199.4s)]
*  decided to start a GoFundMe, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=200.92s)]
*  asking people to show their appreciation [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=204.2s)]
*  by buying the guy a proverbial pint. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=206.88s)]
*  The GoFundMe said, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=210.0s)]
*  the man's a hero and the least we can do is buy him a pint. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=210.84s)]
*  So I'm asking you to donate the price [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=214.88s)]
*  of a pint of Guinness in your local [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=216.64s)]
*  so he knows the people of Dublin appreciate him. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=218.48s)]
*  So again, the attack was Thanksgiving Day, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=222.68s)]
*  it was on Thursday. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=224.44s)]
*  The GoFundMe for the delivery driver [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=225.8s)]
*  was posted on Friday. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=227.84s)]
*  By Saturday, it had raised more than 300,000 euros. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=230.12s)]
*  This is the headline in the New York Times. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=235.36s)]
*  Donors give over 300,000 euros for immigrant [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=236.56s)]
*  who intervened in Dublin's stabbing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  Many people in Ireland and beyond are saying thanks [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=242.44s)]
*  by buying him a proverbial pint. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=245.28s)]
*  As of tonight, I just checked before we got on the air, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=248.0s)]
*  more than 33,000 people have made donations [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=249.88s)]
*  to that GoFundMe to say thank you [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=255.16s)]
*  to the delivery driver on the scooter. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=257.44s)]
*  Now, the knife attack that these two men, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=261.32s)]
*  the Brazilian guy and the French guy, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=265.12s)]
*  the knife attack that they intervened in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=267.76s)]
*  in Dublin on Thursday, it was a terrible attack. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=270.64s)]
*  Three little kids were hurt, one of them quite seriously, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=273.8s)]
*  also a childcare worker who stepped in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=276.68s)]
*  to try to protect the little kids. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=279.04s)]
*  The man who stabbed these people, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=281.28s)]
*  nobody knows why he did it, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=283.72s)]
*  but he was stopped by these passersby on the street [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=285.08s)]
*  before the police were able to get there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=288.2s)]
*  Once the police got there, he was arrested. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  Almost immediately after this attack, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=293.08s)]
*  right-wing social media outlets, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=294.68s)]
*  including Twitter here in the United States [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  and right-wing political groups locally, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=299.76s)]
*  they started spreading speculation [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=303.48s)]
*  about who the attacker was and why he did it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=305.72s)]
*  They called for people to come out [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  and riot against immigrants in Dublin. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=310.52s)]
*  And people did, and they burned a bus, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=315.2s)]
*  they smashed up cars, including police cars, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  they looted stores, they attacked hostels and hotels [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=320.08s)]
*  where people thought that immigrants were staying. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  But again, it was a Brazilian immigrant delivery driver [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  who clocked the guy in the head with his helmet [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=330.88s)]
*  and stopped the attack. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=333.24s)]
*  It was this young kid from France [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=334.44s)]
*  who got the knife off the guy once and for all. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=336.76s)]
*  So you get, you are here, right? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=341.52s)]
*  I mean, you get the terrible attack, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=344.52s)]
*  senseless, horrific attack. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=347.52s)]
*  You also get hero immigrants stopping it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=350.2s)]
*  You also get anti-immigrant riots. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0e0k2j9UuA&t=352.96s)]
