# New Reporting Shows Shameless Self-Dealing By Trump Admin's Jared Kushner, Steve Mnuchin
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o)
*  Here's a little quiz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=0.0s)]
*  Can you identify these three gentlemen? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=3.52s)]
*  If your idea of a fun party is identifying recent, lesser-known government officials, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=5.2s)]
*  then this is a fun party, right? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=9.32s)]
*  You got it? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=10.64s)]
*  Know who these guys are? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=11.64s)]
*  Yes, they are all former U.S. Treasury secretaries. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=12.64s)]
*  One Treasury secretary from the George W. Bush years and the other two are from the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=16.72s)]
*  Obama years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=19.76s)]
*  If you got that, congratulations. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=21.6s)]
*  You're going to kill it at your next pub quiz trivia night, right? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=22.6s)]
*  Of course, one of the things that Treasury secretaries do is they have to travel around [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=27.64s)]
*  the world to discuss financial stuff. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=30.8s)]
*  Occasionally, for example, they have to travel to the Middle East, to the Persian Gulf countries, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=32.6s)]
*  to talk oil prices or to encourage investment in the United States or whatever. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  These are all photos of those three Treasury secretaries visiting the Persian Gulf states. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=42.4s)]
*  But there aren't all that many photos of them because there weren't all that many [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=47.16s)]
*  of those trips. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=49.96s)]
*  Those three guys, over the space of a decade, over two different administrations, all three [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=50.96s)]
*  of them together visited the Persian Gulf states eight times, eight times in total between [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=55.12s)]
*  all of them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  Now, how about this guy? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  You recognize him? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=64.08s)]
*  A little more recent. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=65.08s)]
*  Guy who held the same job, Donald Trump's Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=67.32s)]
*  During Trump's one term, during the four years he was Treasury secretary, you know [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=71.08s)]
*  how many times he went to the Gulf states? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=74.96s)]
*  At least 18. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  The last three guys went eight times in total between them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=80.84s)]
*  Mnuchin went 18 times just himself. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  That's a 12-hour transatlantic flight to visit his friends in the Gulf, probably more [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  often than you visited your friends who live across town. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, his three predecessors, eight times combined over a decade. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  Mnuchin, 18 times in four years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=99.44s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, new reporting from the New York Times suggests one answer to that question. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin was visiting Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=107.8s)]
*  Qatar and Kuwait to scare up new investments. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  For himself, not for the United States, which is a thing that's called self-dealing, and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  it's a thing that we're not supposed to do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=121.0s)]
*  Last month, the New York Times reported on truly remarkable sums of cash that the various [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=123.92s)]
*  Gulf monarchies had invested in private projects being run by Steven Mnuchin, as well as projects [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=128.48s)]
*  for Trump's son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=135.48s)]
*  And the monarchies started paying out these funds almost as soon as those guys left the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=138.39999999999998s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  Last year, after Trump was out of office, the Saudis gave Steven Mnuchin a billion dollars [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=144.1s)]
*  for his new investment fund. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=148.73999999999998s)]
*  They gave Jared Kushner two billion dollars. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  And they did this even though Saudi Arabia's own investment advisers explicitly recommended [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=154.32s)]
*  against it in writing, because they determined that Kushner had no experience, he had no [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=159.0s)]
*  other investors. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=163.9s)]
*  Their due diligence on Kushner's operation showed that they are, quote, unsatisfactory [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=165.1s)]
*  in all aspects. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  But still, the Saudis gave two billion dollars to Jared. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=177.18s)]
*  Well, his father-in-law's administration had bent over backwards for four years to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=178.74s)]
*  try to protect Saudi interests, starting with making Saudi Arabia Trump's very first foreign [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=183.46s)]
*  trip as president, something no president had ever done and no other president ever will. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=188.12s)]
*  Donald Trump and Kushner and Steven Mnuchin defended the Saudis' autocratic de facto ruler [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=193.98s)]
*  after he rounded up and imprisoned hundreds of royal family members, after he started [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=199.78s)]
*  a blockade of the U.S. ally in Qatar, after he signed off on an operation to kidnap and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=204.0s)]
*  ultimately murder and dismember a Washington Post journalist. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=209.06s)]
*  All that favor and protection over the course of four years has got to be worth something, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=218.26s)]
*  A couple billion dollars at least, especially if Donald Trump might be president again one [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=219.26s)]
*  day. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=223.14s)]
*  So there's this sort of implicit quid pro quo in that situation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=224.94s)]
*  Hey, remember how good you were when you were in office? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=228.06s)]
*  Well, how about remember how good our administration was to you when I was in office? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=231.62s)]
*  Well, now how about you put some money in my pocket? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=236.06s)]
*  How about you invest in my new project? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  That quid pro quo with Kushner in particular is icky enough, but this new reporting from [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=240.76s)]
*  the Times suggests that Kushner and Mnuchin may have actively been using their government [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=245.78s)]
*  positions to tee up these money making enterprises for themselves once they left office. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=249.96s)]
*  Right before the 2020 election, Kushner and Mnuchin unveiled a new U.S. government backed [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=254.5s)]
*  investment fund that would extensively raise billions of dollars for projects in the Middle [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  East. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=264.52s)]
*  All through the end of the Trump presidency, Kushner and Mnuchin kept flying all over the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=265.68s)]
*  Middle East on the taxpayers dime, trying to raise money for the supposed government [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=269.36s)]
*  fund. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=273.44s)]
*  Jared made three trips to the Middle East just in the weeks between the election and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=274.44s)]
*  the inauguration of Joe Biden. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=279.0s)]
*  And when the January 6th attack happened, he was on his way back from Saudi Arabia and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=280.76s)]
*  Stephen Mnuchin was on his way to Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=284.84s)]
*  Mnuchin ultimately cut his trip short because of the capital attack, but he did stretch [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=288.48s)]
*  it out still just a couple more days to try to squeeze in one more meeting with the leader [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=292.2s)]
*  of Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=296.0s)]
*  Here's the thing, though. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=298.64s)]
*  All those meetings were supposedly about this U.S. government backed investment fund. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=299.72s)]
*  The Times describes it as, quote, little more than talk with no accounts, no employees, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=304.58s)]
*  no income and no projects. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=309.02s)]
*  The fund vanished when Mr. Trump left office. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=310.38s)]
*  Except Kushner and Mnuchin did later raise billions from all those countries they were [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=314.62s)]
*  scrambling to visit in their last months in government. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=319.5s)]
*  They just didn't raise it for any U.S. government fund, which appears to have never really existed. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=321.86s)]
*  They raised it for themselves. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=327.06s)]
*  Just three weeks after leaving office, Mnuchin was talking about a plan he had. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  A few weeks later, he had detailed investment plans on a half billion dollars from the Amirates, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=333.78000000000003s)]
*  the Kuwaitis and the Qataris. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=338.66s)]
*  A half billion dollars from each of them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=341.38s)]
*  All these folks he had just been fundraising from as Treasury Secretary. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=343.3s)]
*  Then came the billions from Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=346.74s)]
*  Mnuchin and Kushner both took the government officials who had extensively been working [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=348.54s)]
*  with them on this government project and installed them at their new private ventures where they [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  would get the money. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=357.26s)]
*  In April of last year, when Mnuchin sent the Saudis a roster of the top executives at his [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=359.5s)]
*  new private venture for them to invest in, one of the managing directors was still, at [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=363.74s)]
*  that moment, employed by the U.S. Treasury Department. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=368.26s)]
*  I mean, this isn't even like speeding up the revolving door between government and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=370.62s)]
*  the private sector. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=375.46s)]
*  This is like, there's no door. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=376.46s)]
*  It means you go to work for the U.S. government and in the name of the U.S. government, you [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=378.22s)]
*  raise money for yourself. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=383.62s)]
*  On the one hand, it feels like, you know, another bit of corrupt detritus from the Trump [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=387.54s)]
*  administration that has stuck to our collective national shoe. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=392.26000000000005s)]
*  On the other hand, this feels like something so blatant it cannot possibly stand. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=395.58000000000004s)]
*  Can it? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fz6kSaQ36o&t=401.90000000000003s)]
