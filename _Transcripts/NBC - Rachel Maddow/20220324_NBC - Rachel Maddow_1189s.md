# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 23
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q)
*  Exactly one month ago, the two prosecutors leading the Manhattan District Attorney's investigation into Donald Trump and his business practices abruptly resigned. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Those two prosecutors had been leading a case that was centered around the allegation that Trump was inflating the value of his assets in order to obtain favorable loans from banks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=10.0s)]
*  And by all accounts, it was an investigation that appeared to be gaining momentum. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=21.0s)]
*  But according to the reporting at the time, those two very high profile prosecutors resigned after the newly elected DA tasked with overseeing the case, quote, indicated that he had doubts about moving forward with the case against Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=26.0s)]
*  Now, tonight, The New York Times has published the resignation letter from one of those prosecutors, and it is remarkable. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=41.0s)]
*  This is the resignation letter of special assistant district attorney Mark Pomerantz sent to the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg last month, quote, As you know, from our recent conversations and presentations, I believe that Donald Trump is guilty of numerous felony violations of the penal law in connection with the preparation and use of his annual statements of financial condition. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=48.0s)]
*  The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=72.0s)]
*  He did. Mr. Pomerantz noted in his letter that the previous district attorney overseeing the case, quote, concluded that the facts warranted prosecution and he directed the team to prevent present evidence to a grand jury and to seek an indictment of Mr. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=78.0s)]
*  Trump and other defendants as soon as reasonably possible. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=93.0s)]
*  The letter then explained that the current district attorney Alvin Bragg decided not to seek criminal charges, at least not yet, and that the investigation has been suspended indefinitely. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=97.0s)]
*  While Mr. Pomerantz did not question the district attorney's authority in making his decision or his sincerity in believing that it was the right call, he argues in the letter that, quote, a decision made in good faith may nevertheless be wrong. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=109.0s)]
*  I believe that your decision not to prosecute Donald Trump now and on the existing record is misguided and completely contrary to the public interest, end quote. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=126.0s)]
*  He continues, We believe that the prosecution would prevail if charges were brought and the matter were tried to an impartial jury. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=136.0s)]
*  Whatever the risks of bringing the case may be, I am convinced that a failure to prosecute will pose much greater risk in terms of public confidence in the fair administration of justice. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=144.0s)]
*  I fear that your decision means that Mr. Trump will not be held fully accountable for his crimes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=156.0s)]
*  I have worked too hard as a lawyer and for too long now to become a passive participant in what I believe to be a grave failure of justice. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=163.0s)]
*  I therefore resigned from my position as special assistant district attorney, effective immediately. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=173.0s)]
*  We should note the current Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg has said that his office continues to conduct this investigation, and because of that, he's barred from commenting on it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=179.0s)]
*  President Trump, of course, denies the allegations of fraud. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=188.0s)]
*  Mr. Pomerantz himself declined to comment about the letter to the New York Times. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=191.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Barbara McQuade, the former United States attorney. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=195.0s)]
*  Barbara, good to see you tonight. You're the person we need to talk to about this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=199.0s)]
*  This is quite a remarkable development that this kind of letter would be written. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=202.0s)]
*  It was probably not written to be leaked to the press. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=207.0s)]
*  But what do you make of it? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=210.0s)]
*  It is a remarkable letter, Ali. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=212.0s)]
*  You know, when when these two prosecutors resigned abruptly as they did, I think most of us speculated that there was a difference of opinion as to the merits of this case and that they were leaving because Alvin Bragg had said that although the investigation was continuing, we know that the grand jury activity had abated. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=215.0s)]
*  And so we knew that they were unhappy with the direction of the case. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=234.0s)]
*  And now we see why. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=239.0s)]
*  Although I'm not sure I agree with you that this wasn't written to be leaked to the press. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=241.0s)]
*  It is in such detail. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=245.0s)]
*  Certainly Alvin Bragg knew all of the reasons that Mr. Pomerantz was resigning. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=248.0s)]
*  And so it seems like this one perhaps was written for the press. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=252.0s)]
*  And maybe it was I don't know who leaked it to the press, but it seems like someone who leaked it to the press perhaps had an agenda. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=255.0s)]
*  And so I think that might be an interesting question as to why is this out in the public domain? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=261.0s)]
*  What is it that Mark Pomerantz is trying to achieve? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=266.0s)]
*  And it may be to put pressure either on Alvin Bragg or some other entity to pursue this case. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=268.0s)]
*  Well, let's explore that a little bit because in the letter he talks about this being a failure of the justice system. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=274.0s)]
*  He doesn't want to be party to that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=282.0s)]
*  He says that the risks of not prosecuting are greater than the risks of prosecuting. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=285.0s)]
*  So tell me in the system, inside the system, this gets leaked. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=291.0s)]
*  It puts Alvin Bragg on his back feet. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=295.0s)]
*  What exactly could happen as a result of this? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=298.0s)]
*  Well, I suppose, you know, Alvin Bragg is an elected official that he might feel political pressure to go forward. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=302.0s)]
*  When people say even your own very skilled, very experienced prosecutors are telling you you have this case, you can't be too skittish. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=308.0s)]
*  Now, you'll note there's nothing in the letter that accuses him of misconduct or corruption or anything like that, just that they have a difference of opinion. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=315.0s)]
*  But then Mr. Pomerance is absolutely convinced, as well as his colleagues, that there is a crime here and that not only can it be brought, but it should be brought. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=323.0s)]
*  And so I suppose one goal for leaking this letter would be to put public pressure as an elected official on Alvin Bragg to take this step. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=330.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's also important to note, Ellie, that reasonable minds can disagree about whether charges should be brought. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=340.0s)]
*  There are certain kinds of crimes that are very obvious to us, a bank robbery. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=346.0s)]
*  We see the crime happen. We know the crime happened. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=350.0s)]
*  The only question for trial really is whether this is the right defendant, whether this is the person who did it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=353.0s)]
*  In these fraud cases, it's much more challenging because what it usually comes down to is knowledge and fraudulent intent. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=357.0s)]
*  And unless a person confesses to you, that evidence is never going to be crystal clear. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=363.0s)]
*  And so people will disagree as to how much is enough. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=368.0s)]
*  How much inference are we going to ask a jury to make to conclude that in this case, Donald Trump did know that these statements were false and lie. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=371.0s)]
*  And so it may be that Alvin Bragg wants to amass more evidence before he's willing to get there. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=380.0s)]
*  But what Mr. Pomerantz seems to be saying is we've got all the evidence we're ever going to have. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=385.0s)]
*  It's not going to get better. In fact, it's going to get worse as time passes. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=389.0s)]
*  And now is the time to file this case. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=392.0s)]
*  And so perhaps he's saying if you won't, then perhaps the Southern District of New York will take note. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=394.0s)]
*  Or perhaps you could request that the attorney general's office, the state attorney general's office, get a referral and come in and take this case off your hands if you won't do it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=398.0s)]
*  I want to turn now to Ina Sovson. She's a member of the Ukrainian Parliament. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=407.0s)]
*  She's joining us live from Kyiv. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=410.0s)]
*  Ms. Sovson, thank you again for being with us. I know it's the middle of the night. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=412.0s)]
*  You have two hats. On one hand, you're a member of parliament. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=416.0s)]
*  On the other, you've been involved in the people that Cal was just talking about. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=419.0s)]
*  Ten million people not in their homes, four million having fled the country. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=426.0s)]
*  This humanitarian disaster is almost overtaking the discussion about NATO and its relationship with Ukraine and what its obligations are. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=431.0s)]
*  Well, truly, it is a terrible disaster, humanitarian disaster here in Ukraine. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=439.0s)]
*  We just got some polls released which says that 44 percent of Ukrainians had their families split because of the war. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=446.0s)]
*  So part of the family is living in one place and other part of the family is living in a different place. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=453.0s)]
*  That is 44 percent. That's half of the Ukrainians who are not living with their loved ones. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=458.0s)]
*  And that is extremely difficult. That is extremely complicated. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=462.0s)]
*  I'm saying as a mum, I was not able to see my son for three weeks. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=465.0s)]
*  I didn't want to see him last week. I came back to Kyiv, however. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=470.0s)]
*  I haven't seen my boyfriend since day one of the war. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=474.0s)]
*  It's extremely complicated, extremely difficult. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=478.0s)]
*  But we all understand that the only solution to that is just help us win in this war. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=481.0s)]
*  And then we can be reunited with our loved ones. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=486.0s)]
*  You heard Cal talking about the fact that the NATO leaders and perhaps President Biden will reiterate this concept of red lines that certainly involve any kind of nuclear threat that Russia's got, but even chemical weapons. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=491.0s)]
*  Are you satisfied that that red line goes far enough, given the imagery that we're seeing, the destruction of these homes, the forced movement of people out of the country? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=504.0s)]
*  Or to other parts of the country? Is chemical weaponry the right place for that line? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=515.0s)]
*  Well, there should definitely be the red line. All the stories I'm reading from Mariupol, they all scream red line to me. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=521.0s)]
*  I read the story about a woman who came to Hungary today and she came with four children. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=529.0s)]
*  Only one of the children was hers. Another one was one was her niece. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=536.0s)]
*  Her parents died. One more child was the child of the neighbors who died as well. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=542.0s)]
*  And the fourth child was she was just running to the vacation bus and she saw a child was sitting next to his dead parents scared and was just sitting on the street didn't know what to do. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=549.0s)]
*  And she just grabbed the child and ran for the bus. So she brought their four children. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=560.0s)]
*  Three of them were orphans. This is a story that I want the world to know. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=565.0s)]
*  This is what is happening over there. So can you imagine a child? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=569.0s)]
*  I was always thinking about my own son. If my son was sitting there with his parents dead and not knowing where to go and it just randomly saved by a stranger. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=573.0s)]
*  That is what is happening there. That is the genocides. That is like the World War Two. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=583.0s)]
*  And I am just begging for the world to understand that this is as scary as it gets. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=587.0s)]
*  It's even in Kiev where it is rather quiet and rather, you know, it's much better than it was three weeks ago. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=592.0s)]
*  We just got the warning that because of the fires in the Chernobyl nuclear area, which Russians are not allowing to put down, there is more amount of cesium in the air. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=599.0s)]
*  We are not allowed to open our windows and we are advised to wear masks on the streets. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=611.0s)]
*  That is in Kiev. That is again the red line that we all understand that it is there. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=616.0s)]
*  I just want the world to know that this is real. This is really scary. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=621.0s)]
*  And I think the red line has been crossed a long time ago. Just think about the child sitting next to his dead parents. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=626.0s)]
*  I do believe that should be the red line. And I'm just I'm going to join my president in saying that we need the help, all the help that we can get to fight with this monster. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=631.0s)]
*  You are from the eastern city of Kharkiv. Last week we were talking about a fire in a in a open air market and you had you had talked about the fact that your father actually had worked there at some point. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=640.0s)]
*  You've relocated your son Martin to western Ukraine. So you are you are seeing all parts of this around the country. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=650.0s)]
*  Western Ukraine is relatively peaceful right now. How do you see this developing? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=656.0s)]
*  We had a report that Ukrainian forces are actually pushing Russian forces back around Kiev. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=661.0s)]
*  Yes, that is given us hope. Of course, we understand it's going to take a while. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=667.0s)]
*  There are still many Russian troops around the city, but Ukrainian forces is really regaining some parts of the city. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=672.0s)]
*  But we are the heavy battles. We are seeing some lights and explosions around the city. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=679.0s)]
*  But we do hope that they will manage to push them further from Kiev. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=686.0s)]
*  But there are warnings and we all understand that this is the possibility that if Putin will realize that he's losing around Kiev totally, then he will go for the next step, which would be the chemical weapon, which we are all being warned about. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=690.0s)]
*  So on the one hand, the fact that Ukrainian army is regaining control over northwest of the city is given us hope. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=704.0s)]
*  On the other hand, it is also scary because we don't know how Putin will react to that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=713.0s)]
*  Inna Sovson, there's no part of this war that has not touched you or your family. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=720.0s)]
*  And yet you take time to talk to us. We appreciate that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=724.0s)]
*  It is important that this message gets to the world. Inna Sovson is a member of the Ukrainian parliament. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=727.0s)]
*  Thank you for your time. Please stay safe. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=732.0s)]
*  Joining me is someone who has been inside the room for the last two weeks. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=735.0s)]
*  Joining me is someone who has been inside the room for critical talks such as this one. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=739.0s)]
*  Ivo Daldr served as the U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=744.0s)]
*  He's now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=749.0s)]
*  Ambassador, good to have you here. Thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=752.0s)]
*  I want to ask you about this meeting. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=755.0s)]
*  The world is looking for a response from NATO to the worsening atrocities in Ukraine. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=758.0s)]
*  What do you think needs to be the headline out of tomorrow's NATO summit, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=763.0s)]
*  which is probably the most watched in more than 20 years? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=767.0s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=772.0s)]
*  I think the headline should be a warning to Vladimir Putin that any further escalation, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=773.0s)]
*  in particular using chemical or biological weapons or agents or, God forbid, nuclear weapons, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=779.0s)]
*  will, as the secretary general said, fundamentally change the assessment that NATO has had [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=785.0s)]
*  with regard to its role in this conflict. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=791.0s)]
*  I don't think that NATO can stand by. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=794.0s)]
*  I don't think the United States can stand by if Vladimir Putin decides to use these heinous weapons [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=797.0s)]
*  that are designed fundamentally to kill people, civilians in cities and other places to be really effective [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=803.0s)]
*  and say, well, we'll send you some more Javelin missiles. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=812.0s)]
*  We need to continue to help Ukraine defend itself. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=816.0s)]
*  But if that happens, in my view, we need to be prepared to help Ukraine directly to defend its country against this kind of attack. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=819.0s)]
*  The hope, of course, is that saying that will prevent Vladimir Putin from moving in this direction [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=828.0s)]
*  and prevent the use of chemical weapons and prevent the use of nuclear weapons, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=835.0s)]
*  because we're all much better off if that doesn't happen. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=840.0s)]
*  I understand there are horrible things happening in Ukraine, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=844.0s)]
*  but this is a step that would fundamentally change the strategic calculus and the situation. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=847.0s)]
*  So I was just talking to the member of parliament, Ina Sovson, who is in Lviv. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=853.0s)]
*  She's from eastern Ukraine. Her son is now in western Ukraine. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=860.0s)]
*  And she was saying that the good news today is that the Ukrainian forces seem to have pushed the Russians back in some points around Lviv. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=863.0s)]
*  The bad news, she fears, is that every day that Vladimir Putin hasn't taken Ukraine and hasn't succeeded [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=872.0s)]
*  may be a day closer to either the use of chemical weapons or more airstrikes or things that are more damaging. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=879.0s)]
*  How do you assess that? How does NATO and these leaders tomorrow, how do they assess that calculus? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=885.0s)]
*  Well, I think she's right, unfortunately. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=890.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is not going to say, oh, my God, I made a mistake and pull his troops out. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=893.0s)]
*  He, as the intelligence community concluded a few weeks ago, Bill Burns, the CIA director, said to Congress, he's more likely to double down. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=900.0s)]
*  And I think one of the reasons you heard the president say this morning, again, warning about a threat of chemical weapons, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=909.0s)]
*  one of the reasons there is now very serious concern within the administration about looking at the particular ways in which Putin can escalate and we need to respond. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=916.0s)]
*  And one of the reasons this is going to be an issue tomorrow in Brussels at the meeting is because Vladimir Putin has not been able to achieve his military objectives. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=927.0s)]
*  And he is likely, unless he understands that the cost to him will even be greater, he would be likely to escalate. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=937.0s)]
*  That's why it's important for NATO to make clear that if that happens, NATO is prepared not only to impose serious consequences, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=945.0s)]
*  but at least quietly tell him it would mean that NATO gets involved in the war and then he would really lose in Ukraine. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=956.0s)]
*  Evo Daldur, thank you for your analysis, for your time. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=965.0s)]
*  You know what is actually going to be happening tomorrow. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=968.0s)]
*  At least you're the closest to knowing how that kind of thing goes. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=971.0s)]
*  So we appreciate your time tonight. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=973.0s)]
*  Evo Daldur is a former United States ambassador to NATO and the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=975.0s)]
*  Now, Poland became a member of NATO in 1999 and 1999 is relevant because that year the alliance was faced with another crisis that was beyond its borders. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=982.0s)]
*  Less than two weeks after Poland joined NATO, NATO began a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia with the goal of getting the Serbian ruler Slobodan Milosevic to pull his forces out of neighboring Kosovo, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=995.0s)]
*  where he was massacring Kosovo Albanians in a campaign of ethnic cleansing. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1008.0s)]
*  And it was right in the middle of that bombing campaign and ongoing negotiations to try to strike a deal with Milosevic that this happened. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1013.0s)]
*  Now the war over Kosovo and the dramatic development that was formally announced today, Slobodan Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal by the International Tribunal in The Hague. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1024.0s)]
*  Milosevic and four of his top lieutenants are charged with the mass murder of 340 Kosovo Albanians, the deportation of 740,000 and still more charges are likely. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1034.0s)]
*  But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright suggests instead of dealing with Milosevic, he should be removed from power to stand trial before the world court in The Hague. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1045.0s)]
*  We have made clear that we would not go for any kind of immunity. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1054.0s)]
*  Now that was the first time in history that a head of state had been indicted for war crimes. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1059.0s)]
*  And U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Milosevic would face justice, no immunity deals. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1065.0s)]
*  She would go on to institute a policy of withholding U.S. aid to Yugoslavia unless they handed over Milosevic for prosecution, a strategy which ultimately worked. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1071.0s)]
*  Slobodan Milosevic was extradited to The Hague in 2001. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1082.0s)]
*  When he died in 2006, his trial on charges of genocide was ongoing. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1086.0s)]
*  Madeleine Albright, America's first female secretary of state, was herself a child of European strife. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1091.0s)]
*  Born in Czechoslovakia in 1937, her family fled the country twice. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1097.0s)]
*  First from the Nazis, then from the Soviets. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1103.0s)]
*  Just a couple of days after Milosevic was indicted, Albright delivered a commencement address at Georgetown University and said this. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1108.0s)]
*  The great lesson of this century is that when aggression and brutality go unopposed, like a cancer they spread. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1115.0s)]
*  And what begins as a treatable sickness in one part of the body can rapidly endanger the whole. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1124.0s)]
*  That was 1999, the very end of the century she was describing. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1131.0s)]
*  And the implicit hope was that by learning the lessons of the 20th century, its horrors could be avoided in the 21st. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1136.0s)]
*  Madeleine Albright died today. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1144.0s)]
*  She was 84 years old. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1146.0s)]
*  Flags have been lowered to half staff at the White House in her honor. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1148.0s)]
*  And her death comes on the day that the U.S. Senate has passed a bill that would allow her to be released from prison. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1151.0s)]
*  And her death comes on the day that the U.S. president is arriving in a Europe once again facing war to meet with NATO leaders facing their greatest crisis in decades. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=172XA2hd74Q&t=1159.0s)]
