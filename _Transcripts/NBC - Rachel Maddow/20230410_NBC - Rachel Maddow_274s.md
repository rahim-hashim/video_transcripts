# Death toll grows in Louisville, Kentucky bank shooting
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco)
*  This is awful. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=0.0s)]
*  I have a very close friend that didn't make it today. So when we talk about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=5.5s)]
*  praying, I hope people will. My A. G. Campaign was out of that building. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=9.08s)]
*  I know virtually everyone in it. That's my bank. Yes, I know that there are [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=14.6s)]
*  steps that the police department is taking to do things better after a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=17.8s)]
*  recent report, but we certainly saw, I think the very best from them today. I [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=21.6s)]
*  want to thank them and all our other law enforcement officers [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=26.44s)]
*  responding and doing their best [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  to try to save some of my friends and many others. Thank you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=34.14s)]
*  Thank them for responding and doing their best to try to save some of my [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=39.44s)]
*  friends. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=42.72s)]
*  I was Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear speaking today. It is a remarkable [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=44.84s)]
*  thing, but I suppose it was probably statistically inevitable, given the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  number of mass shootings we now have in this country. Today, the governor of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=52.8s)]
*  this state, where this latest mass shooting happened, had to announce that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=57.04s)]
*  he personally knew multiple victims in this gun massacre in downtown Louisville. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Governor Beshear said that one of the people killed today was one of the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=67.6s)]
*  governor's closest friends. He said today, quote, Tommy Elliott helped me [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=70.74s)]
*  build my law career and helped me become governor. He gave me advice on [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=74.88s)]
*  being a good dad. He's one of the people I talk to most in the world. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=77.92s)]
*  Remarkably, look at this. Florida Senator Rick Scott, Republican Senator [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=84.52s)]
*  Rick Scott of Florida tonight, also tweeted his condolences to Tommy [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=88.26s)]
*  Elliott's family, saying he too considered Mr. Elliott a friend, said he [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  was somebody he'd known for many years. Now, since we've come on the air [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=96.68s)]
*  tonight, just this hour, the death toll in today's mass shooting in Louisville [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=100.6s)]
*  has climbed. I said at the top of the hour that of the 13 people who were [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=104.16s)]
*  shot today, four of them had died. Since we have been on the air, another one of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  the people who was shot has succumbed to those wounds. So it's now five people [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=113.24s)]
*  dead and eight more injured. In addition to Tommy Elliott, the other victims have [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=118.28s)]
*  been identified as Jim Tutte, Joshua Barak, Julianna Farmer, and now newly, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=123.88s)]
*  Dina or Deanna Eckert, whose name was just confirmed by local police a short [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=130.12s)]
*  time ago. Among the eight other people who were injured, there's a 26 year old [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=135.4s)]
*  police officer among them, an officer named Nicholas Wilt from the Louisville [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  Metroville Police Department. He was shot in the head while responding to the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  incident. Officer Wilt underwent brain surgery this morning. He's in critical [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=147.66000000000003s)]
*  but stable condition. I should tell you, Officer Wilt, as you can see how young [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  he is here, he had only been on the job for 10 days when he reported for work [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  this morning. According to local police, responding officers arrived on the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=160.4s)]
*  scene in three minutes after they first were alerted to the shooting. They [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=164.84s)]
*  exchanged gunfire with the suspect who was killed at the scene. Police have [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=169.6s)]
*  confirmed that the shooter was an employee of the bank. They've also [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=172.84s)]
*  confirmed that he live streamed his attack today on social media, which is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=176.32s)]
*  a thing they do now. The mayor of Louisville, Craig Greenberg, himself [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=181.68s)]
*  survived a shooting last year. A gunman entered his campaign office on [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=187.4s)]
*  Valentine's Day last year, opened fire directly at him. He was very nearly shot [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  himself. A bullet went through his sweater that he was wearing without [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=197.28s)]
*  hitting him. Just a miracle. The mayor thanked police officers for their [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=201.28s)]
*  actions today called today's events an evil act of gun violence. As I noted at [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=207.12s)]
*  the top of the show, as police responded to this shooting at the Old National [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=212.16s)]
*  Bank in downtown Louisville, other police officers who were part of the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=216.16s)]
*  call had to peel off because there was another deadly shooting two miles away, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=219.68s)]
*  less than two miles away at Jefferson Community and Technical College. Police [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  say these two incidents, while simultaneous and while less than two [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=227.28s)]
*  miles apart were otherwise not related because this is how we Americans live [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=231.28s)]
*  now. Two shootings, one after the other, less than two miles apart, at least six [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=237.76s)]
*  people dead in the two of them. Here, this is business as usual with many of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  us, including a governor, probably having known a victim of gun violence or [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  more by now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iakjv-1Lgco&t=251.44s)]
