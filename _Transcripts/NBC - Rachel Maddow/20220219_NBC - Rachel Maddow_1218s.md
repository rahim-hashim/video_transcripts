# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 18
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ)
*  If you're a soccer fan, maybe even if you're not, you probably recognize this guy, Cristiano Ronaldo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Widely considered to be one of the greatest players in soccer history and currently among [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=6.88s)]
*  the highest paid athletes in the entire world, which is why Cristiano Ronaldo turned a few [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=11.44s)]
*  heads in the world of New York real estate this week when he sold his apartment in Trump Tower [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=17.2s)]
*  for less than half of what he paid for it in 2015. Half. Now, it's not like Ronaldo [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=24.56s)]
*  was hurting for cash. This is the kind of thing an uber rich person does [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=31.84s)]
*  only when looking to get out of a bad investment before it gets worse. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=35.68s)]
*  And Cristiano Ronaldo is not the only one fleeing Trump Tower. Back in September, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=40.64s)]
*  the luxury skyscraper was put on a financial watch list by Wells Fargo due to Trump Tower's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=46.24s)]
*  rapidly declining occupancy rates. So Ronaldo may be part of an elite exodus, but there is [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=52.48s)]
*  one tenant who does not appear to be leaving Trump Tower anytime soon. The Washington Post [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=59.12s)]
*  reported last year that Donald Trump's political action committee is aligning the ex-president's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=64.64s)]
*  pockets by spending over $37,000 a month to rent office space in Trump Tower, office space that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=69.84s)]
*  sits empty. But Trump may have good reason to be funneling campaign donations into the struggling [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=77.68s)]
*  gem of his real estate empire. That's because Trump's $100 million loan on Trump Tower comes due in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  September. Tick tock. He also owes $590 million in loans that will come due within the next four [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  years, more than half of which Donald Trump has personally guaranteed, meaning he is on the hook [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  for hundreds of millions of dollars if those loans aren't paid. That could be a significant [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=104.4s)]
*  problem for the former president now that his longtime accounting firm, Mizzars, has essentially [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  warned the world against lending money to Trump, saying the 10 years of financial statements they [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=114.64s)]
*  prepared for him, for from him, cannot be relied upon. So what does this all mean for the immediate [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  future of Donald J. Trump and his business? Joining us now is David Ferenhold, an investigative [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=128.24s)]
*  reporter now with the New York Times who has done extensive reporting on Trump's finances and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=134.16s)]
*  business dealings. David, thanks for joining us tonight. No problem. So Trump's big loans start [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  maturing this year. We have September as our due date for Trump Tower. How do you think the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=146.32s)]
*  statement from Mizzars is going to affect his ability to handle those gigantic loans that are [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=151.04s)]
*  coming due? Well, it certainly doesn't help. As you said, Mizzars, this is Trump's longtime [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=156.16s)]
*  accounting firm. They know his finances better than anybody, and they're telling the world, look, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=162.72s)]
*  we can't vouch for Trump anymore. We can't vouch for the things he told us and the things we told [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=166.24s)]
*  other people on his behalf. That's certainly bad if you're Donald Trump and you want to try to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=171.04s)]
*  refinance those loans. You want to try to find new lenders. That said, Trump is moving out of the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=175.52s)]
*  businesses he's been in, the golf course business, the real estate business, the hotel business, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=182.48s)]
*  into a business of social media and SPACs on the stock market, basically monetizing politics. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=187.44000000000003s)]
*  So even if he's not a great credit risk in his old business, there's still a huge number of people [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=194.0s)]
*  who will give him money essentially for nothing because of political ties or political allegiance [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  that he might be able to tap to pay off loans on his existing properties. So you're convinced that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=204.0s)]
*  the political capital quite literally could help float him through the next several years? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=209.44000000000003s)]
*  Sure. If you look at that social media, the Trump SPAC, this investment that's on the stock market, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=213.68s)]
*  I mean, that has produced nothing. It has nothing. It's got plans to produce a social media network [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=220.08s)]
*  at some point, but people are already willing to put billions or at least hundreds of millions of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  dollars of investment into it. The stock price has gone through the roof. That shows you Trump can [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=229.52s)]
*  monetize his supporters in a way that can bring him in money even when he doesn't have a product. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=234.88s)]
*  So yes, I think that there is a ready source of cash for him to tap there that if he wants to, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=239.76s)]
*  he could use to bail out some of the properties in from his old life. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=243.68s)]
*  But I guess I wonder, we have this, I think it's a civil deposition from the New York AG, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=246.56s)]
*  Letitia James. Is that not going to affect his standing with creditors as more information [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  comes out about how financially reckless he's been, even if he has the political capital? Or [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=258.4s)]
*  do you think that people can separate those two things? Well, it certainly won't help with his [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=263.92s)]
*  creditors. But I do think that that deposition, those civil and criminal investigations that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=269.12s)]
*  seem to be closing in on him are problems for him. But you have to remember this in some ways, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=274.72s)]
*  this is a little bit like Trump's situation in Atlantic City when he ran into hard times in the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=279.44s)]
*  early 2000s or in New York when he ran into hard times in the early 90s. He owes so much money to [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=283.6s)]
*  so many people, there's an incentive there where those lenders, the people who Trump owes money, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=290.08s)]
*  don't want him to fail because then they get nothing. And so there's been a couple of times [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=295.92s)]
*  in Trump's life before when people have been willing to say, look, he owes us a ton of money, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=299.68s)]
*  we're willing to cut that debt down, give him a break in hopes of getting something rather than [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  getting nothing. So he's pulled that card before. And if things got really bad in his real estate [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  empire, his banks might see that situation the same way, even though they might have a right to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=312.48s)]
*  call on these loans or try to cancel them. What's in it for them? They want money. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=316.72s)]
*  Today, we got an important ruling in three civil cases, a dozen members of Congress and multiple [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=321.12s)]
*  Capitol police officers brought against Donald Trump and others for their role in inciting the [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=327.68s)]
*  insurrection on January 6th. A federal judge in D.C. denied President Trump's efforts to dismiss [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=333.12s)]
*  those lawsuits. In his 112 page ruling, the judge said the evidence suggests that Trump [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=340.32s)]
*  assembled the crowd and then instructed the rally goers to march on the Capitol despite knowing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=346.16s)]
*  that the crowd likely included violent and destructive elements. The judge's decision [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=351.68s)]
*  to keep the cases alive leaves Trump and his inner circle vulnerable to more depositions and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=356.72s)]
*  document requests. But importantly, the decision also declares Trump potentially financially liable [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=362.16s)]
*  for conduct while he was the sitting president, which the judge acknowledged was a rare and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=369.36s)]
*  momentous legal decision. So not only does this open the possibility that the president will have [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=374.48s)]
*  to pay damages, cold, hard cash to the people who allege he hurt them by inciting January 6th, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=380.0s)]
*  but it also sets the precedent that Trump could be liable for any of his conduct while he was the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=387.44s)]
*  sitting president if that conduct was really about his reelection and not about his actual [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=392.8s)]
*  duties as president. It is a lot to unpack. Joining us now is Barbara McQuade, former U.S. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=398.16s)]
*  attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. Barbara, thank you so much for spending time with [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=404.32000000000005s)]
*  us and helping us along this journey. Let's start with the decision today. The judge is denying the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  president immunity from civil damages while he was a sitting president. Are we right to see that as a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  potentially really significant development here? Absolutely. This is a brand new ground that has [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=421.84s)]
*  been broken here. Ordinarily, the president gets immunity for any action he takes while he's [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  president, and that is seen as necessary to give him comfort that he can do things that might be [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=434.96s)]
*  unpopular and very difficult. But what the judge said here is that when Donald Trump was standing [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=440.08s)]
*  out there in the ellipse on January 6th, he was not acting in his capacity as president. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=445.52s)]
*  He was acting in his capacity as a failed candidate for president. He was talking about [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=450.4s)]
*  his complaints about the election. And for that reason, the judge said he was not entitled to the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=455.76s)]
*  kind of immunity he would ordinarily enjoy. And he's potentially personally financially liable [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=461.2s)]
*  here, right? I mean, am I correct in thinking that this could end up costing President Trump money [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=467.67999999999995s)]
*  from his own pocket? That he would have to take out his personal checkbook and potentially pay [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=474.0s)]
*  damages to Pramila Jayapal and Eric Swalwell and the Capitol police officers who brought this case? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=479.76s)]
*  Absolutely. You know, we've been hearing earlier in the week about his finances and how he inflated [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=487.2s)]
*  some of his assets. We don't know whether it was five billion or eight billion that he had, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=492.88s)]
*  but we may soon find out if he has to write some big checks here. And I think sometimes people [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=496.56s)]
*  diminish the role of civil law as compared to criminal law when holding people accountable. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=501.44s)]
*  But, you know, for some people like Donald Trump, hitting them in their pocketbook can be [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=507.28s)]
*  a very powerful message that is punitive to him, but also provides some compensation for the harm, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  the pain, the suffering, the death, the destruction that occurred on January 6th. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=517.6s)]
*  The other important thing about civil liability is sometimes that is the best way to right a wrong, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=522.0s)]
*  because the legal standard there, rather than in a criminal case where you have to prove a case [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=527.76s)]
*  beyond a reasonable doubt, in a civil case, you only have to prove a case by a preponderance of [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=532.64s)]
*  the evidence. So it explains the kind of thing where you get an acquittal in a case against O.J. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=537.3599999999999s)]
*  Simpson, for example, but then he is found liable in the civil case because that legal standard is [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  different. And so while it may be difficult to hold Donald Trump accountable criminally, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=547.28s)]
*  it could be that it's the civil case that finally does so. What about the materials involved when [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  we're talking about civil cases, right? In terms of the former president's vulnerability to [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=556.7199999999999s)]
*  subpoenas and document requests in this case, is there a difference between what a civil prosecutor [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=561.44s)]
*  can get access to compared to what a criminal prosecutor could get access to as it pertains to [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  all of this? Yeah, you know, they're different. You don't have the grand jury to work with when [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=574.24s)]
*  you're a civil litigator, the way a criminal prosecutor does, and that can have a lot of power [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  in building an investigation. And so ordinarily in the civil case, as long as you have a, you know, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  a well-planned complaint and you have investigated your legal theories, you can go forward and then [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=590.1600000000001s)]
*  uncover the facts as the case proceeds. And that's what we might see happen in this case. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=595.44s)]
*  Today's decision opens the opportunity now for that civil discovery to take place. So the noticing [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=600.1600000000001s)]
*  of depositions, the request for documents. Today's effort was very much the motion that was filed, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=606.72s)]
*  that was decided today, was an effort to stop it, nip this case in the bud before we go down that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=612.48s)]
*  path of civil discovery. Now that that motion has been rejected, that opens the floodgates [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=617.36s)]
*  for depositions and document requests. And so I imagine we will see that in the coming months. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=622.72s)]
*  It was 144 years ago that members of the Democratic Party first met in convention [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=628.64s)]
*  to select a presidential candidate. Since that time, Democrats have continued to convene once [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=641.12s)]
*  every four years and draft a party platform and nominate a presidential candidate. And our meeting [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=649.8399999999999s)]
*  this week is a continuation of that tradition. But there is something different about tonight. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=657.8399999999999s)]
*  There is something special about tonight. What is different? What is special? I, Barbara Jordan, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=665.2s)]
*  am a keynote speaker. Yeah, she was more than four decades ago. Barbara Jordan took the stage [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=673.9200000000001s)]
*  at the Democratic National Convention and made history as the first black woman to deliver the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=683.5200000000001s)]
*  keynote address. That moment was a first among many in her political career. Just a decade before [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=688.6400000000001s)]
*  that speech, she became the first black person since reconstruction to win a seat in the Texas [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=694.72s)]
*  state Senate. It was during her time there as president pro tempore that she also served as [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=701.2s)]
*  the first black female governor for a day when the governor and lieutenant governor were both out of [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=707.12s)]
*  the state on government business. Jordan would go on to serve as the first black woman to represent [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=712.64s)]
*  Texas in Congress, serving three terms in the house. But her illustrious career started in a [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=717.76s)]
*  unassuming way, registering people to vote. In 1960, while volunteering on JFK's presidential [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=724.48s)]
*  campaign, Jordan managed a get out the vote program in Houston. And it is that part of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=731.36s)]
*  Jordan's legacy that's inspiring another young woman from Texas in her push to expand voting [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=736.72s)]
*  access across the state. Taylor Coleman is a Democratic strategist who decided to live out of [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=741.84s)]
*  her van, a van named Barb after Barbara Jordan, as she drives all over the Lone Star state trying to [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  register as many voters as possible. Her effort could not come at a more critical time. In just [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=754.0s)]
*  over a week, Texans go to the polls to vote in the first primaries this election year. But a new [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=760.48s)]
*  restrictive law has already forced officials across the state to reject ballots. And Harris County, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=766.48s)]
*  the largest county in Texas by population, the county elections office tells us that as of [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=772.16s)]
*  yesterday, they have tossed out 4,453 mail in ballots, citing issues with ID requirements. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=777.28s)]
*  That is about 34% of all the ballots they have received in the mail as of yesterday. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=785.68s)]
*  And that's in addition to the more than 4,700 mail in ballot applications that were rejected [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=792.56s)]
*  because they also did not meet these ID requirements. That's about 14% of all the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=799.04s)]
*  mail in ballot applications received in the county. Now Harris County wants the federal [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=804.4s)]
*  justice department to investigate, asking the department in a letter to, quote, exhaust every [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=809.76s)]
*  legal option available to ensure that each eligible voter in Harris County and the state of Texas has [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=814.48s)]
*  their vote counted. Texas's new election law is so extreme that voting rights groups are also worried [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=820.3199999999999s)]
*  it could criminalize the act of helping a disabled voter at the polls, given that the new legislation [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  adds restrictions to those people assisting voters. It is obstacles like these that give [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=832.4s)]
*  Taylor Coleman's work purpose and urgency. She recently told the Houston Chronicle, quote, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=838.64s)]
*  what we're going through right now reflects some very tense moments in our country's past. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=843.28s)]
*  And voting rights for me is how I knew I would be able to make sure that people who look like me [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=848.4s)]
*  would continue to have a say. Ms. Coleman, thank you so much for taking time for us this evening. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=853.6s)]
*  Are you in the Barb van? I am in the van. Thank you so, so much for having me. That explains my [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=858.72s)]
*  poor connection today. But I'm so glad to be here with you guys. Thank you so much for having me. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=868.4s)]
*  We're so glad you're there, Taylor. We are hearing these reports about ballots being tossed, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=873.6s)]
*  you know, the application process being fraught at best and concerns about access to the polls for [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=879.52s)]
*  people who are helping disabled voters. All of this a result of SB1, Texas's new voting law. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=884.96s)]
*  What have you been hearing from voters as you're going around the country trying to [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=890.64s)]
*  navigate these restrictions and get people registered to vote? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=895.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, Alex, I mean, I've seen exactly what has been portrayed in the news reports that [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=901.6s)]
*  you cited. You know, just today, I was on the road actually with the caravan with Black Voters [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=907.92s)]
*  Matter. And when I was at the county elections office, just as I was in line waiting to get [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=915.04s)]
*  certified here in Texas, you actually have to be legally certified in a county to register voters [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=921.8399999999999s)]
*  there. Just as I was waiting in line, there were two people turned away trying to help register [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=927.92s)]
*  their elderly grandparents or parents to be able to vote by mail. Today is the last day to do that. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=936.08s)]
*  And unfortunately, they were turned away because, you know, their elderly parent or grandparent was [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=943.84s)]
*  not with them. So they couldn't show their ID. So they, you know, were turned away. They were not [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=950.32s)]
*  able to get those vote by mail applications. And, you know, I overheard one of the gentlemen there, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=956.1600000000001s)]
*  you know, saying, you know, his mother is 95 years old. You know, she's not going to be able [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=962.24s)]
*  to make it to the polls. And so in order to, you know, vote by mail, you have to show your ID. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=966.08s)]
*  All of these hurdles have very, very real impacts on Texans. And so I'm just, I'm glad I'm able to [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=973.92s)]
*  shed some sort of light on what's going on down here. Taylor, what are people saying? Are they [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=980.16s)]
*  angry? Are they frustrated? Are they more focused than ever on trying to get these ballots cast? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=985.92s)]
*  What's the mood? I think people are very frustrated. Not only are voters frustrated, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=992.24s)]
*  you have people who have voted by mail for decades. You know, a voter that is, you know, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1001.12s)]
*  well into her 90s has been eligible to vote by mail for, you know, over nearly 30 years. And to [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1007.44s)]
*  have these laws changed, you know, right before a new election is very frustrating to voters. And [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1014.4000000000001s)]
*  also not just frustrating to voters, but also to the county elections officials who have to [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1020.96s)]
*  enforce some of these rules. You know, I think you mentioned at the top of the show how, you know, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1027.44s)]
*  the different lawsuits and things that are being brought to try to fight back against some of these [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1033.6000000000001s)]
*  restrictions. I know that there was a specific county elections official who really, you know, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1038.88s)]
*  her argument was that this is a First Amendment issue. It is a state jail felony, actually, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1047.4399999999998s)]
*  for a nonpartisan election official to be considered soliciting mail-in, vote by mail [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1053.36s)]
*  applications. So these rules are not only frustrating to voters who, you know, maybe weren't [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1060.56s)]
*  as tuned in to what's happening, but, you know, as it starts to impact them, they're confused by the [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1067.36s)]
*  changes. It's definitely an extra burden for the nonpartisan election officials who are just trying [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1072.64s)]
*  to do their jobs without risking jail time. Taylor, I just have one quick question. I mean, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1079.1200000000001s)]
*  given the thicket of red tape here, I believe in Texas you have to become a deputy registrar [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1084.4s)]
*  in the country, in the county where you want to register voters. And there are like 254 counties [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  in Texas. How have you managed to pull this off? I'll say it has not been easy. Just today, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1094.8s)]
*  you know, people have asked, you know, what's your itinerary? What's your plan? It's actually very [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1103.76s)]
*  hard to plan, you know, when the goal is, you know, hitting all of these counties to register [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1108.3999999999999s)]
*  voters. Just today, again, on this tour, you know, as Black Voters of Matter has been registering [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1114.32s)]
*  students at colleges across the state, there were several students and also people in the community [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1121.12s)]
*  who wanted to register to vote today. I was only certified in one of the counties, and they came [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1128.72s)]
*  from, you know, neighboring counties. And Texas is a big state, but, you know, these are counties 15 [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1134.96s)]
*  minutes away. And not only am I not certified in some of those counties yet, but even the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1139.9199999999998s)]
*  the voter registration applications, you have to have them for the specific county where the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1146.96s)]
*  voter lives. So all of these rules seem so benign on paper. But when 254 counties, and again, these [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1152.96s)]
*  election workers, sometimes they're just a one man show. You know, I had one county election worker, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1161.52s)]
*  I mean, she was in tears, you know, when I showed up to try to get certified, because [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1168.0s)]
*  in the midst of everything else that she has to do to prepare for an election, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1172.8s)]
*  she has to drop everything to fill out some paperwork so that a fellow Texan can help [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  register other Americans to vote in her county. And it is unnecessarily prohibitive. You know, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1182.24s)]
*  all of this could be solved with online voter registration, which we know is safe and secure, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1190.3999999999999s)]
*  and Texas has chosen not to do that. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXFS8lVJRzQ&t=1195.36s)]
