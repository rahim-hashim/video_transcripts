# 'Seditious Conspiracy' Is Tough To Prosecute But Couldn't Be A More Fitting Case: McQuade
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8)
*  I wanted to ask you, Barbara, about this landmark seditious conspiracy indictment charge that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=0.0s)]
*  the DOJ has brought against the leader of the Oath Keepers, Stuart Rhodes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=5.78s)]
*  You're one of the few lawyers having prosecuted a seditious conspiracy case yourself in 2010, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=10.44s)]
*  so we're very lucky to have your expertise with us. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  But I'm sure you've seen the debate that this has ignited about how difficult of a threshold [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=18.42s)]
*  a conspiracy charge is, a seditious conspiracy charge is. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=22.7s)]
*  How hard do you think will it be to prove this case? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=27.24s)]
*  Is it a hard case to handle? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=31.02s)]
*  It is a difficult charge to prove. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=33.98s)]
*  In fact, the case that I brought in 2010 against a militia group in Michigan that was plotting [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=36.339999999999996s)]
*  to kill police officers ended up being dismissed because the judge believed that there was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=40.86s)]
*  insufficient evidence of a conspiracy to commit that plot. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=45.66s)]
*  So it can be difficult. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  However, I think some things have changed from that time. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=50.7s)]
*  I think that the public in the time that has passed since then has a deeper understanding [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=53.660000000000004s)]
*  of the very real threat that militia groups pose to our federal government and to our [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=59.260000000000005s)]
*  public safety. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=63.82000000000001s)]
*  I also think that the nature of these charges are much stronger than anything I've seen [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=64.82000000000001s)]
*  before. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  They actually showed up at the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification that would [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  transfer power from one president to another. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=75.7s)]
*  If there's ever a case for seditious conspiracy, this is it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=78.78s)]
*  And if this isn't it, then what is seditious conspiracy? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=81.8s)]
*  So technically, it really only requires proving the use of force against the government's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=84.24s)]
*  authority. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=91.52s)]
*  And so I think technically they have it here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=92.52s)]
*  And I also think in terms of just the feel that a jury gets from these charges, it feels [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=94.12s)]
*  like an appropriate charge here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=97.84s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  A valid question. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  What is it if it's not this? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  Barbara McQuade, former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=103.2s)]
*  Barbara, it is always a pleasure to have you here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=106.68s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=109.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj4g02fgxw8&t=111.78s)]
