# 'Firewall for freedom': The plan to protect U.S. democracy from Donald Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4)
*  The quite unexpected news this weekend that ABC News would settle a defamation suit with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=0.0s)]
*  President-elect Trump and pay him $15 million. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=6.68s)]
*  Had the president-elect licking his chops today at a press conference talking about [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=12.4s)]
*  the prospects he imagines for going after more media outlets. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=17.52s)]
*  He said he plans to sue somebody, the people of Iowa. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=22.3s)]
*  Their newspaper wasn't totally clear. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=28.1s)]
*  He plans to sue someone over a poll late in the election season that showed Trump doing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=29.68s)]
*  well in, sorry, Trump not doing as well as he did in Iowa. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=35.92s)]
*  Since he eventually won Iowa, he thinks that's grounds for a lawsuit because that poll said [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=41.28s)]
*  he might lose it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=45.32s)]
*  The especially hairy thing that he said today was that actually he shouldn't have to bring [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=47.56s)]
*  suits like this himself. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=51.86s)]
*  He expects that the Justice Department, the U.S. Department of Justice, should bring lawsuits [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=53.5s)]
*  like this on his behalf. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=57.88s)]
*  The dynamic that's emerging for the second Trump term is not just that powerful people [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=61.2s)]
*  want to be able to use their own power to harass their perceived critics. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=65.44s)]
*  It's that the new president-elect expects, he expects that he will be able to use not [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  just his own power and influence, but he will be able to use the U.S. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=75.5s)]
*  Government to harass and punish his critics. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=79.28s)]
*  And it's not just the Justice Department he plans to use. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=83.92s)]
*  Today, the outgoing chair of the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, responded [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=86.88s)]
*  again to Trump's demands that the FCC should strip licenses from a news network that made [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=91.24s)]
*  him mad. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  The outgoing chair said, quote, the FCC has no business threatening to take away broadcast [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=99.96s)]
*  licenses because the president doesn't like the content or coverage on a network. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=103.6s)]
*  Head of the election, Trump talked about using the U.S. military domestically to target Americans [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  who oppose him or protest against him, the so-called enemy from within. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=115.6s)]
*  Now, he's reportedly planning on creating a new board overseeing promotions and senior [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=119.88s)]
*  officers in the U.S. military, which would allow him to purge military leadership of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  anybody who is disloyal to him or who disagrees with him or who has different politics. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=132.12s)]
*  Trump and his allies are also reportedly considering withholding federal money from states or cities [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=138.84s)]
*  that don't go along with plans like his mass deportation idea. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=144.92s)]
*  It feels like a lot because it is a lot and it's happening all at once. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=151.76s)]
*  But how do local governments and news organizations and ordinary citizens think strategically [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=154.32s)]
*  about this when Trump is threatening and saying he expects to use the most powerful government [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  on earth against its own citizens to attack his critics? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=165.84s)]
*  What can your mayor or your governor or your local paper or some voluntary organization [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=171.04s)]
*  you might be part of do to stand up against that in a time like this? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=175.20000000000002s)]
*  Just the person to ask. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=180.76s)]
*  Joining us now is Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=181.76s)]
*  Anthony, it's really nice to see you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=186.16s)]
*  Thank you for coming in. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=187.52s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=188.52s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=189.52s)]
*  Having you and Tim Snyder here on the same night feels to me like I won the lottery. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=190.52s)]
*  I really appreciate you being here. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=192.8s)]
*  Oh, it's great. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=193.8s)]
*  It was great to be with you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=194.8s)]
*  Tell me about how you at the ACLU are thinking about your plans to try to defend American [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=196.48s)]
*  civil liberties in this term versus the first term. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=204.88s)]
*  Well, we've been planning for almost a year. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=207.72s)]
*  We were anticipating the possibility that he would win this election. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=210.3s)]
*  So we've spent thousands of staff hours studying Project 2025, tracking the campaign promises, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=213.84s)]
*  going back and playing back what happened in Trump 1.0 to see what might happen with [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=220.88s)]
*  Trump 2.0. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=224.86s)]
*  And so we've been trying to get ready for this whole period of time. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=226.5s)]
*  Clearly we can run the same playbook. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=230.34s)]
*  They're going to be more aggressive. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=232.58s)]
*  They're smarter. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=233.94000000000003s)]
*  They're faster off the block. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=235.22000000000003s)]
*  They are really going for the they're running the gauntlet on many of the policy issues [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=237.38000000000002s)]
*  that they didn't dare try last time. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=241.22000000000003s)]
*  They're going to run the ball down the field. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=243.18s)]
*  And so we have to be much smarter and much better prepared. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=245.3s)]
*  Litigation is going to be key. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=248.58s)]
*  The courts still are a place we would have to turn to. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=249.66000000000003s)]
*  We have to be wide eyed that the courts are also increasingly conservative and he will [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  appoint new judges onto the courts. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=256.4s)]
*  It's also true that Biden appointed a record number of judges on the courts and so not [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=259.58s)]
*  all is lost. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=263.38s)]
*  But good lawyers are going to have to earn their pay by picking the right clients, the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=264.38s)]
*  right cases, the right theories. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=268.97999999999996s)]
*  Where do you file? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=270.88s)]
*  Where do you settle? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=271.88s)]
*  Where do you really push the envelope? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=272.88s)]
*  And that's what really we're working through right now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  You talk to regular Americans who aren't lawyers, who aren't people who are engaged in this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=277.5s)]
*  fight in a practical, paid to do it as part of their job kind of way. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=283.58s)]
*  And you hear people feeling intimidated, feeling overwhelmed by the pace at which we're getting [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=287.26s)]
*  sort of alarming news about the extremism of their plans. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=292.98s)]
*  What do you tell them about the prospects for holding line? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=297.26s)]
*  Local governments, you know, the state attorneys general, the governors, the mayors, we have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=300.7s)]
*  this whole plan around a firewall for freedom, we call it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  The idea that these local officials can really play an important role in stopping the worst [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=309.02s)]
*  of the government abuses. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=314.14s)]
*  How so? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=315.14s)]
*  Well, for instance, when they're going to try to detain and deport all these hundreds [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=316.14s)]
*  of thousands, up to a million people, that's an operation that they have the legal power [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=319.38s)]
*  to do, to do the raids, but the logistics. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=324.66s)]
*  And they're going to need mayors and governors or city councils to either give them access [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=328.42s)]
*  to police officers or not, jails. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=334.44s)]
*  We're going to house all these folks. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=337.88s)]
*  And so part of what we're doing is we're preparing executive orders and we're organizing our [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=340.36s)]
*  folks to put pressures on elected officials so they don't roll over. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=344.08s)]
*  They should sever these relationships they have with the federal government on immigration [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=349.2s)]
*  enforcement. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=352.68s)]
*  They should make sure that our prisons and our jails are off limits. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=353.68s)]
*  They should begin to think about what actions they could take to pardon immigrants who have [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=357.64s)]
*  a criminal record because they drove in a suspended license. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=363.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, let's take them out of harm's way. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=366.48s)]
*  They could do that now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=368.68s)]
*  Let's commute. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=369.68s)]
*  They could do that now in a transition. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=370.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=371.68s)]
*  And so part of what we've got to do is we've got to swarm our allies in some of these places. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=372.68s)]
*  And even in red states, you have some blue mayors. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=376.68s)]
*  And so there's a whole game plan for this. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=380.36s)]
*  And I think part of what we're trying to do is breaking it down, what can be done by the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=382.6s)]
*  courts and lawyers, what can be done by citizens, what can governors do, what can mayors do, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=385.72s)]
*  and really have a game plan for that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  When people look at the fact that there haven't been large scale protests thus far the way [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=393.52s)]
*  there were pretty soon after the election in 2016, I tend to look at that and think [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=396.96s)]
*  the American people are smart. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=401.68s)]
*  People are marshaling their resources. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=403.12s)]
*  They're waiting. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=404.12s)]
*  Choosing for the right moment. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=405.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=406.12s)]
*  Do you see it the same way? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=407.12s)]
*  Totally. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=408.12s)]
*  When he starts deporting all these folks, ripping apart communities, the idea that you're [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=409.12s)]
*  never going to be able to move that many people through the immigration system without ripping [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=412.96s)]
*  apart citizens and immigrants. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=416.36s)]
*  It's going to rip the basic fiber of our lives. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=418.52s)]
*  That's when people are going to say, oh, that's not what we bargained for. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=421.96s)]
*  We've got to turn out. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=425.0s)]
*  Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=426.44s)]
*  There's a lot on your shoulders, my friend. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=429.48s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  I have a lot of friends helping me. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jjmnotzqa4&t=451.76s)]
