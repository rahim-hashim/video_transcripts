# Maddow: More information about election processes is key to fighting Trump vote subversion tactics
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8)
*  In Arizona, Maricopa County, just after the 2020 election, this was outside the vote counting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=0.0s)]
*  center in Phoenix. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  Election workers were tabulating the ballots inside, and Trump supporters, at least some [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=7.66s)]
*  of them armed, were outside the building doing this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  And some of what they were doing was calling out elections workers by name. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=16.62s)]
*  Workers had to be escorted in and out of the building by police. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=20.98s)]
*  Arizona was one of the toughest locations in the country for intimidation and threats [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  of violence directed at election workers, directed at election officials in particular. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=28.8s)]
*  Arizona was also one of the states where fake Republican electors signed fraudulent certificates [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=34.6s)]
*  falsely certifying that Trump had won their state when in fact he lost their state. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  Eleven Arizona Republican fake electors were indicted earlier this year in that plot. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=43.84s)]
*  The state Republican Party responded by choosing three of the people who'd been indicted to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=49.96s)]
*  become delegates to the Republican National Convention. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=54.540000000000006s)]
*  Thank you for your service. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=57.68s)]
*  Now as the 2024 election approaches, Arizona has more to contend with. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=59.92s)]
*  The Washington Post recently reported that election officials in at least three battleground [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=63.58s)]
*  states, including Arizona, received nearly identical letters from the American Conservative [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=67.88s)]
*  Union, the group that puts on the CPAC conference. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=72.52s)]
*  The letters explained the American Conservative Union's plan to monitor ballot drop boxes [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=75.08s)]
*  and scrutinize those using them to vote. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=80.64s)]
*  The letters prompted concerns from election officials about privacy and the possibility [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=84.12s)]
*  of voter intimidation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  Adrian Fontes is a former top Maricopa County elections official. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  He's now Arizona's secretary of state. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=93.84s)]
*  He told the Post in response to that reporting, quote, the whole thing is an absurd sham to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=96.02000000000001s)]
*  cover up direct efforts to intimidate voters by a bunch of CPAC recruited vigilantes. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  The effort's purpose, he said, is to intimidate voters and we absolutely will not be cooperating [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  with them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=113.52s)]
*  Joining us now is Arizona's secretary of state, Adrian Fontes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=115.32s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for being here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=117.84s)]
*  It's nice to meet you in person. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  Nice to see you too. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  Everybody in the country has eyes on Arizona worrying about the kinds of not just contentious [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=122.48s)]
*  campaign stuff that is a healthy part of our democracy, but worried about voter suppression, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=127.08s)]
*  worried about certification of the vote, worried about potential intimidation of both voters [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=132.68s)]
*  and people running the system. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=137.4s)]
*  What should the country know about Arizona this year? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=139.52s)]
*  It's the same thing they should know about all the rest of election officials across [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  the entire United States of America. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=144.88s)]
*  These are good civil servants who have been doing great work across the entirety of our [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=146.6s)]
*  nation and in Arizona. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=150.28s)]
*  They've been doing exceptionally good work for a long time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  There's been a little bit of turnover, but you really still have the same character of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=154.56s)]
*  folks, neighbors, friends, relatives, American citizens, just like you and me, doing a great [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  job. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  That's what people can know about elections in Arizona and in the United States of America. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  We, Americans, we're the ones that run our elections. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=168.32s)]
*  The criminal indictment was brought in Arizona against Republicans who had submitted their [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=171.84s)]
*  names as false electors, claiming that Trump had won when in fact Biden had won. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=176.88s)]
*  That criminal prosecution meant serious consequences, potential consequences. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=181.52s)]
*  I mean, indictment itself is a consequence, but really serious consequences for those [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=189.2s)]
*  The Republican Party responded by giving new, essentially, honors and leadership positions [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=190.2s)]
*  to a significant number of those who had been indicted. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=196.16s)]
*  That was a real message of support for what they had done. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  I wondered if you think that that sort of political decision, that sort of leadership, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=202.32s)]
*  makes things harder. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=206.56s)]
*  You could say it makes things harder, but at the end of the day, our job is to just [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=208.56s)]
*  run our elections. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=211.76s)]
*  We stick with the fundamentals. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=213.04s)]
*  We make sure everything's good to go, and we leave the campaigning and the politics [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  to the campaigns and the politicians. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  As an election administrator, I certainly know what my duty is, and I will operate within [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=219.6s)]
*  those bounds. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=224.26s)]
*  I have my political opinion, too. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=225.26s)]
*  I happen to be a statewide elected Democrat. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=226.6s)]
*  I was at the DNC. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=228.48s)]
*  I'll have my personal choices when it comes to voting, but I can separate my duty from [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=229.48s)]
*  my opinion, and I think there's a lot of folks out there that kind of confuse the two. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=234.84s)]
*  And so really, I think we're in a good space in Arizona as far as election administration [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=239.6s)]
*  is concerned, but the messages that other people send are for their intended audiences, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  and that's a political thing that we just aren't going to get too involved in. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=248.64s)]
*  What have you had to change in terms of training, preparation, resources, roles, in order to [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  make sure that election administration is safe and done properly? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=257.64s)]
*  Well, how much time do we have? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=260.92s)]
*  Since I was elected and took office in January of 2023, we have been revamping just about [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=262.24s)]
*  everything. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=268.08s)]
*  You know, the only secretaries of state we've had since 1983 were folks who came from the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=269.08s)]
*  legislature or other politicians. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=272.88s)]
*  We didn't have elections administrators coming up from the counties since then, and so we've [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=274.94s)]
*  really had to look at our training and give to the 15 counties in Arizona the resources [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=279.76s)]
*  they need from the perspective of, look, you guys are the ones who are recruiting poll [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=285.2s)]
*  workers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=289.36s)]
*  You're the voter registrars. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=290.36s)]
*  You're the ones that are running the tabulations equipment. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=291.36s)]
*  You guys are doing all the work down there. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=292.64s)]
*  We are a regulator in Arizona. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=294.4s)]
*  We are a bottom-up state. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=296.32s)]
*  Some states, the secretary of state is a top-down position, and they run everything. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=297.84s)]
*  Not here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=302.12s)]
*  So we have that different perspective, which has informed everything that we've done, from [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=303.12s)]
*  working very closely with CISA, the Critical Infrastructure Security Agency under the Department [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=308.0s)]
*  of Homeland Security, all the way to doing, injecting some artificial intelligence and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  some deepfakes into our tabletop exercises with elections officials, law enforcement [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=318.2s)]
*  officials and even members of the media who we've brought into these trainings so that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=322.96s)]
*  folks can understand the processes better so that when folks in the media tell the story, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=327.0s)]
*  they won't have to learn the system first and then try to tell the story on those deadlines. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=331.88s)]
*  They can already have that background information. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=336.46s)]
*  So we're working with the entire community of folks who have to deal with this to make [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=338.12s)]
*  sure everybody is prepared. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=342.8s)]
*  I will say, on that last point, that commitment as a member of the media, like, obviously [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=343.8s)]
*  I want us to have access and everybody knows, I want us to know as much as we can. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=348.36s)]
*  But it is actually, I think, a national security matter around elections that members of the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=351.72s)]
*  media are well positioned and well informed to be able to tell people what's disinformation [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=355.92s)]
*  and what's real. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=361.82s)]
*  At a time when a lot of these wars are going to be fought on the information space, having [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=362.82s)]
*  an informed media matters. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=366.58000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=367.8s)]
*  And really understanding some of these very complex processes, the technology behind it, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=368.8s)]
*  the laws and the rules behind it, that doesn't happen immediately. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=371.64s)]
*  So when someone from out of town comes into Phoenix or Tucson or wherever, we need to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=375.4s)]
*  make sure that they've got that base of information, just like our elections officials, just like [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  our voters. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=383.4s)]
*  We need to make sure folks are informed so that they can perform their constitutional [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=384.5s)]
*  duties and we can just move on with the rest of our lives. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T748C7XZLs8&t=388.03999999999996s)]
