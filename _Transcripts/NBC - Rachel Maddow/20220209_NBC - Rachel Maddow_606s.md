# Canada Afflicted With Right-Wing American Covid Conspiracy Chaos
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg)
*  We're now on day 13 of what officials in the Canadian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=0.0s)]
*  capital of Ottawa are calling an occupation. For the past two [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=3.96s)]
*  weeks, hundreds of truckers have been camped out on the streets [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=7.96s)]
*  in their vehicles, bringing the city center of Ottawa to a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  virtual standstill. The truckers calling themselves a freedom [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=15.24s)]
*  convoy originally came to Ottawa to protest a requirement that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=19.16s)]
*  Canadian truck drivers crossing the US border be fully [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=23.04s)]
*  vaccinated. But those protests have since escalated. They've [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=26.32s)]
*  started spreading beyond the capital. We've now entered day [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=29.6s)]
*  three of protesters blocking the busiest crossing in North [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=32.88s)]
*  America, the Ambassador Bridge, which links Windsor, Ontario to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  Detroit. About 200 people in vehicles are blocking or [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=41.08s)]
*  snarling traffic on that bridge, which carries 25% of all trade [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  between the US and Canada, or an estimated $300 million a day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Farther west, protesters in about 50 trucks are blocking the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=55.44s)]
*  Coots border crossing, which is the busiest port between [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=59.58s)]
*  Alberta, Canada, and the state of Montana. That crossing [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=62.699999999999996s)]
*  typically sees more than $40 million of goods pass through [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=66.38s)]
*  daily. And today, protesters blocked yet another [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=70.1s)]
*  transportation artery at the Michigan-Canada border. It's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=73.1s)]
*  important to note that as much chaos as these few hundred [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=76.74s)]
*  truckers and their 18-wheelers are causing, their view on this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=79.34s)]
*  issue is not popular in Canada at all. More than 80% of the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=82.9s)]
*  Canadian public is vaccinated. Almost 90% of Canadian truckers [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=86.98s)]
*  are vaccinated. This protest wasn't even organized by the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=91.62s)]
*  Canadian trucking unions, the largest of which has come out [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=95.14s)]
*  actively against the protests. So not only is this a fringe [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=97.94s)]
*  group of Canadians, it's a fringe group even within the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  small niche of Canadian truckers. But where this group [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=105.86s)]
*  is popular, this is interesting, where they found an incredibly [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=109.78s)]
*  large platform is right here with American conservatives and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=113.14s)]
*  American conservative media. Their stories become a staple on [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=117.78s)]
*  right-wing outlets like Fox News. American conservatives [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  from Glenn Beck to Marjorie Taylor Greene to the former [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=125.06s)]
*  president himself have all championed their cause. It's hard [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=127.94s)]
*  not to miss the Trump flags flying among the crowds in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=132.45999999999998s)]
*  Ottawa, also spotted in the crowds, Confederate flags, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=135.94s)]
*  QAnon banners, swastikas, none of which are common sites in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=140.38s)]
*  Canada. In addition to giving this fringe group one of the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=144.94s)]
*  world's largest megaphones, this American attention means the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  protesters have been able to fundraise millions and millions [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=151.17999999999998s)]
*  of dollars further amplifying their cause. This is a genuinely [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  complex political issue. People have the right to peacefully [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=158.5s)]
*  protest. I've strongly defended that, even if you don't agree [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=162.1s)]
*  with their point of view. And Americans conservatives and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=165.22s)]
*  American media are fanning the flames here, taking what would [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=168.14s)]
*  be a local issue and giving it international attention. Today, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  a copycat freedom convoy trucker protest started in France. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  Similar protests are underway in New Zealand, in Australia. And [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  this afternoon, NBC News confirmed that the Department of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=183.94s)]
*  Homeland Security in the United States is now warning law [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=186.45999999999998s)]
*  enforcement and public safety officials that a copycat trucker [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=189.45999999999998s)]
*  protest could begin in the United States this Super Bowl [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=192.77999999999997s)]
*  Sunday. The DHS bulletin says the department has quote received [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=196.86s)]
*  reports of truck drivers planning to potentially block [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=201.78s)]
*  roads in major metropolitan cities in the United States in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=204.82000000000002s)]
*  protest of among other among other things, vaccine mandates [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=208.3s)]
*  for truck drivers. The protest could begin as soon as Sunday in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=212.34s)]
*  Los Angeles to disrupt the Super Bowl, and then travel across the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=216.18s)]
*  country to disrupt President Biden's State of the Union in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  DC on March 1. Now, as much as this is an issue about pandemic [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  requirements and vaccines, it's somehow become an issue about [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=227.89999999999998s)]
*  democracy and how we make decisions collectively. As these [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=231.38s)]
*  protests spread internationally and come to us here in the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=235.26s)]
*  United States, how can we make sure we both defend the right to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  peacefully protest and don't let fringe minorities bully us into [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=241.29999999999998s)]
*  accepting their point of view? Joining us now is Timothy [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=245.1s)]
*  Snyder. He's a professor of history at Yale University. He's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  the bestselling author of On Tyranny 20 Lessons from the 20th [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=251.26s)]
*  Century. Professor Snyder, good to see you. This is a strange one [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=255.34s)]
*  because I'm not even sure as a Canadian that I knew what to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=258.38s)]
*  make of this or thought that it would be much but it's turning [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=262.46s)]
*  into something that's got tentacles and connections around [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=265.02s)]
*  the world with these anti-government protests and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=268.34s)]
*  gaining some connective tissue to bigger and sort of more [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=273.02s)]
*  insidious protests that we're seeing. What do you make of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=277.58s)]
*  this? Yeah, I mean, like you, I was a little bit uncertain at [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=279.58s)]
*  first. I have a lot of friends and colleagues in Canada who [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=283.62s)]
*  write to me about the work that I do and usually what they're [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=286.3s)]
*  writing about is their concern about their friends in the South, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  their concern about the United States. These last couple of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=292.26s)]
*  weeks is the first time that I've had lots of Canadians [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=294.82s)]
*  writing to me and saying, hey, you as an American need to speak [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=296.74s)]
*  out about what's happening in Ottawa. And I think they think [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=300.02s)]
*  they're right. I think what's concerning about this is, as [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=304.41999999999996s)]
*  you've already said, we're talking about a minority of a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=307.94s)]
*  minority of a minority. I mean, there are only there are about [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=310.14s)]
*  15,000 long haul truckers in Canada, maybe 10% of them are [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=312.58s)]
*  directly affected. That's that's 1500 people. And the thing [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=317.02s)]
*  they're protesting against is not actually Canadian law, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=320.9s)]
*  they're protesting against American law. It's American law [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=323.62s)]
*  that they have to be vaccinated. So protesting in Ottawa makes [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=326.34s)]
*  zero sense. So it's a very small group with a nonsensical claim, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=329.22s)]
*  which nevertheless has begun this spiral which threatens [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=333.78s)]
*  both the institutions of Canadian democracy, as we see [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=337.62s)]
*  in the capital of Ottawa, and also the Canadian economy, as [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=342.29999999999995s)]
*  we've seen the border crossings. So what I worry about here is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=346.46s)]
*  that we're seeing a kind of model where a very small number [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=349.9s)]
*  of human beings using tools like trucks funded from another [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=353.78s)]
*  country, as you've already reported, and fanned or [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=358.78s)]
*  encouraged by conspiracy theories on social media can do [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=362.29999999999995s)]
*  an awful lot of political and economic damage very quickly. So [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=365.42s)]
*  I'm seeing this as as a kind of model as a kind of dark politics [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=370.46s)]
*  that's emerging. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  And the model doesn't work in a vacuum, right? If these truckers [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=375.02s)]
*  existed, and nobody talked about them, that'd be one thing. What [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=378.14s)]
*  do you think the interest is that's coming from right wing [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=381.06s)]
*  media in the United States in these protests? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=383.98s)]
*  I think a big wedge of right wing politics in the United [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=387.18s)]
*  States is about the claim that government doesn't work. I mean, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=390.9s)]
*  it's a it's a form of right wing anarchism, basically. And so if [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=395.22s)]
*  that is your view, you take delight in chaos in your own [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=399.82000000000005s)]
*  country, but also and perhaps especially in other countries. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=403.42s)]
*  So it can become a kind of a kind of parlor game, you know, to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=407.46000000000004s)]
*  sit in Florida or in Washington, DC, or, you know, in a newsroom [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=410.06s)]
*  and root the truckers on in Canada, because you like [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=414.82000000000005s)]
*  destruction, you like chaos, you want to see the deconstruction [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=418.1s)]
*  of the administrative state. So if people who are carrying that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=421.66s)]
*  out before you before your eyes, you're just happy. So I think, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=424.86s)]
*  you know, the ideology here has to do precisely with dysfunction [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=428.94s)]
*  and disorder, and proving that government can't work. And of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=432.7s)]
*  course, the Canadian government generally works extremely well. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=436.5s)]
*  So if you can suggest that democracy doesn't work in [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=439.26s)]
*  Canada, you know, then you're making a strong argument about [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=441.5s)]
*  democracy in general. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=444.38s)]
*  And of course, this is why it's important to talk to somebody [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=445.54s)]
*  like you, because you study these matters, not just in the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=447.54s)]
*  United States, but around the world. And there is a similarity [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=449.94s)]
*  to the types of protests that are going on around the world that [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=453.74s)]
*  seem to be anti government anti something, not entirely focused [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=456.82s)]
*  on the cause at hand, as you point out the the restrictions [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=462.82s)]
*  that these Canadian truckers are protesting by causing, you know, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=465.70000000000005s)]
*  blockages and trouble in Canada are generally speaking, not [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=470.62s)]
*  Canadian laws. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=474.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we don't I mean, we don't have to go so far afield [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  to find examples of this. I mean, in the United States for [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=481.74s)]
*  the past couple of years, protests, which presumably had [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=485.3s)]
*  something to do with vaccine mandates, branch out very [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=488.34s)]
*  quickly into much larger conspiracy theories. It's really [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=491.54s)]
*  striking to me how the conspiracy theories that turn up [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=494.5s)]
*  in the social media backdrop of some of the organizers of the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=497.94s)]
*  Canadian protests are basically the same generic stuff that we [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=500.3s)]
*  also have in the US or we find in Europe or around the world, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=503.66s)]
*  the same QAnon, the same ideas about Bill Gates, it's all it's [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=506.62s)]
*  all generic now. It's all international now. But I mean, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=510.18s)]
*  another way that you can think about the connection between [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=513.54s)]
*  Canadians and the rest of the world here is that you can flip [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=515.82s)]
*  this around and think about America now as a kind of bad [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=518.3s)]
*  actor, right? Like if there are lots of Russians who are [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=520.78s)]
*  contributing money to a GoFundMe and then to this, you know, then [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=524.1s)]
*  to this Christian site, which which then you know, funding [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=527.1800000000001s)]
*  disorder in the United States funding blockades in the capital [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=530.42s)]
*  funding funding blockades of border crossings, we would say, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=533.86s)]
*  hey, that's a hostile action. But right now, that's effectively [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=536.7s)]
*  what we're doing. We have some private actors in the United [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=539.34s)]
*  States and very, some very well known ones who are organizing [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=541.46s)]
*  behind the destruction of democratic institutions and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=544.98s)]
*  economic institutions in Canada. If we watch somebody else do [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=548.26s)]
*  that, we would say, hey, that's outrageous. I mean, if a former [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=551.86s)]
*  president of another country did what Mr. Trump just did to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=554.74s)]
*  Justin Trudeau and say that he's a fanatic who's destroyed his [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=557.58s)]
*  country, we would think, well, that's really excessive. That's [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=560.7800000000001s)]
*  really outrageous. So I think, you know, in a way, this puts us [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=563.62s)]
*  in the mirror. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=566.14s)]
*  It's a very strange development, this whole idea of QAnon, and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=567.14s)]
*  Trump flags and Confederate flags. In Canada, it's just, as [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=571.0600000000001s)]
*  you know, not a thing. So to see it becoming a thing is [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=575.1s)]
*  remarkable. Timothy Snyder, good to see you. Timothy Snyder is [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=578.02s)]
*  the professor at Yale University. He's the author of On [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=580.9s)]
*  Tyranny. We appreciate your time this evening. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I6CbAbFseg&t=584.1s)]
