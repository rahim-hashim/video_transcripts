# Trump's protest suppression tactic backfires as 'No Kings' events mushroom after L.A. confrontations
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4)
*  This Saturday, it's Flag Day. Happy Flag Day. It's also President Trump's birthday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=0.0s)]
*  It's also the day of his big North Korean dictator-style military parade in Washington. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  More tanks and guns unloading this afternoon outside Washington, D.C. Look at that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=10.0s)]
*  Saturday is also the day organizers are planning the next very large nationwide day of protest [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=16.4s)]
*  against Trump and what Trump is doing to the country. Even as Trump panics and inexplicably [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=23.5s)]
*  calls in the military over protests in Los Angeles, this Saturday's protests are being [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=28.24s)]
*  organized by a large coalition of groups and grassroots organizers in all 50 states, all [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=34.04s)]
*  across the country. They're calling it No Kings, the No Kings Day of Defiance. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  They said this today, quote, the No Kings mobilizations on June 14th were already planned [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  as a peaceful stand against authoritarian overreach and the gross abuse of power this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=49.86s)]
*  administration has shown. Now, this military escalation, meaning what's happening in Los [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=54.04s)]
*  Angeles, only confirms what we have known. This government wants to rule by force, not [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=58.64s)]
*  serve the people. From major cities to small towns, we will rise together and say we reject [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=64.24s)]
*  political violence. We reject fear as governance. We reject the myth that only some deserve [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=69.34s)]
*  freedom. On Saturday, June 14th, more than 1800 rallies will take place across the country, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=75.24s)]
*  peaceful, organized and united. The No Kings movement has posted a map online showing where [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=80.83999999999999s)]
*  those 1800 plus rallies will be held. I should tell you, and I think this is important, of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  those 1800, more than 100 of those have been added to the map since Trump announced that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=92.94s)]
*  he was sending the National Guard into L.A. If he was hoping to get people to not protest, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  it's backfiring. Organizers are going to hold a series of online trainings this week ahead [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=104.44s)]
*  of the big day. Tomorrow it's a know your rights training that they're doing nationwide [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=109.34s)]
*  by Zoom so people can better understand how to interact with law enforcement or provocateurs [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=113.34s)]
*  during the demonstrations. Then two days later, on Thursday, another big nationwide Zoom call, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=119.34s)]
*  they're calling it a pre-mobilization mass call. That's for anybody who's planning to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=124.44s)]
*  participate. Potentially tens of thousands of people are going to be on that call. It's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=128.84s)]
*  basically just to talk strategy ahead of the big day Saturday. But tonight, as the Trump [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=132.34s)]
*  administration does its best to turn the streets of L.A. into a war zone, as Trump's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=137.44s)]
*  flop sweat and lack of political ideas is manifested and National Guardsmen and now [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=143.74s)]
*  Marines being sent to the streets of L.A., the determination of the No Kings organizers [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=148.84s)]
*  appears to be clear. Many protests, bigger than ever, peacefully, joyfully, everywhere [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=155.24s)]
*  and unstoppable. There's nothing he fears more. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4&t=161.44s)]
