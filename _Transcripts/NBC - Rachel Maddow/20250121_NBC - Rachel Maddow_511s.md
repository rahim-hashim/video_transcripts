# Trump accused of 'decapitating' U.S. national security by appointing 'crackpots and fools'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w)
*  John Bolton, you remember him, mustache guy, Donald Trump's former national security advisor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=0.0s)]
*  He's had a secret service detail protecting him for years. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=6.2s)]
*  And that's not something national security advisors usually get. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=8.92s)]
*  But he's had one because somebody tried to hire a hitman to kill him. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=12.36s)]
*  That someone allegedly was the nation of Iran. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=18.52s)]
*  DOJ charged a member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard with a murder-for-hire plot against [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=21.96s)]
*  John Bolton. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=28.68s)]
*  And because of that, President Biden arranged for Bolton to have a secret service detail [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=30.16s)]
*  starting in 2021. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=33.76s)]
*  And it's not just John Bolton who has faced that kind of threat, specifically from Iran. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=36.84s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=41.6s)]
*  There's interesting reporting that some of the last warnings the outgoing Biden Homeland [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=42.6s)]
*  Security team gave to the incoming Trump team before the inauguration, some of their last [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=47.68s)]
*  warnings were about Iranian threats to kill current and former U.S. government officials. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=53.24s)]
*  So that was the last thing Biden's folks told Trump's folks before they walked out the door. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=61.44s)]
*  And then one of the first things Trump did when he walked in the door is he canceled [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=65.76s)]
*  John Bolton's secret service protection. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=70.0s)]
*  John Bolton responded today in part, quote, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  my criticisms of President Biden's national security policies. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=83.24s)]
*  He nonetheless made the decision to extend that protection to me in 2021. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=87.16s)]
*  Bolton says the threat to him from Iran remains, and quote, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=92.08s)]
*  I should also mention that Trump also revoked John Bolton's security clearance, as well [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=101.32s)]
*  as security clearances from a few dozen other former officials that Trump is mad at for [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=106.16s)]
*  various reasons. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=110.52s)]
*  But you know who Trump is giving security clearances to? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=113.12s)]
*  Really high level security clearances to? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=116.24s)]
*  Anybody. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=118.88s)]
*  Anybody who wants one. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=122.16s)]
*  Step right up. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=124.24s)]
*  No background check needed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=125.24s)]
*  Trump signed an executive order yesterday saying the White House will immediately grant [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=127.6s)]
*  the highest level of security clearance to personnel of the White House's choosing whether [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=131.44s)]
*  or not those people have been vetted at all. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=137.12s)]
*  Look under your seat. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=140.52s)]
*  You get a security clearance. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=141.68s)]
*  Speaking of security clearances, Tulsi Gabbard still doesn't have a date for her confirmation [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  hearing to be Trump's director of national intelligence. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=149.24s)]
*  It's still amazing to say. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  Senate Republicans have blamed a paperwork problem. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=154.24s)]
*  OK, but there also continues to be stuff like this new hair raising reporting from the Washington [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  Post. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=162.8s)]
*  Today's reporting on Gabbard casts doubt on her longtime explanation of a trip she took [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=163.8s)]
*  to Syria in 2017 as a congresswoman, a trip where she infamously met with the dictator [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=168.76s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad and then came back and refused to say that he was a bad guy for bombing and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=175.2s)]
*  gassing his own civilians. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=182.28s)]
*  Gabbard has also said it was a surprise. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=184.88s)]
*  She didn't expect to meet Assad on that trip, but she said the opportunity arose once she [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=187.72s)]
*  was there and she just felt spur of the moment like she should take it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=192.52s)]
*  The Washington Post's review today of documents and interviews with her congressional staff [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=196.24s)]
*  from the time show that she met with Assad basically immediately when she got there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=199.96s)]
*  She met with him for about three hours and then she met with him a second time. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=206.16s)]
*  One of her staffers from the time telling the Post today, quote, I will go to the grave [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=211.9s)]
*  believing that she lied to us. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  Her claim is that it just sort of happened. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  How do you just happen to meet with the leader of a police state? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=219.88s)]
*  Not once, but twice a Trump transition spokeswoman calls the Post story a quote, deep state smear [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=223.48s)]
*  campaign filled with gross misrepresentation and conjecture. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  But someday soon, Republican senators are going to have to decide if this is the right [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=236.48s)]
*  person who should be in charge of all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=240.6s)]
*  Joining us now is the journalist and author Tim Weiner. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=245.04s)]
*  He's the author of the seminal history of the CIA legacy of ashes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  His next book is called The Mission, the CIA in the 21st century. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=252.0s)]
*  It's out later this year. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=255.52s)]
*  I can't wait. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=256.52s)]
*  Tim, it's nice to see you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=257.52s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=258.84s)]
*  Hi, Rachel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=259.84s)]
*  What do you make of the choice of Tulsi Gabbard to be the nominee to be director of national [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=261.72s)]
*  intelligence with the nomination of Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=266.96s)]
*  Cash Patel for the FBI, Pete Hegseth for defense, John Radcliffe for CIA. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=273.16s)]
*  What you are seeing is an element of Trump's desire to decapitate the national security [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=279.8s)]
*  establishment of the United States. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=286.68s)]
*  Decapitate it meaning disable it? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=290.12s)]
*  By putting in empty heads in charge of it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=292.12s)]
*  You've written so much about the structure and history of the CIA and also the FBI. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=297.2s)]
*  Is the person at the top determinative in terms of not only the actions of the agency, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=302.52s)]
*  but potentially the fates of these agencies and these functions? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  Once when I was in Afghanistan, a mujahideen said, we have an old saying in our country, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=313.32s)]
*  the fish stinks from the head, which is a universal truth. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=317.6s)]
*  If you put in charge of the American national security establishment, crackpots and fools [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=323.32s)]
*  whose only qualification is their deathless loyalty to Donald Trump, you are not going [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=330.56s)]
*  to get good intelligence. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=338.4s)]
*  We are in a very dangerous moment in this world. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  We are approaching a state of total war in this world. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=345.52s)]
*  We have the axis of autocracy lining up against the Ukrainians, the Russians, the Chinese, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=350.08s)]
*  the Iranians, the North Korean lining up against Ukraine. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=355.88s)]
*  We've got a moment where we have to have smoothly functioning intelligence. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=360.64s)]
*  Intelligence is just a billion dollar word for information. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=370.12s)]
*  The president is supposed to know and care what's going on over the horizon. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=373.84s)]
*  The intelligence agencies, when they work, are in charge of anticipating surprise so [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=379.36s)]
*  you don't get a bolt from the blue, as we've seen in our lifetimes. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=384.92s)]
*  You cannot run an intelligence service if you are putting the people in charge and the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  people beneath them through loyalty oaths and ideological purity tests. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  This is what's happening in that executive order after he strips the national security [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=404.24s)]
*  clearances of five former directors and deputy directors of CIA, three of the guys who ran [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=409.48s)]
*  very nervy operations against the Russians, some of the best intelligence analysts of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=417.56s)]
*  our lifetime. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=422.3s)]
*  In the paragraph below he says, the director of national intelligence and the CIA director [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=423.3s)]
*  shall go into the ranks and root out people who are politically suspect. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=429.26s)]
*  If you do that, you are going to have people running for the exits rather than submit to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=437.34s)]
*  purity tests. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's a dangerous thing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=445.71999999999997s)]
*  What is the danger of giving out security clearances at the highest level as party favors [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  to anybody who asks for them at the White House without any vetting? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=456.46s)]
*  If I were a foreign intelligence service allied with the United States, would I want to share [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=462.17999999999995s)]
*  secrets with Tulsi Gabbard or some 25 year old who is a, you know, qualification as he [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=467.06s)]
*  wears a MAGA hat? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=474.76s)]
*  I would not. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=477.44s)]
*  I would think it would make the world a more dangerous place. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=478.7s)]
*  Tim Weiner, his latest book on the CIA will be out this summer. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=483.06s)]
*  Book me all ready for that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=487.22s)]
*  Tim, it's good to see you. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=488.22s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=489.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=490.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKoG9tFm2w&t=497.06s)]
