Video Description: Rachel Maddow outlines Donald Trump's intention as an authoritarian to consolidate the power of the United States government in himself, hollowing out the other branches of government and making them powerless puppets of his will. But even in the early days of Trump's transition we can see that Trump's intentions are not certainties as Americans are pushing back, insisting on democracy.

# Maddow: As Trump pushes to consolidate power, he is being met with a push for democracy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0)
*  If you win an election to take office as an elected official, you winning the election [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=0.0s)]
*  means you should also get the powers of that job, right? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=7.9s)]
*  There's nothing about administering elections that should be handed to partisan actors, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=14.36s)]
*  so that one party has a leg up in trying to win future elections. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=19.32s)]
*  That's just not the way it's supposed to work. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Trying to force those things is an anti-democratic, anti-small-D democratic power grab. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=25.88s)]
*  That happening so bluntly and so obviously, causing revulsion in so many people in North [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  Carolina, that of course is also happening in the larger context of what's happening [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=37.8s)]
*  in the country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=42.2s)]
*  And we are seeing, with the Republican Party ascending in Washington, we are seeing a really [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=44.56s)]
*  radical effort not to just advance and advocate for and plan to implement Republican policies, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=49.5s)]
*  we're seeing a really radical effort to change the American system of government, to consolidate [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=56.36s)]
*  power in one man's hands, to consolidate power within the executive branch of government. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=62.68s)]
*  All this talk you've heard about firing huge swabs of the federal government, wiping out [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=68.16s)]
*  whole departments, firing career law enforcement people, firing whole categories of civil servants, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=72.6s)]
*  all of that is about consolidating power in the executive branch. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=79.0s)]
*  So there is no source of authority or judgment within the federal government except for the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=82.92s)]
*  one guy at the top, except for Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=87.6s)]
*  Specifically, you've heard talk about them firing the FBI director, firing the chairman [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=90.52s)]
*  of the Federal Reserve. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=96.28s)]
*  Those are jobs that don't turn over when the presidency turns over. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=97.72s)]
*  They're specifically designed to be independent of the political cycle so that people in those [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=101.44s)]
*  jobs at the FBI and the Fed, they do what's right for the country and not just what's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=107.04s)]
*  right for any particular president. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=111.08s)]
*  But this insistence, this out loud insistence from the Republicans that Chris Ray at the FBI [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=112.88s)]
*  and Jerome Powell at the Fed somehow are going to be fired and replaced by Trump because [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=117.56s)]
*  he's coming in as the new president, that's not how the American system of government [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  is supposed to run. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=127.72s)]
*  That's about him consolidating his power over the executive branch, including the parts [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=128.4s)]
*  of it that are supposed to be independent from his power and control. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=133.56s)]
*  We are also seeing, even before the Republicans take power, efforts to consolidate power over [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=136.76s)]
*  the press, not just threatening and intimidating reporters and news organizations, but now, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  you know, saying they're going to use the power of the government to do it, having their [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=150.72s)]
*  presumptive appointees say that news organizations will be reviewed by the federal government [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=153.6s)]
*  according to their editorial decisions on news issues. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=159.6s)]
*  We're finally now getting some widespread discussion about their efforts to consolidate [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=165.0s)]
*  power also in just one man over the legislative branch of government. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=169.68s)]
*  So over the Fourth Estate, the press, over the executive branch, but also over the legislative [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  branch, over Congress, Trump demanding that the Senate not confirm his nominees, threatening [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=179.0s)]
*  to force the Senate to shut down so we can install his nominees without any confirmation [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=183.96s)]
*  hearings or votes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=188.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=190.28s)]
*  That is an effort to consolidate his power in such a way that it marginalizes and renders [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=191.48s)]
*  inert and unimportant the legislative branch of government, in that case specifically the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=197.2s)]
*  Senate. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=201.92s)]
*  But it's not just the Senate. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=202.92s)]
*  With Trump's austerity commission, this thing where they're going to cut trillions of dollars [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  out of the budget, an effort headed by eccentric right-wing billionaire Elon Musk. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  In order to do that, they are reportedly planning on seizing for themselves what's usually called [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=213.66s)]
*  the power of the purse, taking it away from Congress, just unilaterally cutting and reshaping [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=219.24s)]
*  the whole federal government without Congress being involved at all. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  So in Washington, as Trump and the Republicans are preparing to take power, Trump is working [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  really aggressively to consolidate all government power in Trump's hands. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=237.24s)]
*  He's looking to consolidate all the power of the executive branch in his own hands. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=243.32s)]
*  He's looking to consolidate all power in the government over the legislative branch, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=247.58s)]
*  supposed to be the co-equal branch of government, not going to be co-equal anymore. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=253.34s)]
*  He's trying to liminalize it, neuter it, make it unimportant, tell them what to do and expect [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=256.74s)]
*  them to do it. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=261.38s)]
*  He's also trying to do the same thing over the fourth estate, right, the so-called fourth [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=262.54s)]
*  branch of government, the free press. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  There's also the judiciary, right? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=271.66s)]
*  So far, frankly, I think he's been delighted how he's being treated by the third branch [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=274.1s)]
*  of government, by the courts, by the judiciary. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=277.94s)]
*  So we don't yet see him moving to defy the courts or defy court orders, but don't rest [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=280.66s)]
*  on that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  I think it's very possible that that is coming. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, honestly, if we're, I think, if you take a wide view of what's happening thus [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=289.54s)]
*  far with Trump taking power, preparing to take power in Washington, you see the efforts [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=296.04s)]
*  to consolidate power in the executive branch, to liminalize the legislative branch. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=300.0s)]
*  I think he's ignoring the judicial branch for now, but watch for it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=304.2s)]
*  Obviously, the efforts to intimidate the press, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=307.88s)]
*  This is all about trying to make sure that he's the only source of authority in the federal [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=311.36s)]
*  government. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=316.0s)]
*  Honestly, in terms of what to watch for next, I think we need to be watching for something [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=317.0s)]
*  that they call autocratic breakthrough. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=320.68s)]
*  Autocratic breakthrough is when the party in power uses the power they do have in government [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=323.74s)]
*  to make sure they can never be dislodged from government. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=329.88s)]
*  I'll give you a concrete example. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=332.88s)]
*  You've already seen in the House of Representatives, now that Mike Johnson is back in as Republican [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=335.52s)]
*  House Speaker, they changed the rules in the House to make it much harder to remove him [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=340.0s)]
*  as Speaker. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=344.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=346.12s)]
*  So that's them digging in, planning to stay for the long run. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=347.55999999999995s)]
*  Now we're here. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=350.88s)]
*  You're not going to be able to get us out. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=351.88s)]
*  You've seen Trump, quote, joking, end quote, about expecting to stay in office for a third [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=353.48s)]
*  term once this second term is up. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=359.76s)]
*  And that's, of course, against the Constitution. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  But he keeps repeatedly bringing up, bringing it up that that's his expectation. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  Trump adviser, his one-time campaign manager, Steve Bannon, saying things in public about [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  how they're going to be ruling for 50 years. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=375.6s)]
*  There won't be any way to dislodge them from power. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=380.0s)]
*  Autocratic breakthrough is when they use the powers they've achieved through winning [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=383.44s)]
*  elections to cement themselves in power so they can't be removed by future elections [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=386.48s)]
*  or by other democratic means. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  So we are watching the efforts to consolidate power. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=393.88s)]
*  We are watching for signs of autocratic breakthrough, trying to entrench themselves in power so [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=397.56s)]
*  they can't be removed. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=402.48s)]
*  This is just the way these things go. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  This is how strong men rule. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=405.68s)]
*  These are the things that they are trying. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=407.76s)]
*  That said, so far it's not clear that their efforts are going all that great. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=410.84s)]
*  The fact that they just want these things doesn't mean that they get them. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=416.67999999999995s)]
*  The fact that they're trying these things doesn't mean that they'll succeed. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=419.32s)]
*  I mean, we've already seen terrible nominees like Matt Gaetz being laughed off of Capitol [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=423.96s)]
*  Hill and having to have his nomination withdrawn. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  We're seeing Senate Republicans not yet caving and not yet agreeing to shut themselves down. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=432.4s)]
*  So Trump can have his nominees installed with no confirmation hearings. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=440.52s)]
*  The press turning out to be, yes, weak-kneed and lily-livered, as you might fear, in some [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=444.91999999999996s)]
*  quarters, but also defiant and professional and aggressive and creative in other quarters. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=451.4s)]
*  The American Free Press thus far, for example, has been doing a great job detailing the astonishing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  conflicts of interest and self-dealing and deep incompetence and lack of qualification [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=464.85999999999996s)]
*  the salacious and even allegedly criminal past dealings of the freak show lineup that [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=470.8s)]
*  Trump has announced as his nominees for high office. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=475.96000000000004s)]
*  And we'll get to some of those this hour. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=478.0s)]
*  So his intentions for who he wants to install and for what he wants to do and how he wants [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=481.04s)]
*  to consolidate power so the American government is essentially just the will of one man, those [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=486.56s)]
*  are just his intentions. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=491.12s)]
*  It's worth being clear that those are his intentions. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=493.12s)]
*  It's worth reporting on it, following it, being very clear-eyed about the fact that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=496.06s)]
*  that's what he's trying to do. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=500.52s)]
*  But just because those are his intentions, it doesn't mean those things are an inescapable [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=501.67999999999995s)]
*  fate for us as a country. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  Politics still works. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=510.44s)]
*  Gravity still applies. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVXQsx8RF0&t=511.88s)]
