# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 21
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU)
*  Speaking of Rudy Giuliani, there is news just tonight that thousands of his communications have been turned over to federal prosecutors in New York who are investigating Giuliani's dealings in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=0.0s)]
*  I know, I know, it's hard to keep up. All of that doesn't even cover what may have been Donald Trump's biggest loss this week. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=11.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court's refusal to block the National Archives from handing over hundreds of pages of Trump's White House records to the January 6th investigation. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=17.0s)]
*  Trump had been fighting it for months, but now those records are being delivered to the investigators. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=25.0s)]
*  And oh boy, the first document we have gotten a look at is a doozy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=30.0s)]
*  It is a draft executive order turned over from the files of a White House lawyer that would have ordered the defense secretary to seize voting machines. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=35.0s)]
*  This never issued executive order says the defense secretary must seize all the voting machines because all the voting machine companies, all of them, were infiltrated by foreign powers who changed all the vote totals and made it just seem like Trump lost. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=46.0s)]
*  Which is of course stunning. But also can I just say at the end of a week in which Republicans have been relentlessly hammering Democrats over their voting rights bill calling it a federal takeover of elections. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=61.0s)]
*  Here is evidence of Donald Trump apparently considering an actual federal takeover of elections and election machines. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=72.0s)]
*  Look, to be clear, a lot of this draft executive order is written in language that does not bear any resemblance to anything like an actual presidential executive order. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=79.0s)]
*  But Betsy Woodruff Swan at Politico points out that the opening of the document cites a number of so-called presidential authorities, including a classified document that has not previously been reported on, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=88.0s)]
*  which may suggest that someone involved in drafting the document had access to sensitive government information. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=98.0s)]
*  That said, we do not know who drafted it nor how seriously it was considered, though it has been previously reported that some proposal like this was debated in the Oval Office on December the 18th, 2020. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=104.0s)]
*  This document is dated the 16th of December. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=118.0s)]
*  But this is only the first Trump White House record we've seen that has been turned over to the January 6th investigation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=122.0s)]
*  What on earth? What else are they going to turn up? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=128.0s)]
*  Starting in June of last year, journalists at Reuters began publishing a series of hair raising reports about threats and harassment of election workers across the country. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=134.0s)]
*  They focused in particular on the state of Georgia, in large part because that was where Donald Trump's election lies were particularly focused. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=143.0s)]
*  Reuters reported in detail threats and harassment against Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, and his wife after Raffensperger refused to bow to Trump's pressure to overturn Joe Biden's win there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=151.0s)]
*  Weeks after the first Reuters report, the Justice Department announced it was launching a special task force dedicated to threats against election workers, saying, quote, a threat to any election official worker or volunteer is a threat to democracy. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=164.0s)]
*  Well, it has been almost six months since that task force was announced. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=178.0s)]
*  But today it filed its first charges. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=183.0s)]
*  A Texas man was indicted today for threatening election and government officials in Georgia. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=186.0s)]
*  The indictment does not name the officials this man threatened to kill, referring to them as officials A, B and C. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=192.0s)]
*  According to the indictment, this man posted a message to Craigslist on January the 5th last year titled, quote, Georgia Patriot, it's time to kill official A, the Chinese agent. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=198.0s)]
*  Ten thousand dollars, I guess the ten thousand dollars was what he was offering to pay to have that official killed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=209.0s)]
*  He then goes on to talk about putting bullets in three Georgia officials, calling them treasonous traitors. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=216.0s)]
*  As I said, we do not know who the election officials are that this man threatened. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=222.0s)]
*  As for the weird stuff about one Georgia election official being a Chinese agent, obviously there were all kinds of conspiracy theories being pushed by the Trump campaign about foreign countries, including China, tampering with the vote count. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=226.0s)]
*  But I will also mention that just a few days before this threat was posted, then President Trump accused Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of hiding all the supposed election fraud because his brother worked for China. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=239.0s)]
*  A conspiracy theory that managed to gain traction, despite the fact that not only did Brad Raffensperger not have a brother who worked for China, Brad Raffensperger does not have a brother. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=251.0s)]
*  So this guy in Texas has been charged for these threats. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=263.0s)]
*  The first case from this Justice Department task force to combat threats against election workers. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=266.0s)]
*  It's a start, but you know, it's strangely fitting that the first charge for threatening elections officials should come out of Georgia. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=271.0s)]
*  Georgia really has been ground zero for harassment of election workers because it's been ground zero for Donald Trump's campaign to overturn the 2020 election and undermine the administration of elections for the next time around. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=279.0s)]
*  I mean, this guy in Texas didn't wake up one morning and decide he would randomly threaten to kill elections officials in Georgia. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=292.0s)]
*  Sorry, he did not think of it on his own. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=299.0s)]
*  A pressure campaign against elections officials has consequences, consequences that were warned about all the way back in December 2020 by Georgia's top elections administrator, a Republican. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=302.0s)]
*  You may remember this moment. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=314.0s)]
*  I'm going to do my best to keep it together. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=317.0s)]
*  Because. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=321.0s)]
*  It has all gone too far. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=325.0s)]
*  All of it. The straw that broke the camel's back today is in this 20 year old contractor for a voting system company just trying to do his job. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=332.0s)]
*  His family is getting harassed now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=341.0s)]
*  There's a new South there with his name on it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=343.0s)]
*  It's not right. This kid took a job. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=346.0s)]
*  He just took a job. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=350.0s)]
*  And it's just wrong. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=353.0s)]
*  I can't begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this and every American, every Georgian Republican and Democrat alike should have that same level of anger. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=356.0s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=370.0s)]
*  It looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=373.0s)]
*  We're investigating. There's always a possibility. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=376.0s)]
*  I get it. You have the rights to go through the courts. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=378.0s)]
*  What you don't have the ability to do and you need to step up and say this is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=380.0s)]
*  Someone's going to get hurt. Someone's going to get shot. Someone's going to get killed. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=387.0s)]
*  And it's not right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=392.0s)]
*  It was clear all the way back in December 2020 that the campaign of pressure and harassment against elections officials by Donald Trump and his allies was producing a campaign of threats and harassment against elections officials by his supporters. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=393.0s)]
*  No one has been killed. And thank goodness. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=410.0s)]
*  But elections workers and officials in Georgia and across the country are being terrorized and are leaving their jobs in droves. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=413.0s)]
*  What I'm about to show you now is a social media post shared by a prominent conservative activist just before the 2020 election. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=420.0s)]
*  It shows Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris, all shaking hands with people purported to be family members of George Soros. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=428.0s)]
*  We bled their we blurred their faces because we don't actually know who those people are. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=438.0s)]
*  And you can see it is a pretty classic example of the anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jewish philanthropist George Soros is some kind of secret puppet master to Democratic Party politicians. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=443.0s)]
*  Quote, who is really running the Democratic Party dot dot dot the Soros family. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=453.0s)]
*  Quote, George Soros is training his family to carry on his evil legacy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=458.0s)]
*  Here is another social media post from that same conservative activist from the morning of the January 6th insurrection just before insurrectionists stormed the U.S. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=463.0s)]
*  Capitol. Quote, watch MAGA crowd today. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=472.0s)]
*  Best with right side broadcasting and then C-SPAN for what the Congress does. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=475.0s)]
*  Love MAGA people. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=479.0s)]
*  And then a little bit later on January 6th, the same conservative activists posted again, quote, God bless each of you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=481.0s)]
*  Standing up or praying. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=487.0s)]
*  They might say, well, it's the kind of bonkers conspiracism that we've had to get used to from the online pro-Trump right in recent years. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=489.0s)]
*  It's the kind of thing that might have been posted by, I don't know, Mike Flynn or the Mike Pillow guy or maybe the QAnon shaman. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=497.0s)]
*  It wasn't it wasn't any of those people. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=504.0s)]
*  All of that MAGA world nonsense was posted by Ginny Thomas, the wife of sitting Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for decades. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=508.0s)]
*  Now, even before her husband was on the Supreme Court, Ginny Thomas has been active in the fringier parts of the conservative movement during the Trump era. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=517.0s)]
*  She ratcheted it up a notch, promoting conspiracy theories about leftist coups, mocking victims of school shootings and, of course, making baseless claims about Democrats stealing elections. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=526.0s)]
*  Now, you might be saying to yourself, so what? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=538.0s)]
*  Sure, that all sounds nutty, but lots of people post strange things on social media. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=540.0s)]
*  Doesn't mean their spouse is necessarily endorse or believe those things as well. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=544.0s)]
*  But Ginny Thomas is not just posting things on social media. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=549.0s)]
*  Last year, The Washington Post first reported that Ginny Thomas was active in an online forum for former law clerks of Clarence Thomas, where the New Yorker reports she openly fought with Thomas's former clerks about Trump's election loss alongside Trump lawyer and big lie promoter, John Eastman. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=552.0s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=568.0s)]
*  You are one of the few people in the American legal community to get the prestigious job clerking for a Supreme Court justice. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=569.0s)]
*  And the boss's wife is berating you about Trump losing the election. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=575.0s)]
*  She's also attacked the January 6th investigation and called on Republicans to retaliate against Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney for their participation in it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=580.0s)]
*  As her husband sits on the court weighing decisions about that very investigation, which is why no one should have been surprised when the Supreme Court issued its 8 to 1 ruling order against the president. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=588.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court was also the first to report that the president was not in the election. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=599.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court was the first to report that the president was not in the election. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=604.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court was the first to report that the president was not in the election. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=609.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court was the first to report that the president was not in the election. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=614.0s)]
*  And what, if anything, can be done about it here? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=619.0s)]
*  Joining us now is New Yorker Chief Washington correspondent Jane Mayer, who has a must read new piece on Ginny Thomas at the New Yorker titled Is Ginny Thomas a threat to the Supreme Court? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=622.0s)]
*  Thank you for being here, Jane. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=633.0s)]
*  In your fascinating piece. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=635.0s)]
*  It's a stunning piece. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=636.0s)]
*  You can read it in the New Yorker. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=638.0s)]
*  You can read it in the New Yorker. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=640.0s)]
*  You can read it in the New Yorker. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=642.0s)]
*  Thank you for being here, Jane. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=644.0s)]
*  In your fascinating piece. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=646.0s)]
*  It's a stunning piece. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=647.0s)]
*  You quote a law professor, an expert on legal ethics, who says the appearance created by Clarence and Ginny Thomas is awful. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=649.0s)]
*  They look like a mom and pop political hack group where she does the political stuff and he does the judging. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=656.0s)]
*  Now, a lot of you at home might say, yeah, she's awful. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=662.0s)]
*  She says crazy things, but a husband shouldn't be held responsible for his wife's views and a wife shouldn't have to stop her activism because of her husband's job. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=665.0s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=672.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I understand the argument and I certainly don't think that wives should be unable to have separate careers from their husbands. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=673.0s)]
*  But there's something else going on here that's really important. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=683.0s)]
*  And it's what really struck me when I was doing this reporting, which was that she is involved in substantial ways in leadership roles with groups and activists who have business in front of her husband's court. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=686.0s)]
*  She's not just taking a separate role and. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=699.0s)]
*  I think we just lost Jane Mayer there in the middle of a very interesting answer about Ginny Thomas. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=703.0s)]
*  We're going to see if we can get her back. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=710.0s)]
*  We were just speaking with the New Yorker's chief Washington correspondent, Jane Mayer, about her fascinating new look into the life of Ginny Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=711.0s)]
*  In that piece, she recounts all sorts of interesting moments, including from around the time of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings at that time. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=722.0s)]
*  Ginny Thomas had a private panel discussion where she told a conservative crowd the deep state is serious and it's resisting President Trump. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=729.0s)]
*  She declared twice that her adversaries were trying to kill people and drew applause by saying, may we all have guns and concealed carry to handle what's coming. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=737.0s)]
*  Charming. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=745.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Jane Mayer, who wrote that piece. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=746.0s)]
*  Jane, great to have you back. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=749.0s)]
*  We had a bit of a technical issue a moment ago. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=750.0s)]
*  You were telling us about the conflicts of interest involving some of the conservative groups that she leads or sits on the boards of and the cases that come before the courts involving those conservative groups. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=751.0s)]
*  And one of the shocking examples that stood out to me from your piece in terms of conflict is the Muslim ban decision in 2018. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=762.0s)]
*  And not just because I'm Muslim myself. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=768.0s)]
*  Clarence Thomas was one of the justices who upheld Trump's Muslim ban without revealing that Ginny was a paid consultant to one of the far right groups that had submitted their case. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=770.0s)]
*  That has submitted an amicus brief to the court in favor of the ban saying Islam needs to be confronted. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=779.0s)]
*  And he just never revealed that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=784.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=786.0s)]
*  I mean, and she was paid a lot. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=787.0s)]
*  I mean, over two years, it was, I think, two hundred and thirty four thousand dollars in order to represent Frank Gaffney's group. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=790.0s)]
*  He's the anti-Muslim activist. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=797.0s)]
*  And he submitted an amicus brief to the court on the issue. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=800.0s)]
*  And Clarence Thomas heard the case. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=806.0s)]
*  Never. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=808.0s)]
*  Nobody ever mentioned that she was being paid by one side in the case. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=809.0s)]
*  And if you look at Clarence Thomas's disclosures, you see absolutely no no evidence of this whatsoever. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=814.0s)]
*  And the only way I found it was by having to look at the the the IRS filings from the group that Frank Gaffney runs. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=821.0s)]
*  And so, I mean, it's it's it's I mean, there are rules and they do apply to almost every judge in this country that say that if your spouse has an interest in a case, you need to recuse if a reasonable person thinks that there is an image of that. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=829.0s)]
*  Of partiality. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=850.0s)]
*  If it looks like the judge might have a conflict and can't be fair, he's supposed to step down. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=852.0s)]
*  But that applies to only the lower courts, not to the Supreme Court, because it holds itself above the ethics code that applies to the rest of the judges in this country. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=858.0s)]
*  And as you point out in your piece, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh, Stephen Breyer, they've all recused themselves when friends or family have been involved in a case that's come before the court. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=870.0s)]
*  But Clarence Thomas has never recused himself for a case that involved a group linked to Ginny, his wife. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=882.0s)]
*  Were you surprised to see Clarence Thomas as the only justice to oppose releasing Trump's records to the One Six Committee just weeks after his wife was publicly attacking the One Six Committee? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=889.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think to me the issue is that it suggests that he's not judging issues fairly. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=899.0s)]
*  He may be, it raises questions at least about whether he's favoring his wife's political activism. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=910.0s)]
*  And I think that that's dangerous, as he said himself for the court. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=919.0s)]
*  You really need the country to look at that incredibly important court and to trust that it's doing its best, whatever direction it comes from ideologically, to arrive at justice and at a fair decision. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=925.0s)]
*  And I think what the problem with Ginny Thomas's activism is, it's almost impossible at this point to see all the things that she's involved with that are in front of the court and not have some questions about whether it taints his point of view. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=940.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of us have questions about what Ginny Thomas was saying on January the 6th. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=957.0s)]
*  She says she put those social media posts up before the violence kicked off. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=960.0s)]
*  But we are all wondering about what her views were on January the 6th. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=964.0s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=968.0s)]
*  What if anything can actually be done here to fix this issue? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=969.0s)]
*  Because you can't force a justice to recuse themselves. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=972.0s)]
*  You can't forcibly remove them from the court. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=976.0s)]
*  You can impeach them. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=978.0s)]
*  But it's only about, I believe, according to your piece, it's only been tried once and it didn't succeed. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=979.0s)]
*  So is there any rules that can be changed? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=983.0s)]
*  Is there anything that could be done? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=985.0s)]
*  There actually is quite a bit that can be done. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=987.0s)]
*  And there have been some efforts. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=990.0s)]
*  There have been several bills that have been proposed in Congress to try to get the court to abide by a judicial code, an ethics code like the lower courts. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=992.0s)]
*  I think it's an issue that has a certain amount of traction. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1007.0s)]
*  I think there is a lot of interest. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1012.0s)]
*  There's even some bipartisan interest in it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1014.0s)]
*  And I think there's also a good chance that after people have taken a close look at this financial issue involving Jenny Thomas, that they may close some loopholes that have to do with disclosure. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1016.0s)]
*  Because if really if a Supreme Court justice's wife can be paid an unlimited amount of money by a secret client of some sort and it's not visible, that's a problem. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1028.0s)]
*  I think that's an understatement. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1043.0s)]
*  It's certainly a problem. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1047.0s)]
*  It's a huge problem. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1048.0s)]
*  It goes to the very heart of our justice system. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1049.0s)]
*  Jane Mayer, we appreciate your reporting on this. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1051.0s)]
*  Jane Mayer is chief Washington correspondent at the New Yorker. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1053.0s)]
*  Please do check out her latest piece on Jenny Thomas. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1056.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1059.0s)]
*  We talk a lot about how we are in unprecedented political times on this show, but some aspects of our current politics are as reliable and as shameless as ever. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1060.0s)]
*  Here, for example, is a statement from Republican Iowa Congresswoman Ashley Hinson. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1071.0s)]
*  Quote, This landmark investment will be game changing for Iowans and communities along the Mississippi River. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1076.0s)]
*  She's talking about an eight hundred and twenty nine million dollar federal investment from President Biden's bipartisan infrastructure package that passed late last year, an investment that benefits her district. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1082.0s)]
*  She goes on. That's why I help lead a bipartisan group of my colleagues in urging the administration to prioritize funding for these essential upgrades. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1093.0s)]
*  There is just one problem with this statement. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1100.0s)]
*  Republican Congresswoman Ashley Hinton, you will be shocked to hear, voted against the bipartisan infrastructure package. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1102.0s)]
*  In fact, she was loudly, proudly against it. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1109.0s)]
*  This is another one of her press releases a few days after that bill passed in November. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1112.0s)]
*  It calls the bill the biggest leap towards socialism this nation has ever seen. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1116.0s)]
*  Quote, It takes the Marxist ideology that once only existed in textbooks and mix it law in the United States. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1120.0s)]
*  So which one is it, Congresswoman? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1126.0s)]
*  Is this bill Marxism come to life or a game changing investment for Iowans? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1128.0s)]
*  This week, Republican Congresswoman Kay Granger of Texas put out a statement praising a four hundred and three million dollar federal investment in her district made possible because of the bipartisan infrastructure bill. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1133.0s)]
*  She called it a great day for Fort Worth and says the investment will make Fort Worth safer and stronger. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1144.0s)]
*  And she also voted against the bill. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1150.0s)]
*  In fact, on the day it passed, Granger put out a press release calling it a so-called infrastructure bill that was radical spending on a liberal wish list. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1152.0s)]
*  Now, these members of Congress aren't the first or only examples of Republicans taking credit for stuff from the bipartisan infrastructure package they voted against. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1160.0s)]
*  Alabama Congressman Gary Palmer was in fact first. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1169.0s)]
*  He took credit for the chunk of the bill that would benefit his home state the day Biden signed it, literally 10 days after he had just voted against it. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1172.0s)]
*  And now as we start to see the projects in the bill go from lines of text to actual broken ground and construction, get ready to see a lot more of this hypocrisy. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1181.0s)]
*  And so the next time you see a congressperson taking credit for a big piece of infrastructure near you, especially if they're a Republican, it might be wise to just double check how they voted. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1192.0s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1203.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC0umzw1mXU&t=1211.0s)]
