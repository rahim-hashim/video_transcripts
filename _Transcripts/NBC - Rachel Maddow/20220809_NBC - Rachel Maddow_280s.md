# 'Yes, Democrats Can Get Things Done': Schumer Hails Recent String Of Successes
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M)
*  Let me ask you about what I just laid out very quickly, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=0.0s)]
*  about this string of accomplishments that you have managed to pull off in the United States Senate. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=4.28s)]
*  This bill, the Inflation Reduction Act that you and your colleagues were able to pass in this marathon session over the weekend, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=9.28s)]
*  it is being called the largest, most important, most significant legislation since the Affordable Care Act. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  Do you think it is that big a deal? Do you see it in those terms? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=21.56s)]
*  I do. Some have even compared it to things even earlier in the 60s. But it's huge. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=24.36s)]
*  And look, for years, decades, Congress said we were going to do something about climate change, nothing happened. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=29.4s)]
*  We were going to go after the pharmaceutical industry and lower the cost of prescription drugs, nothing happened. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=35.2s)]
*  We were going to go after wealthy corporations and individuals who didn't pay a fair share of taxes, nothing happened. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=40.24s)]
*  And now all of these things, plus 9 million jobs, plus real deficit reduction, $300 billion, is happening at once. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=45.84s)]
*  It's an amazing accomplishment. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  And particularly in light of the fact, Rachel, we have a 50-50 Senate running from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=55.36s)]
*  We get no help from the Republicans on these issues. They're intransigent. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=61.4s)]
*  So it's really something my colleagues stuck together, every one of us, because we knew we had to get something done. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=65.68s)]
*  It doesn't have everything we want. It doesn't have everything I want. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=72.6s)]
*  But if you ask the American people, are you anguishing and just concerned that we can't get it, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=76.64s)]
*  that Congress is gridlocked and can't get anything done? Well, these six weeks have brushed that away. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=83.2s)]
*  And I'll make one more comment, Rachel, about how it might affect things. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=87.92s)]
*  You know, people are now realizing that the Republican Party is becoming a mega Trump Republican Party. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=91.96s)]
*  The Dobbs decision on choice and the other Supreme Court decisions on guns and on environment, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=97.92s)]
*  the January 6 hearings, the right-wing rhetoric that comes out of almost so many mainstream or formerly mainstream Republican politicians, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=104.36s)]
*  they don't like them. But they were wondering, well, if we give the Democrats power after November, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=115.32s)]
*  you know, keep the House Democratic, increase the number of seats in the Senate, will the Democrats be able to get anything done? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=120.2s)]
*  I think the last six weeks, with all the bills you've mentioned and particularly this recent bill, answer with a resounding yes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=126.56s)]
*  Democrats can get things done in a bipartisan way when Republicans will work with us or are pressured to work with us, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=134.08s)]
*  but on our own if we have to. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  Did you learn something through this process, again, particularly on this this bill that you just were able to pass this weekend, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=143.4s)]
*  about unlocking the lock that has been Senator Manchin of West Virginia, Senator Sinema of Arizona? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=150.56s)]
*  Those two senators in particular have taken on sort of outsized roles both in the public, both in terms of public attention, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=159.92s)]
*  but also in terms of the ability to decide what legislation moves forward and what doesn't just because of their willingness to stand with Republicans [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  on some things or at least not always stand with their Democratic colleagues. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  Do you feel like you've learned more about how to work with them in ways that keep them on side with you? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=177.44s)]
*  Well, you know, the bottom line is that in a 50-50 Senate, any one senator can block things. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=182.64s)]
*  But if you you have to keep going at it and finding ways to come together in a way that affects the American people. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=188.48s)]
*  Look, Joe Manchin and I disagree on climate, but this bill will reduce this proposal when it becomes law is the most massive change [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=195.16s)]
*  in fighting global warming that we've had. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=203.48s)]
*  It will reduce the amount of carbon that goes into the atmosphere by 2030 by 40 percent. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=205.6s)]
*  Now, the original BBB was better, but 45 percent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=211.0s)]
*  So it's very close. And I'll tell you the one thing I've learned. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=213.88s)]
*  It's a lesson my dad taught me. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  My dad passed away in November, but he's still with me. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=218.16s)]
*  You know, he had to work his whole life in a junkie little exterminating business. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=222.64s)]
*  He hated it. Never complained, never resented people who got better breaks than him. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=226.56s)]
*  But he taught me one thing that if you work hard at something when you're doing the right thing [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=232.28s)]
*  and if you work hard and you persist the way he put it, God will reward you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=238.04s)]
*  You'll succeed. We had a lot of dead ends in this process, but we kept persisting and persisting and persisting. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=241.68s)]
*  And look what we've achieved. Something really, really fine. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=248.12s)]
*  So my message persist. Don't give up. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=251.04s)]
*  Try to find that common ground. Keep your principles, but make sure that you never give up. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDVJK0cd22M&t=253.68s)]
