# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Aug. 29
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY)
*  What can you tell us about what ODNI is doing right now? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=0.0s)]
*  They say they're doing a classification review [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=3.12s)]
*  and also a damage assessment about these documents [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  that were taken from the former president. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=9.72s)]
*  Can you shed any light for us on what those terms mean [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=11.84s)]
*  and what it means they're really doing? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=14.32s)]
*  Sure, and I think it's important to focus on this, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=18.2s)]
*  and I'm glad that you have, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=20.52s)]
*  because I think there has been so much discussion [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=21.64s)]
*  over the weekend and really the last three weeks [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=24.28s)]
*  about the criminal investigation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=26.88s)]
*  And just as important as that is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=29.0s)]
*  the national security threat posed by the mishandling [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=31.32s)]
*  of these highly sensitive, highly classified documents. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=35.32s)]
*  So the first thing that the director [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=38.6s)]
*  of national intelligence said in that letter to Congress [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=40.88s)]
*  that her office, the office of the director [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=43.28s)]
*  of national intelligence [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=46.2s)]
*  and the whole intelligence community would do [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=47.28s)]
*  is a classification review. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=49.58s)]
*  That means they're going to look at the documents [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=51.32s)]
*  that have been seized, the classified ones, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=53.64s)]
*  and really determine is that level of classification [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=56.04s)]
*  still the right level of classification, right? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=59.32s)]
*  Because sometimes classified information [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=62.04s)]
*  over the course of time and events in the world [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=65.04s)]
*  is not necessary to be classified anymore [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=68.36s)]
*  or it could be potentially classified at a different level. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=70.92s)]
*  And so that classification review is to make sure [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=73.8s)]
*  or just check to see what are these documents? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Are they all still, do they all still justify [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=80.08s)]
*  the classifications they have? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=82.16s)]
*  Because as your viewers will know [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=83.88s)]
*  if they looked at the redacted affidavit [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=86.84s)]
*  some of the unredacted portions [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=88.44s)]
*  explain the different classification levels of review, right? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  So from just damage to national security [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=93.76s)]
*  all the way up to exceptionally grave [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=96.2s)]
*  damage to national security. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=98.12s)]
*  Then the second thing that the intelligence community [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=100.04s)]
*  is going to do you've I think quite accurately referred to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=103.2s)]
*  as a damage assessment, which is they are going [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=105.92s)]
*  to be concerned, very concerned with figuring out [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=108.56s)]
*  to the best of their ability, you know, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=112.04s)]
*  what types of harm to national security could occur [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=114.0s)]
*  if these documents, this information [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  or the information in these documents were to fall [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  in people who are not authorized to receive them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=124.16s)]
*  That could be foreign adversaries, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  that could be foreign spies, that could be opportunists, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=128.56s)]
*  that could be criminals, et cetera. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=131.48s)]
*  So that means not only looking at the documents themselves [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=133.76s)]
*  and assessing, you know, how sensitive they are they [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  but trying to figure out who might have access [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=140.72s)]
*  who have had access to them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=143.04s)]
*  Certainly within Mar-a-Lago we know this is a place [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=144.64s)]
*  that is open to visitors. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=147.6s)]
*  There are often foreign guests there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=149.08s)]
*  We now know that these materials were stored [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=151.4s)]
*  at all different locations within the premises. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=154.04s)]
*  And we know that there have been foreign agents [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=156.52s)]
*  or foreign nationals who have gotten into Mar-a-Lago [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=160.64s)]
*  under false pretenses before. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=164.24s)]
*  So some of the things that the department has asked for [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=166.64s)]
*  are the surveillance videos from within the premises [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=169.4s)]
*  to kind of see who's coming and going, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=173.04s)]
*  who might've had access to the different spaces [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=175.72s)]
*  where these documents were found. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=178.12s)]
*  They're gonna be looking to see, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  do we have compromised confidential human sources [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=181.36s)]
*  who are in danger, potentially in danger now? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=185.32s)]
*  Do we have intelligence collection methods [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=188.5s)]
*  that are potentially at risk now? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=190.72s)]
*  Do we have foreign intelligence, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=192.8s)]
*  meaning intelligence shared with us [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=195.3s)]
*  by our foreign government allies [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  that maybe has been compromised, right? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=199.39999999999998s)]
*  All of these things are gonna be concerns. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=201.76s)]
*  Do we have critical technologies [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  that are important to our critical infrastructure, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=205.56s)]
*  our mass transportation, our communication systems, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=208.32s)]
*  our banking systems, all of these things [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  that potentially are at risk? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=213.48s)]
*  So all of that is gonna go into this damage assessment, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=215.76s)]
*  and that will be ongoing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=219.0s)]
*  It won't be something that can be finished in a week or two. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=221.0s)]
*  That's gonna be a continuing process. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=223.48s)]
*  The news today has also been dominated, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=228.04s)]
*  today and for the last couple of days, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=230.28s)]
*  has been dominated by a lot of detailed [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=232.04s)]
*  and I think kind of fuzzifying reporting [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=233.88s)]
*  about exactly what's happening to the documents [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  that the FBI took back from Mar-a-Lago [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  and what's gonna happen to those documents. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=241.72s)]
*  You might've seen these headlines all weekend long [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  about the request from Trump for a special master [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=245.28s)]
*  to review those documents, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  and a Florida judge considering the special master request, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=250.28s)]
*  and the filings today, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  including the filing from the Justice Department [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=256.0s)]
*  to that judge about the special master [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=257.72s)]
*  and what the Justice Department has looked at already [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=259.68s)]
*  and what they have. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=261.56s)]
*  I mean, for the people who are directly involved in this, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=263.04s)]
*  I'm sure all of the minutia of the ins and outs of this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=265.16s)]
*  are fascinating, but I also think it's easy to lose [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=268.6s)]
*  the forest for the trees on a legal tangent [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=271.32s)]
*  like this particular one. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=273.12s)]
*  I mean, bottom line, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=274.72s)]
*  this whole fight over the special master thing, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=275.56s)]
*  what this is, is the Trump side [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=277.28s)]
*  trying to delay the Justice Department [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=280.0s)]
*  and its ability to use the documents [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=283.16s)]
*  that they took from Mar-a-Lago [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=285.16s)]
*  as part of their ongoing criminal investigation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  So they're trying to delay it and make it more complicated. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=290.6s)]
*  On the other side, the Justice Department now has to wait [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=293.12s)]
*  to hear from this judge exactly what kinds of rules [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=295.14000000000004s)]
*  and procedures they're gonna have to follow [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=297.6s)]
*  in order to use these documents from Mar-a-Lago [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  in their ongoing criminal investigation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  And we expect that tomorrow the Justice Department [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=303.44000000000005s)]
*  will make a big, long 40-page filing to the judge [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=305.6s)]
*  hearing this dispute about why they think [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=308.92s)]
*  it should be more simple and straightforward, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  even though Trump thinks it should be slower [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=314.16s)]
*  and more complicated. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  It's basically it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  How fast and under what circumstances [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=319.32000000000005s)]
*  does the Justice Department get to use the documents [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  that they took in the search warrant [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  and executing the search warrant [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=325.6s)]
*  towards building their criminal case? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  And you can get into the weeds if you want to. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=330.72s)]
*  This can be made to seem more complicated than that, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=333.12s)]
*  but that is really what it boils down to. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=336.0s)]
*  The Trump side wants to make it more slow and complicated [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=337.8s)]
*  for prosecutors to use those materials they seized. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=339.76000000000005s)]

*  I do think it's a fairly easy to understand dispute, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=361.86s)]

*  The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=561.1800000000001s)]

*  at Mar-a-Lago needing security after his address [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=571.5s)]
*  was posted online and Trump supporters [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=573.9s)]
*  started threatening him and threatening his synagogue. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=576.18s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=578.58s)]
*  Now apparently it's the National Archives staff. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=581.18s)]
*  The National Archives. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=584.3s)]
*  I mean, talk about the case that proves the point, right? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=585.34s)]
*  I mean, if the federal government were a zoo, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=590.26s)]
*  the National Archives would be like [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=592.68s)]
*  the lop-eared bunny's exhibit. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=594.32s)]
*  You know, the baby otters, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=596.02s)]
*  the cute little vegetarian monkeys that are so small, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=597.14s)]
*  they can sit in a teaspoon. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=599.18s)]
*  I mean, it's just not possible to object violently [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=600.5s)]
*  to the National Archives on any rational basis. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=603.42s)]
*  I mean, even if you want to make the National Archives [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=608.1s)]
*  a pulse-pounding source of great excitement, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=610.78s)]
*  it's gonna cost you $100 million to make that movie [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=613.54s)]
*  and it's going to require Nicolas Cage [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=616.06s)]
*  and it's still going to be too ridiculous [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=617.9s)]
*  to take seriously even for a second. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=619.5s)]
*  But in this political environment on the right, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=624.66s)]
*  they can generate a murderous rage [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=626.5s)]
*  about the National Archives apparently, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=629.42s)]

*  intimidated, driven out of public service [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=647.54s)]
*  if they can make you. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=649.5s)]
*  It is hard to stay a democracy just at a practical level. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=651.06s)]
*  It is hard to stay a democracy [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=655.12s)]
*  when all forms of public service, large and small, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=656.82s)]

*  when it takes bravery to be a poll worker. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=671.6600000000001s)]
*  It should not take bravery to be a poll worker [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=675.22s)]
*  or a file clerk at the archives or an immunologist. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=678.58s)]
*  The threat of political violence [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=683.1s)]
*  takes normal people out of public life, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=684.82s)]
*  which puts you on a very fast track [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=687.46s)]
*  to the end of democracy at a very practical level. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=689.38s)]

*  In the event of a nuclear disaster, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=739.38s)]
*  a nuclear blast, a dirty bomb, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=741.14s)]
*  or a conventional bomb is laced with radioactive material, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=742.78s)]
*  or particularly if there is a leak or an explosion [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=745.58s)]
*  at a nuclear power plant, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=747.86s)]
*  there's a few different kinds of radioactive particles [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=750.58s)]
*  that are likely to be released. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=753.14s)]
*  Cesium and strontium are two that you might hear about [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=756.14s)]
*  in the context of radioactive fallout. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=759.66s)]
*  They're two of the really bad ones. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=762.3s)]
*  If you're exposed to radioactive strontium, for example, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=763.5s)]
*  your body essentially takes it in [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=766.14s)]
*  and treats it like it's calcium, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=767.86s)]
*  which means terrible things for your bones [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=770.14s)]
*  and your bone marrow and your blood [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=772.58s)]
*  and ultimately your risk of all kinds of cancer. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=774.26s)]
*  Strontium and other highly radioactive isotopes [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=776.82s)]
*  like cesium are just terrible, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=779.14s)]
*  but the most common isotopes associated [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=782.3000000000001s)]
*  with the nuclear power plant catastrophe [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=784.98s)]
*  are actually two different kinds of radioactive iodine. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=787.0600000000001s)]
*  And we know from our elementary school level [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=791.58s)]
*  table salt understanding of basic biology [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=795.26s)]
*  that it's the thyroid that takes up iodine in the body. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=798.62s)]
*  And that's where this matters. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=802.7s)]
*  And in the event of a radiation disaster [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=804.1800000000001s)]
*  where people are gonna be exposed to radioactive fallout, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=806.5400000000001s)]
*  one of the immediate and most common risks [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=809.0600000000001s)]
*  is that lots of people are gonna get thyroid cancer [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=811.26s)]
*  because again, one of the most common things released [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=813.7s)]
*  in radioactive fallout are a couple different kinds [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=816.1s)]
*  of radioactive iodine. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=818.5s)]
*  We breathe that in, we otherwise absorb it, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=820.98s)]
*  we take it into our thyroids. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=823.14s)]
*  And if it is radioactive iodine, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=825.02s)]
*  we're gonna get thyroid cancer because of it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=828.06s)]
*  It's a scary concept, I know. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=831.3s)]
*  Everything having to do with radiation [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=832.5s)]
*  and radiation poisoning and nuclear accidents [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=834.06s)]
*  is absolutely terrifying. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=835.9s)]
*  But even so, just a little bit of understanding is helpful [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=837.9399999999999s)]
*  because just like with table salt, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=840.74s)]
*  just a little bit of understanding is enough [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=842.6999999999999s)]
*  to get you to an understanding [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=845.02s)]
*  of this one very practical consequence. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=847.06s)]
*  Again, we need iodine in our bodies. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=851.02s)]
*  We absorb iodine in our thyroid gland. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=853.06s)]
*  But we don't do so infinitely. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=856.26s)]
*  The thyroid takes in iodine, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=859.38s)]
*  but the thyroid can only take in so much. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=860.8599999999999s)]
*  It can become saturated with iodine. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=863.0999999999999s)]
*  And once it's saturated with iodine, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=865.2199999999999s)]
*  it won't take in anymore. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=867.3399999999999s)]
*  So you see where this is going, right? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=870.3s)]
*  In the event of a radiation disaster [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=872.2199999999999s)]
*  where lots of people are gonna be exposed [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=875.06s)]
*  to radioactive fallout, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=876.7399999999999s)]
*  one of the things that you do in that circumstance [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=878.8599999999999s)]
*  is you make sure that people have iodine tablets [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=880.9399999999999s)]
*  that they can take right away [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=885.06s)]
*  before they're exposed to any fallout. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=886.62s)]
*  If you take an iodine tablet, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=888.62s)]
*  that will mean that your thyroid is saturated [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=890.42s)]
*  with healthy non-radioactive iodine. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=892.34s)]
*  That means when the radioactive iodine comes your way, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=895.26s)]
*  your thyroid will not absorb it. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=897.8199999999999s)]
*  Your thyroid is already full. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=899.66s)]
*  You will avoid getting thyroid cancer. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=901.22s)]
*  The CDC explains it this way, quote, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=904.62s)]
*  think of filling a jar with blue marbles. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=906.1s)]
*  If you then pour green marbles over the jar, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=909.18s)]
*  there won't be any room for them inside the jar. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=912.3s)]
*  They will just spill out. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=914.9s)]
*  Nobody should proactively dose themselves with iodine [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=918.42s)]
*  like this as a matter of course. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=921.9399999999999s)]
*  This is a circumstance where there is a nuclear disaster [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=923.38s)]
*  on your doorstep. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=926.5s)]
*  But if there is a nuclear disaster on your doorstep, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=927.6999999999999s)]
*  it is a good form of protection to have on hand. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=929.9399999999999s)]
*  And as of this past Friday, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=935.16s)]
*  iodine pills are now being distributed in Ukraine [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=937.26s)]
*  in the area surrounding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=940.58s)]
*  It's Europe's largest nuclear power plant. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=944.02s)]
*  And officials are now officially giving out those iodine pills [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=947.14s)]
*  to anybody who lives within a 30 mile radius [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=950.78s)]
*  of that nuclear power plant. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=952.86s)]
*  That means tens of thousands of people. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=954.14s)]
*  People there, men, women, and children are being told, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=956.58s)]
*  do not take the iodine pills preemptively, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=958.9s)]
*  but in case of an accident or a disaster, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=961.58s)]
*  in case of radiation exposure, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=964.0600000000001s)]
*  you're gonna need to take these to protect yourself. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=965.82s)]
*  And unfortunately, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=969.1800000000001s)]
*  that is a very practical concern right now. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=970.0200000000001s)]
*  James Acton is the co-director of the nuclear policy program [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=978.62s)]
*  at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=982.36s)]
*  He joins us now live. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=984.34s)]
*  Mr. Acton, I really appreciate you taking time [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=985.5600000000001s)]
*  to be here tonight. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=987.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=987.9200000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=989.1s)]
*  So Ukraine is reportedly starting a big counteroffensive [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=991.46s)]
*  against Russia. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=995.32s)]
*  There's new State Department data that shows [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=996.88s)]
*  that Russia really is running terrifying camps inside Russia [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=998.46s)]
*  to which they apparently are forcibly deporting [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1002.32s)]
*  lots of Ukrainian civilians. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1004.88s)]
*  I mean, the headlines are all very worrying. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1006.96s)]
*  There's a lot to worry about in the Russia-Ukraine war. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1009.5200000000001s)]
*  As a nuclear expert though, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1012.48s)]
*  I wanna take your temperature basically [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1014.4000000000001s)]
*  as to how worried you are [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1016.2s)]
*  that we might have a nuclear accident [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1017.44s)]
*  or a radiation disaster [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1019.3800000000001s)]
*  at this huge nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1021.1s)]
*  Well, I'm genuinely worried about that. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1024.52s)]
*  A nuclear power plant is simply not designed [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1028.72s)]
*  to be in the middle of a war zone. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1031.16s)]
*  I think people have an image of a missile [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1033.44s)]
*  hitting the core of a reactor and dispersing radiation. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1035.4s)]
*  That's very unlikely. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1038.28s)]
*  But the big problem is there's all of the cooling equipment [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1040.6s)]
*  for the plant, which is potentially exposed and vulnerable. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1043.24s)]
*  And deliberately or accidentally, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1047.62s)]
*  that could be hit in a war, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1049.2s)]
*  sparking an accident sequence [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1052.6s)]
*  that leads to a large release of radiation. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1054.12s)]
*  So the cooling equipment, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1057.34s)]
*  which again, this is a plant that makes power, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1059.1999999999998s)]
*  but the plant requires power in part [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1062.0s)]
*  to keep its cooling equipment going. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1064.48s)]
*  Can you just explain why that's such a point [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1065.9399999999998s)]
*  of vulnerability? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1068.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so the core of a reactor [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1071.08s)]
*  produces very large amounts of radioactivity. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1073.8s)]
*  That becomes very hot [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1076.04s)]
*  and that heat has to be taken somewhere. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1077.28s)]
*  And so you need to, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1080.9599999999998s)]
*  this kind of nuclear power plant, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1082.6799999999998s)]
*  you need to be cooling it actively. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1084.36s)]
*  So you have electricity connections to the outside world. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1086.84s)]
*  In the event that those fail, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1090.4799999999998s)]
*  you have emergency diesel generators on site. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1091.9599999999998s)]
*  Zaporizia is also connected to a thermal power plant, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1095.28s)]
*  something like coal or gas [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1099.1999999999998s)]
*  that's an extra source of electricity. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1100.6s)]
*  Hot water from inside the plant [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1104.7199999999998s)]
*  is basically sprayed up in the air [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1106.52s)]
*  in so-called spray ponds. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1109.08s)]
*  In fact, you can just see them there on screen right now [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1110.6s)]
*  in order to cool it before that water is recycled. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1113.52s)]
*  All of this critical equipment related to cooling [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1117.1599999999999s)]
*  is outside of the core of the plant. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1121.2s)]
*  And one can imagine, as I say, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1124.52s)]
*  an accident sequence, perhaps involving shelling [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1125.8799999999999s)]
*  and fires and firefighters being unable to get to the site. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1128.68s)]
*  That could lead to the destruction of this equipment, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1132.36s)]
*  heat buildup in the core. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1135.24s)]
*  And eventually what we saw in Fukushima [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1136.8s)]
*  was the melting of nuclear fuel [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1139.56s)]
*  and then the dispersal of radiation. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1140.8799999999999s)]
*  Briefly, Mr. Ektan, are you hopeful [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1144.04s)]
*  about the UN investigators, IAEA investigators [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1145.8s)]
*  who are arriving at the plant this week? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1149.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm very glad the UN is going in. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1152.6399999999999s)]
*  The IAEA is going in rather. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1154.6s)]
*  But we should be realistic about what they can achieve. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1156.72s)]
*  They're inspectors. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1160.6399999999999s)]
*  It's their job to report on what's going on in the plant, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1161.48s)]
*  to assess the safety and security features on the plant [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1164.56s)]
*  and to report back. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1167.56s)]
*  And they don't have a magical way of defending the plant [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1169.64s)]
*  or repairing broken equipment. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1172.6000000000001s)]
*  And so, ultimately it's up to Russia [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1174.84s)]
*  to behave responsibly, to agree to demilitarize [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1178.88s)]
*  the area around the plant. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1181.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, given the fact that Russia's already invaded [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1183.16s)]
*  in Ukraine and illegally occupied the plant, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1185.88s)]
*  I'm not optimistic that Russia is going to start behaving [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1189.24s)]
*  responsibly at this juncture. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1191.68s)]
*  The UN has been working on the plant for over a year. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQD0BkAFzY&t=1193.6000000000001s)]
