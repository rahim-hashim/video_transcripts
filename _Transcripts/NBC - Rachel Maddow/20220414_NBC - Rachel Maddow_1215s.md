# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 13
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE)
*  Russian citizens inside Russia, where Putin has made it a criminal offense to criticize his war, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=0.0s)]
*  look what they're doing now. This is inside a Russian grocery store. You can see on the shelf [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  there that's instant coffee on the top shelf there, 400 rubles, means it's about five bucks [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=10.32s)]
*  for the jar. But the description there does not say instant coffee. The description there says, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=14.96s)]
*  quote, the Russian army has bombed an art school in Mariupol. Around 400 people were inside it, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=19.92s)]
*  hiding from the shooting. That's what it says next to the price on that instant coffee. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=26.72s)]
*  Here's a display of picnic candy bars, again, in a Russian supermarket, 14 rubles. And the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=32.32s)]
*  description of that product, it says, Russian soldiers did not let 14 trucks with humanitarian [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=38.8s)]
*  cargo into the Khursan Oblast. Peaceful civilians there need food and medicine. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=44.8s)]
*  These replaced price tags in Russian supermarkets have started to turn up in the wild. We've started [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=50.24s)]
*  to see social media and reporters documenting them. But now we've got kind of a master list, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  a grid of them that have reportedly been created by a Russian feminist anti-war group that was [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=64.48s)]
*  founded the day after Russia invaded Ukraine. Again, this is a homegrown group of Russians [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  that are doing what they can to try to speak out against the war. And as you see, there's a whole [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=77.83999999999999s)]
*  bunch of these. There's like 15 of these that they've made. But you can see how under the radar [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  they are, right? They look just like the kinds of price tags you'd see on supermarket shelves. You [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  wouldn't notice unless you looked carefully. But you look carefully and, I mean, look, we translated [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=91.36s)]
*  these. This one, the price tags 20 rubles. And what's the item for sale there? It says, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=96.8s)]
*  The Russian army has destroyed over 20 medical establishments in Ukraine. Here's another one, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=102.16s)]
*  price tag zero rubles. That might stand out to you. But then what's the description here? It says, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  people I know are hiding from Russian bombings in the metro. Zero of them are Nazis. Stop the war. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=113.12s)]
*  Here's one that's listed at 4,300 rubles. This is about, I think it's roughly about 50 bucks. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  It says, stop the war. In the first three days, 4,300 Russian soldiers died. Why is this not being [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=127.6s)]
*  talked about on TV? Here's another price tag 80 rubles. The description here says, Russian [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=135.28s)]
*  war forces have destroyed 80% of the city of Mariupol. What for? I'll show you one more. This [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  one has a price tag eight rubles. It says, quote, I haven't been in touch with my sister from Ukraine [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=149.12s)]
*  for eight days. I don't know what has happened to her. Stop the war. The group that put these out, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=155.28s)]
*  implicitly encouraging Russians to print them out and put them up on supermarket shelves [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=163.52s)]
*  in that country. The group that put this out said on their telegram channel, by replacing something [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=170.4s)]
*  very routine with something alien and unnatural, we show that there is not a single place in our [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=175.04s)]
*  country that will not be affected by the war. We do not let people simply close their eyes [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=180.48s)]
*  to what is happening. Again, these are Russians. These are Russian citizens inside Russia now [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=185.36s)]
*  illegally trying to get this word out, illegally trying to sneak their stated opposition to Putin [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=192.56s)]
*  and his war into someplace, someplace in civil society, someplace in everyday life where other [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=198.96s)]
*  Russians might see it and might know that other people are against the war too. And they're being [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=205.12s)]
*  arrested for it. Yesterday, a man was arrested for replacing price tags in a supermarket, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=210.8s)]
*  reportedly with little homemade signs that said no to war. He is facing 10 years in prison, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=216.72s)]
*  according to the local press. Today, a young woman in St. Petersburg, an artist, was ordered, held in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=222.4s)]
*  prison until June. That's pre-trial detention before she'll go on trial to face 10 or potentially [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  even 15 years in prison for allegedly putting notes on price tags and a St. Petersburg [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=236.88s)]
*  supermarket notes in her case that allegedly described what Russia has bombed in Mariupol. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=242.88s)]
*  Remarkably, we have this photo of some of her friends turning up at the police station [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=250.0s)]
*  to bring her her things and to try to support her. I think they hope that this woman would be [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=255.84s)]
*  released after her closed door court hearing today. But, you know, honestly, if your friend is facing [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=259.52s)]
*  a decade in prison specifically for putting a note on a price tag, a note containing true information, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=266.64s)]
*  it takes some bravery for you to even show up at the police station to support your friend for [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=272.88s)]
*  having done that. But look, these people did it. And this was her being brought out of that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=277.2s)]
*  closed door court hearing today before they did take her off to jail. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  And then they take her away. But it's remarkable that Russians were willing to show up at the police [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=296.64s)]
*  station to show their support for her, to applaud for her, given the threat to them for being seen [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=315.2s)]
*  to support someone who said something true about Putin's war. Credit to the Wall Street [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=321.84s)]
*  Journal's reporters in Russia for their reporting on that and credit to Amnesty International as [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=327.52s)]
*  well for staying on the case of this young woman who is now looking at a decade or potentially 15 [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=332.08s)]
*  years in prison again for putting true information next to a price tag in a Russian supermarket. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=336.56s)]
*  Because what else can you do? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=343.44s)]
*  What is going to stop Putin from grinding away at Ukraine in this war for more days, more weeks, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=344.48s)]
*  maybe more months? What's going to stop him from killing thousands more, 10,000s more civilians? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=355.12s)]
*  We don't know. But we do know that some Russians are trying. It is illegal for them to speak [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  against the war. It's illegal for the Russian media to even describe it as a war. But Russians [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=369.36s)]
*  are still trying and they're being arrested for it. But they're still trying. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  Today, the prime minister in Finland said she expects a decision to be made in her country [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=383.12s)]
*  about asking to join NATO, quote, within weeks, not within months. Her government presented its [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=387.04s)]
*  security review of the issue to their parliament today. Their parliament is expected to vote soon [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=393.2s)]
*  to make the NATO ask. I mean, bottom line here, if Putin started this war to try to push NATO back [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=398.08s)]
*  from Russia's borders, he is accomplishing exactly the opposite. He's going to have a lot [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  more NATO on the borders when this is all over. Unless, of course, we decide to screw things up. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  The other NATO countries actually have to vote to allow any new members to join the alliance. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=415.68s)]
*  Aaron Blake writes in The Washington Post today about the possibility that the country [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=421.2s)]
*  that is perhaps most likely to block that possibility might be us because of our [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=425.52s)]
*  Senate and the Republicans within it. Quote, joining NATO isn't just a matter of Finland [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=430.96s)]
*  and Sweden deciding to become members. It is also about whether current members would agree to this [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=436.64s)]
*  in the United States. That would require at least two thirds of the U.S. Senate to vote to ratify [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=441.04s)]
*  their membership. Exactly how that debate would go down could be quite interesting, especially in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=445.76s)]
*  light of the Republican Party's slight but significant Trump-era drift into more skepticism [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=450.4s)]
*  of NATO. And the looming unknown would be Trump himself weighing in on the process and not [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=455.52s)]
*  necessarily in favor. Mr. Blake points out, quote, that just last week, more than 30 percent of House [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=460.64s)]
*  Republicans voted against even a symbolic measure reaffirming support for NATO. I mean, on the one [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=466.32s)]
*  hand, it would be very unexpected for a NATO member like the U.S. to block new countries joining the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  alliance. On the other hand, given the parties involved and given the weird Trumpy feelings about [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=479.52s)]
*  Putin in the Republican Party now, maybe this is a real thing to worry about. Joining us now is [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=485.76s)]
*  Washington Post senior political reporter who wrote that piece for the Washington Post, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=492.79999999999995s)]
*  Aaron Blake. Mr. Blake, it's nice to see you. Thank you for making time to be here tonight. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=496.64s)]
*  Thank you. I have oversimplified this a little bit, I acknowledge. But let me just ask you [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  to correct me if I've got any of the basic points wrong here. You're basically raising the prospect [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=507.28s)]
*  that because of internal Republican Party dynamics and ideological shifts within the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=512.64s)]
*  Republican Party, particularly in the Trump era, they might not vote to let these two new countries [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=517.68s)]
*  join NATO. Look, I think the conventional wisdom is that Republicans and Congress more broadly [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=523.04s)]
*  would sign off on this on a pretty bipartisan basis. But also remember, this is something that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=530.0s)]
*  requires two thirds majorities in the Senate. This has been a consensus issue in the past. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=534.8s)]
*  In 2003, 2004, it was actually unanimous when there were seven countries joining. In 1999, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=540.4s)]
*  98, it was an overwhelming vote, 80 to 19. But that was an interesting one because while it wound [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=546.4799999999999s)]
*  up being a very significant majority in favor, there were concerns about this being provocative [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=552.8s)]
*  to Russia and those were bipartisan concerns. So I think if you overlay that on some of this shift [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=558.8s)]
*  away from NATO and away from foreign alliances and the Republican Party, you layer on top of that, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=564.08s)]
*  a president who has wrecked shop in NATO to some degree has called into question that alliance. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=569.2s)]
*  And according to his own advisors considered pulling out of it in a second term, I think there [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=574.64s)]
*  really is a law of unintended consequences when it comes to how this might play out, even if that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  might not ultimately mean that this is in any real danger of failing in the US Senate. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  It was interesting and I think it was important that you noted that just last week there was that [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=590.88s)]
*  vote again, a symbolic resolution expressing support for NATO, where we had 30% of the House [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=595.6s)]
*  Republican caucus vote no on that, even though it wasn't binding, even though it wasn't going to [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=602.4s)]
*  actually effectuate anything in the real world, simply to show us effectively the spirit of the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=607.44s)]
*  United States in supporting this alliance when it's under as they stand united against the, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=611.76s)]
*  the Russian invasion. Did you hear around that vote new arguments or new rationale from Republicans [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=618.88s)]
*  in terms of why they might not stand with NATO even for a vote like that? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=628.16s)]
*  Well, a lot of it, there weren't a whole lot of explanations that came out. You did see some of [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=633.28s)]
*  the more long established NATO critics basically saying that they don't like the idea of being too [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  beholden to this alliance. I think what struck me though, from some of the other reactions that I [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=645.44s)]
*  saw from more rank and file members, freedom caucus types, was the idea that this commitment [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=650.4000000000001s)]
*  shouldn't be open-ended, that this should not be something where we should be unequivocal in our [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=655.84s)]
*  continued support for NATO. And so I think that's where we start to get into these issues of, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=660.72s)]
*  if this really comes to a head, if you see the leader of the Republican party, not necessarily [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=665.7600000000001s)]
*  opposing Finland and Sweden joining the alliance, but maybe casting things in a more ambivalent way [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=670.8000000000001s)]
*  like he has in the past when it comes to Ukraine joining NATO. In 2015, he was very non-committal [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=677.36s)]
*  about that. It really is a situation in which there is going to be pressure on some of these [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=682.72s)]
*  Republicans to tow that more NATO skeptical line. And it may not manifest itself as much in the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=688.88s)]
*  Senate where there's been some more independence of Trump from Senate Republicans. But I think the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=694.4s)]
*  party as a whole would be forced into some kind of uncomfortable conversations if their leader [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=699.2s)]
*  isn't going to come on board and endorse this kind of thing. And I think that's very much an open [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=703.84s)]
*  question. Yeah. If their leader isn't going to come on board and if he's willing to not just be [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=707.36s)]
*  NATO skeptical, but to be pro-Putin in his analysis of it, as he has been in the past, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=712.72s)]
*  hopefully there's a higher political cost for that now. But we'll know when we get there. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=717.36s)]
*  Erin Blake, Senior Political Reporter for The Washington Post, appreciate your analysis, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=721.76s)]
*  appreciate your time here tonight. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=725.12s)]
*  Tonight, this joint security alert has been issued by the FBI, the NSA, National Security Agency, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=729.6s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy. This is a big urgent joint [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=735.6s)]
*  security alert just released tonight. And it's a technical alert. So I'm not going to quote from it [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  too much directly because it's all this technical stuff. But the AP, I thought, summed it up well. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=746.8000000000001s)]
*  They described this alert as, quote, warning of the discovery of malicious cyber tools [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=751.2s)]
*  that the agency said are capable of gaining full system access to multiple industrial control [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=756.8000000000001s)]
*  systems here in the United States and in North America. In other words, the US government tonight [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=763.6s)]
*  is urgently warning that someone, they're not saying who, but presumably Russia, has deployed [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=769.76s)]
*  malicious weapons that could shut down US infrastructure. Specifically, they say this [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=777.52s)]
*  thing is targeted at energy infrastructure in North America. To get more specific than that, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=781.84s)]
*  it is reportedly targeted at liquefied natural gas facilities and our electrical grids. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  One security company, Mandiant, says we should understand the threat this way, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=793.84s)]
*  telling the AP that this malware could be used to shut down critical machinery, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=797.84s)]
*  sabotage industrial processes, and disable safety controllers, leading to physical [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  destruction of machinery that could lead to the loss of human lives. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=806.72s)]
*  Cybersecurity Nicole Perlroth, veteran cybersecurity reporter, Nicole Perlroth, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  who we have turned to multiple times on this show to explain things to us in plain English [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=818.4s)]
*  that those of us without a tech background might otherwise not get. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=822.96s)]
*  When this alert came out tonight, she put an even finer point on it that kind of puts a shiver down [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=827.28s)]
*  your spine. She linked to this new joint alert from the US government tonight and she said this, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=832.32s)]
*  quote, here we go. New unnamed state hackers are infecting US critical infrastructure, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=838.32s)]
*  like electrical grid operators, with custom tools capable of worst-case scenario attacks. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=845.36s)]
*  There is no soft-pedaling it, she said. This is very serious. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=851.6s)]
*  Joining us now is Nicole Perlroth, cybersecurity journalist, author. She's also now an [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=857.7600000000001s)]
*  advisor to CISA, to US Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency, which is [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=862.0s)]
*  housed at Homeland Security. Miss Perlroth, it's a pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=866.8s)]
*  Thanks for taking time. Thanks, Rachel. It's so good to see you. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=870.48s)]
*  And you really set this up well. You and I have had these conversations for years now about Russian [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=874.48s)]
*  potential attacks on the grid and we've seen what they've done in Ukraine. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=880.16s)]
*  And the reason you and I know that we are in a heightened threat landscape right now is because [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=883.92s)]
*  we know they've had the access. We know that they have the capabilities to shut the power down. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=890.24s)]
*  We've seen it in Ukraine. What they have not had until now is the geopolitical impetus to pull the [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=894.96s)]
*  trigger. And so there's some really interesting questions about the timing of these attacks right [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=901.44s)]
*  now. Now, I said presumably Russia when I was describing what this alert was about tonight. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=907.2s)]
*  You just mentioned Russia in summarizing it that way. There isn't anything in the actual security [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=914.88s)]
*  alert from these agencies that names Russia, correct? Why would that be? And why do you think [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=920.88s)]
*  it might be safe to assume that that is who they're talking about? Well, there's a lot going on right [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=928.64s)]
*  now. So just in Ukraine, it appears to be the GRU. This is the Russian military hackers that [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=934.16s)]
*  have taken down the Ukrainian grid twice before that have shown up here in probes, let's call them [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=940.08s)]
*  of our power systems in the past. What was reported today in this Department of Energy, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=947.2800000000001s)]
*  CISA, NSA advisory basically said that something very similar to what is happening in Ukraine [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=953.2800000000001s)]
*  is happening here, but that the tools are highly customized, which make it much harder to attribute. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=961.5200000000001s)]
*  So no one is coming out and saying that this is Russia, this is the GRU. We're still in very early [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=968.88s)]
*  days here, and it's really important to give forensic investigators the time they need to [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=974.32s)]
*  attribute these attacks. But when we have seen this level of highly customized malware before [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=979.92s)]
*  on an industrial control network or critical infrastructure network, it has always generally [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=988.56s)]
*  been Russia. The attack that comes to mind was on Petro-Rabai, a Saudi petrochemical facility a [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=995.44s)]
*  couple of years ago, where hackers using customized bespoke code that had never been seen before [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1002.24s)]
*  used that code to do something very serious, which was neutralize the safety locks [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1010.08s)]
*  at this petrochemical plant. Basically the very last thing that can stave off an explosion. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1014.8800000000001s)]
*  And it took a long time for Mandiant and others to attribute that attack back to a graduate research [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1020.96s)]
*  university near Moscow that was essentially an arm of the Kremlin. And so when you see this kind [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1028.0s)]
*  of highly customized malware, you always have to stop and let these investigations take time. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1033.8400000000001s)]
*  But given the situation we are in right now with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with sanctions, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1039.76s)]
*  I've just been saying that the more we tighten the screws on Russia, the more likely it is that at [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1047.6000000000001s)]
*  some point Putin will retaliate on the West. And one very likely method of retaliation [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1053.68s)]
*  is cyber attacks on our critical infrastructure. And Nicole, when this came out tonight, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1061.28s)]
*  and I saw you writing about it online, you linked to the report itself. And I mean, this is a [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1067.52s)]
*  public-facing document and it's, you know, you can download it from their website. It's not [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1073.52s)]
*  something that they're keeping secret or they're only giving to people who are in the know. And [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1078.56s)]
*  you, writing about it on Twitter tonight, you said, read CIS's advisory in full and do everything they [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1082.6399999999999s)]
*  say now. Who is that advisory targeted at? Who should take steps to make the kind of technical [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1088.8s)]
*  changes, very technical changes that are described in this alert in order to protect the United [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1096.8799999999999s)]
*  States from this urgent threat? Well, I think the number one thing is that this is aimed towards [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1100.96s)]
*  the technical community, right? But it's also aimed towards senior leadership at these organizations. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1106.8s)]
*  You need to empower your chief information security officer. You need to give them the money [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1111.68s)]
*  and the tools right now, more than ever, to log what is happening on their network, to hunt what [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1118.08s)]
*  is happening on their network, to flag any suspicious activity for CISA, because this is [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1124.24s)]
*  a very serious threat. These are attacks on electrical operations. They mentioned one company, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1129.76s)]
*  Schneider Electric in there, whose devices have been compromised in this attack. And those devices [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1135.92s)]
*  are used to control key aspects of the grid of manufacturing, of automation, of pipelines. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1144.32s)]
*  And so if these hackers have the ability to take over those devices, you can imagine [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1153.44s)]
*  how they could be used for nefarious purposes. But the key thing is really read the CISA advisory [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1159.92s)]
*  if you are an executive or if you are in IT leadership at any of these critical [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1165.6s)]
*  infrastructure organizations. It's really, really important. Nicole Pearlroth, cyber security [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1171.36s)]
*  journalist, author, now an advisor to CISA, the U.S. Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1177.6s)]
*  at Homeland Security. Nicole, thank you, as always, for your clarity on this. Couldn't do it without [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1182.16s)]
*  you. Really appreciate it. Thank you. And it's so good to see you back. So, thank you. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_7McTsycAE&t=1187.2s)]
