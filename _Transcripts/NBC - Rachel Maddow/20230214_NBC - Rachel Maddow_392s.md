# First step to authoritarianism: attack the free press
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM)
*  As we reported here just a couple of weeks ago, Putin has just put his foot on the neck [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=0.0s)]
*  of one of the last remaining Russian language news organizations, an independent news organization [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=6.72s)]
*  called Medusa. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=11.88s)]
*  Medusa wasn't even able to operate inside Russia at all. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=12.88s)]
*  They're based outside Russia, but they cover Russia and they publish in the Russian language. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=16.4s)]
*  Putin has just declared that even though they are not in Russia, Medusa is not allowed inside [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=21.52s)]
*  Russia anymore. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=28.4s)]
*  And beyond that, he's declared them to be effectively almost like a terrorist organization, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=29.84s)]
*  at least a criminal enterprise. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=35.4s)]
*  Putin has legally branded the news organization Medusa an undesirable organization, which [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=37.12s)]
*  means anyone in Russia who reads anything from Medusa or shares it online or gives them [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=42.42s)]
*  money, subscribes to them, donates, even anybody who gives an interview to a Medusa reporter [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=47.84s)]
*  for their reporting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  They could be arrested for that too. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=54.92s)]
*  That could be seen as a criminal act. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  And as we reported here a couple of weeks ago, the Medusa staff is defiant. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=59.88s)]
*  They're scared, but defiant. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=63.2s)]
*  Their staff put out a statement in response to this action by Putin saying, quote, we'd [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=65.08s)]
*  like to tell you that our new undesirable status doesn't worry us that it means nothing, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=69.44s)]
*  but that would be untrue. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=73.88s)]
*  We are afraid. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=75.12s)]
*  We fear for our readers and for those who have collaborated with Medusa for many years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=76.94s)]
*  And our friends. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=82.32s)]
*  We believe in what we do. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  We believe in freedom of speech. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  We believe in a democratic Russia. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  The stronger the pressure, the tougher we will resist it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=88.77999999999999s)]
*  That was two weeks ago. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  And indeed tonight, two weeks hence, two weeks after we first brought you that report, Medusa [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  is still there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=101.28s)]
*  They still exist. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=102.28s)]
*  I mean, tonight you can look at them online, Medusa.io. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=103.28s)]
*  They offer English language translations of their reporting. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=108.28s)]
*  Here they are tonight online publishing independent accounts of the death toll of Russian soldiers [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=110.72s)]
*  in Ukraine, which of course is something you will never get from Russian state media. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  Here's something they posted earlier today, an account of a report on Putin being too [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=120.92s)]
*  afraid now to travel by air. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=126.14s)]
*  He is now reportedly only traveling by heavily armored train. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=128.32s)]
*  Traveling by train instead of by plane means that nobody can monitor his flight data. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=134.12s)]
*  They also have reportedly painted this train so that it's a stealth operation. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=138.6s)]
*  It now looks just like a regular Russian railways train, except you can tell it's the special [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=144.32s)]
*  Putin train because it has two extra axles to deal with all the extra weight because [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=149.24s)]
*  it is heavily armored. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=154.16s)]
*  And also all the other trains have to move and get out of its way because it doesn't [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=155.88s)]
*  stop at any stations. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  You can find that report tonight at Medusa.io. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=160.88s)]
*  Medusa is still there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=164.64s)]
*  They are still working, still piecing it together under threat. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=165.92s)]
*  As every single independent news organization in Russia has now been shut down or criminalized [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  or forced out of that country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=176.0s)]
*  And this is the authoritarian playbook, right? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this isn't just Russia. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=181.27999999999997s)]
*  This is authoritarianism. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=183.77999999999997s)]
*  You can't have total dictatorial control of a country as long as that country still has, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  an independent source of fact or information or perspective or God forbid, scrutiny or [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=192.4s)]
*  criticism of the dear leader. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=196.28s)]
*  If you're going to have unitary control of a country, you must get rid of the free press. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=199.36s)]
*  It is a systematic thing for authoritarians and it is the same for authoritarians everywhere. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=206.44s)]
*  I mean, you might remember a couple of years ago, remember the Nobel Peace Prize a couple [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=211.24s)]
*  years ago? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=214.68s)]
*  Went to two people who didn't know each other, even though they do the same type of work [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=215.68s)]
*  in two different parts of the world. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=220.84s)]
*  It went to an editor from Russia, the man on the right, and an editor from the Philippines, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=221.96s)]
*  the one on the left. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=226.12s)]
*  These two shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=227.56s)]
*  Well, by the following year, by 2022 in the Philippines, her news organization was ordered [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=230.4s)]
*  shut down by the Duterte administration. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=236.4s)]
*  It was ordered shut down in June. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  By July, she personally was sentenced to prison in the Philippines. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=241.56s)]
*  The action was even quicker in Russia. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=246.46s)]
*  Again, this is the editor of the Philippines entity and that Russian entity sharing that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  Nobel Peace Prize in 2021. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=254.0s)]
*  By March 2022, his Russian news organization, Novaya Gazeta, was forced out of Russia. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=256.44s)]
*  That was in March 2022. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=264.6s)]
*  In April 2022, he was attacked physically on a train. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=266.64s)]
*  The US government said it was the work of Russian intelligence. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=273.2s)]
*  Dmitry Muratov then put his Nobel Peace Prize medal up for auction with the proceeds to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=277.28s)]
*  benefit Ukrainian refugees from the war. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  He raised over a hundred million dollars doing that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=285.4s)]
*  But attacking the press, attacking any source of information, of expertise, authority, anything [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  that can rationally offer an authoritative, credible perspective other than that of the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  dear leader. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=305.8s)]
*  You got to get rid of that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=308.0s)]
*  That's the playbook. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=309.0s)]
*  And I think it's much easier for us to see this far away than it is for us to see it [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  close up. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=314.24s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=315.24s)]
*  Particularly when you can see it happening not just in one other country. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=316.24s)]
*  You can see it happening basically the same way in a whole bunch of different countries [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=319.2s)]
*  where the only thing those countries have in common is that they have authoritarian [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=323.12s)]
*  leaders. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=326.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=327.16s)]
*  So you see attacks on the press in Russia under their authoritarian leader, and you [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=328.16s)]
*  see attacks on the press in the Philippines under their authoritarian leader. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  You also see it in Hungary under their authoritarian leader. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=334.96s)]
*  In Hungary, the way their leader Viktor Orban did it was he got his party and oligarchs [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=339.32s)]
*  and loyalists close to him to just forcibly take over ownership of about 80 percent of [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=345.08s)]
*  the media, 80 percent of the entire media landscape in the nation of Hungary. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  Then the remaining 20 percent, the remaining independent press that they didn't outright [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=357.88s)]
*  own, they started just arbitrarily revoking the licenses of those entities to operate. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=362.68s)]
*  Calling them what else? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=369.68s)]
*  Fake news. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zZxaP33RmM&t=370.68s)]
