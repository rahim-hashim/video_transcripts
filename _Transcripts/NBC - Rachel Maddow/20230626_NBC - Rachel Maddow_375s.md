# How a 'sad sack nutball' ended up at the center of the Russia crisis
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U)
*  So the fighter jet forces this passenger airplane down. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=0.0s)]
*  It lands at Minsk. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=4.8s)]
*  Nobody knows why. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=5.96s)]
*  But once they're on the ground, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Belarusian police storm the plane and grab a guy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=8.72s)]
*  A 26-year-old blogger. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=13.56s)]
*  He was the editor of a telegram channel [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=15.36s)]
*  that was critical of Belarus's dictator [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=17.96s)]
*  and was supportive of the protests [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=21.0s)]
*  that had sprung up in that country the previous year, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  in 2020, after Belarus's dictator [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=26.7s)]
*  really did appear to have lost an election, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=29.62s)]
*  but he decided he was gonna stay in power anyway. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=31.94s)]
*  I mean, it's an amazing thing, right? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=35.94s)]
*  In modern day Europe, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=37.5s)]
*  this dictator used a MiG fighter jet [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=38.86s)]
*  to force down a European commercial flight [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=42.18s)]
*  that wasn't even supposed to be landing in his country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=45.92s)]
*  He forced that plane down into his country, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=48.1s)]
*  specifically to get this kid off the plane [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=51.06s)]
*  so he could throw him in prison. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=53.0s)]
*  The Belarusian dictator did that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=56.58s)]
*  His name is Alexander Lukashenko. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=60.42s)]
*  And even if you've never heard of Lukashenko, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=61.74s)]
*  even if you have never in your life [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=63.78s)]
*  given one thought to the country called Belarus, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=65.22s)]
*  I swear he is exactly what you are imagining [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=68.34s)]
*  when you think to yourself, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=72.86s)]
*  what does a Belarusian dictator look like? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=74.82s)]
*  Just imagine, right? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=77.5s)]
*  Look, magic. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=79.58s)]
*  Exactly that guy, right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  Giant, comically oversized military hat. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=83.46000000000001s)]
*  Regulation size and shape, Saddam style dictator mustache. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=88.12s)]
*  He likes to be seen holding guns of all shapes and sizes, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=93.12s)]
*  just randomly and for no reason, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  makes him feel like a big man, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  almost as big as when he wears the big hat. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=100.72s)]
*  During the nationwide protests against him in 2020, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=104.16s)]
*  after he stole that election, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=107.4s)]
*  he put on fake military gear, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  the kind of generic like Amazon Prime branded stuff [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  that gets called tactical because it has extra snaps. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=115.96s)]
*  He put on this little fake military suit [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  and walked around to try to get tough guy points [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  against the women and students [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=126.88s)]
*  who were protesting against his dictatorship in 2020. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=128.4s)]
*  Alexander Lukashenko is technically [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=132.84s)]
*  the elected president of Belarus, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=135.28s)]
*  but he was elected in 1994. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  And he's been there ever since. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=141.6s)]
*  He's the longest serving dictator, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean president in Europe. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=144.84s)]
*  And it's not because he keeps getting reelected [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=146.48s)]
*  in free and fair elections. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=148.84s)]
*  And forgive me for saying it this way, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=152.56s)]
*  but as dictators go, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=154.88s)]
*  Alexander Lukashenko is kind of a sad sack nutball. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  He is as weak as he is brutal, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=162.84s)]
*  which is a bad pairing that goes together all too often. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=165.16s)]
*  For Lukashenko, the main hallmark [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  of the later stages of his reign [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  as the longest standing dictator in Europe [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=174.32s)]
*  is not just that he kills and oppresses his own people [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  and aggregates all the wealth and potential of his country [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=180.16s)]
*  to himself and his family. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=183.2s)]
*  It's that he's bowing and scraping subservient [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=186.0s)]
*  to Vladimir Putin and Russia. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=190.6s)]
*  He is as brutal as he is weak. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=194.04s)]
*  But the relationship between Lukashenko and Putin [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  has led to some real weirdness, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=202.6s)]
*  especially in recent months, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  especially after those protests [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=206.2s)]
*  that could have toppled Lukashenko, but they didn't, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=208.28s)]
*  especially after Putin sent in forces [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  to reinforce Lukashenko against the people [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  protesting against him in his own country. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=216.18s)]
*  Since then, Lukashenko and Putin [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=219.26s)]
*  appear to have been trying to create [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=220.9s)]
*  some kind of super state of their two countries, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=222.34s)]
*  one in which Belarus is sort of more or less willingly [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=225.84s)]
*  subsumed into Russia. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=229.24s)]
*  This has led, just within the past couple of weeks, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=232.4s)]
*  to Russia moving nuclear weapons into Belarus. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, that's a big deal. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=239.08s)]
*  I mean, when the USSR dissolved in 1991, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=240.36s)]
*  all the former Soviet states, except for Russia itself, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=243.36s)]
*  gave up their nuclear weapons. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=246.0s)]
*  This very recent, this month, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=247.84s)]
*  transfer of nuclear weapons from Russia into Belarus, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=249.8s)]
*  that's the first time Russia's moved nuclear weapons [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=253.0s)]
*  outside its borders since the USSR collapsed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=255.16s)]
*  And it's not like Lukashenko is like a real stable genius [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=259.14s)]
*  in terms of feeling comfortable [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  that he's now in control of these things. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=264.9s)]
*  On the occasion of receiving these nuclear weapons, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=266.74s)]
*  what did Lukashenko do? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=270.38s)]
*  Well, he gave a bizarre statement to the press, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=272.06s)]
*  in which he said, if any other country wants to join [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=275.09999999999997s)]
*  in this new union he's making with Putin, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=279.26s)]
*  they should just call him up. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=282.14s)]
*  He said, I'm not speaking for Putin here, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=283.46s)]
*  I'm just speaking for me. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=284.97999999999996s)]
*  But he says he's pretty sure they'd be happy [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=287.42s)]
*  to take anyone, any other country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=289.62s)]
*  So if you wanna bring your country into this new union [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=291.78s)]
*  with Russia and Belarus, Lukashenko says, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  in return for you joining their union, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=298.26s)]
*  he'll give your country nuclear weapons as a thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=300.65999999999997s)]
*  Again, he said he wasn't speaking for Putin, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=305.24s)]
*  but he's pretty sure Putin would go along with it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=307.3s)]
*  Anybody wants to join our club, I'll give you nukes. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=309.34s)]
*  This is within minutes of him getting nukes. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=312.53999999999996s)]
*  So I know this is not a part of the world [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=317.18s)]
*  we usually pay much attention to, right? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=319.5s)]
*  There's no big like Western news bureaus in Minsk [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=320.97999999999996s)]
*  that we're all taking live shots from on Monday nights. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=323.86s)]
*  But in recent months, things have been getting [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  increasingly weird in that corner of the world [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=329.9s)]
*  under that increasingly weird, weak, unstable dictator. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=333.02s)]
*  And now, all of a sudden, that guy is the trusted authority. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=339.3s)]
*  He's the calm hand. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=343.38s)]
*  He's the man who the world is apparently entrusting [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=345.02s)]
*  with stopping a civil war [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=347.65999999999997s)]
*  in the largest country on the planet. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=349.18s)]
*  That guy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=353.06s)]
*  ["The New World"] [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7b54xVG2U&t=355.02s)]
