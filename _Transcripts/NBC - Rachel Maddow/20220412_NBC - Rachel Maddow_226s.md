# Rachel Maddow Returns From Hiatus; New Schedule Announced
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ)
*  And thanks to you at home for joining us this hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It is really nice to be back. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=2.2s)]
*  It's really, really, really nice to be back. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=3.4s)]
*  If this face does not seem familiar, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=7.0s)]
*  if you are now quite used to seeing somebody else [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=9.48s)]
*  at this hour, hello, it's nice to meet you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=12.620000000000001s)]
*  I'm Rachel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=14.72s)]
*  I have been away from the show for a few weeks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=15.56s)]
*  I took a hiatus to give myself a little reset [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=18.14s)]
*  and also to work on some other MSNBC projects [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=23.14s)]
*  that I've got cooking. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=26.18s)]
*  I gotta tell you, the hiatus has been fantastic. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=27.88s)]
*  I am really, really grateful for it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=31.68s)]
*  I know it is an unusual thing to get in this business. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=33.64s)]
*  I am very grateful to MSNBC and MSNBC's president [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=36.78s)]
*  for letting me do it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=39.92s)]
*  I'm profoundly grateful to the staff on this show [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=41.72s)]
*  for keeping everything running, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=44.24s)]
*  for doing such great work while I was gone. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=45.44s)]
*  And as Chris mentioned there, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=48.16s)]
*  I am also grateful almost beyond words [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=51.08s)]
*  for Ali Velshi in particular [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=54.36s)]
*  and for my other colleagues who filled in for me [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=56.68s)]
*  while I was away. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=58.8s)]
*  If you can't tell from the way that all the rest of us [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=61.0s)]
*  talk about him, you should know that Ali Velshi [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=63.36s)]
*  really is a prince among men. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=65.4s)]
*  He has been in Ukraine and in bordering countries [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=68.6s)]
*  for five straight weeks covering the war, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=71.04s)]
*  hosting this show, hosting his own show. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=74.48s)]
*  He's been doing just incredible work, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=76.64s)]
*  literally around the clock, all the while just being [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=78.6s)]
*  a great and generous and upstanding person [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  and a great coworker to everyone he works with [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=85.8s)]
*  while he was doing it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=88.36s)]
*  I'm telling you, you should be so lucky [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=89.48s)]
*  to ever have a coworker as great as Ali Velshi. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=91.28s)]
*  We are incredibly lucky to have him here at MSNBC [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=94.16s)]
*  and I'm really, really grateful [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=97.6s)]
*  that he helmed things so ably while I was gone. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=99.36s)]
*  I sort of feel like I have big shoes to fill coming back [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  given what a good job he's been doing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=105.8s)]
*  But I am back. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=108.44s)]
*  I said when I left before that I might eventually [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=110.12s)]
*  be taking another hiatus later on this year. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=112.64s)]
*  That things were fluid, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=116.48s)]
*  we'd be taking it one step at a time. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=117.72s)]
*  That is all still true-ish. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=119.2s)]
*  But one of the things I realized while I was on hiatus, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=121.36s)]
*  working on these other projects these past few weeks, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=126.6s)]
*  one of the things I realized to my surprise [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=129.2s)]
*  is that I actually don't really need another hiatus. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=132.12s)]
*  This one was great, but I think I only needed the one. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=135.2s)]
*  I do still have all these other irons in the fire, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=139.8s)]
*  all these other things I'm working on [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=141.84s)]
*  that I want to bring to fruition. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=143.36s)]
*  I'm working on the last, all of them take a long time [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=145.32s)]
*  and I'm still working on all of them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=147.0s)]
*  But I don't think I need another big stretch of time off. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=148.6s)]
*  So here's the plan. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=151.44s)]
*  I'm back, I'm gonna be here all this month, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  Monday through Thursday nights. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=157.04s)]
*  Now for big news events, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=160.76s)]
*  for things like the lead up to the election, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=162.0s)]
*  I will of course be here more than that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=163.44s)]
*  But that is the general plan. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  I will be here this month, Monday through Thursday nights, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=168.76s)]
*  and then starting next month, starting in May, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna be here weekly. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=175.76s)]
*  I'm gonna be here on Monday nights. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=177.2s)]
*  Again, to give myself just more time [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=179.12s)]
*  to work on some of this other stuff [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=181.64s)]
*  that I've got cooking for MSNBC and NBC. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=183.04s)]
*  So Monday to Thursday nights this month, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  starting next month, I will be here weekly. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=188.12s)]
*  And again, this might change. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=193.04s)]
*  We will see how things go. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=195.64s)]
*  But that is the plan as of now. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=197.92s)]
*  So now you know. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=199.72s)]
*  And we will never speak of it again. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=201.44s)]
*  Enough of that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=203.56s)]
*  Let's start the show. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=204.64s)]
*  We got a lot to get to tonight. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=205.52s)]
*  ["The Daily Show Theme"] [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBJx7pTkYJQ&t=206.68s)]
