# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 8 | MSNBC
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ)
*  I actually wanted to make some points on this military situation. This issue with the MiG-29s [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=0.0s)]
*  is pretty absurd. The fact that this is playing out in public is comical. Somebody should [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=7.2s)]
*  be able to pick up a phone or fly to Poland and resolve this issue and get Ukraine planes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=13.64s)]
*  Yes, this should have happened behind closed doors, obviously. But it didn't. And now we [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=19.2s)]
*  have to deal with the consequences. The consequences should not include Ukraine not getting these [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=23.76s)]
*  absolutely essential aircraft. There is a clear rationale. Ukraine needs them to defend their [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=28.88s)]
*  airspace against a violent, unprovoked attack. There isn't a real fear of escalation. Andrei [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=33.6s)]
*  Kozlov, the guest that you had on, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, wrote a really [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=42.0s)]
*  interesting and poignant thread on this, that the Russians are not suicidal. They're not interested [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=46.8s)]
*  in it. And I also need to tell you that this is an indication of really probably a deeper issue with [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=51.44s)]
*  how this war is being managed by the White House and by the Pentagon to a certain extent. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=58.24s)]
*  If this is the stuff that's playing out in public, it is not a good sign about what's going on behind [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=65.04s)]
*  closed doors. Yes, we've managed to get 17,000 missiles over to Ukraine. Those are the stingers [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=69.68s)]
*  and the anti-tank missiles. That's all true. But those are things that were already in the pipeline [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=76.8s)]
*  to a certain extent. Now we are facing new challenges, and we're just too slow to respond [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=81.76s)]
*  to this developing situation. Ukraine is not going to be defeated. It's a question of how [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=86.56s)]
*  much people they lose, really. But they have the fortitude, and now they have the missiles [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=91.76s)]
*  to defend themselves. They need more in order to avoid catastrophic civilian casualties. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=97.68s)]
*  And that's in the form of these jets. That's in the form of unmanned combat aerial vehicles. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=103.36s)]
*  And I'll tell you that these estimates that 95 percent of Russia's combat power is intact are [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=107.28s)]
*  also way off the mark. I know that we are now just adjusting our mindsets to where we are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=112.48s)]
*  and what's unfolding on the ground with the expectation that Ukraine was supposed to fold. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  But if you just do some back of the envelope math, 127 battalion tactical groups, about 70 [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=123.12s)]
*  combat vehicles, not talking about support vehicles, that's about 7,000, over 7,000 vehicles. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=128.88s)]
*  By OSINT, by people that monitor these things in the public domain, the Russians have lost [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=136.64s)]
*  more than 1,000 vehicles. That equates to much, much more than 5 percent. We just haven't caught [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  up with the reality of how things are unfolding. We have a deliberate process. A lot of this stuff [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=148.55999999999997s)]
*  is satellite imagery to assess the battle damage assessment because we're not on the ground. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  But if you look in the open source community, you actually see a much, much more telling [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=158.0s)]
*  development. And it does not look as bad for Ukraine. It's just this is a painful, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=162.4s)]
*  drawn-out war. And we could do something to help bring it to an end before it escalates. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=168.56s)]
*  And we're not doing that. All right. Here's something to understand about the unlikely rise [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=173.12s)]
*  of Volodymyr Zelensky, the comedian and actor who became Ukraine's president in 2019. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=177.44s)]
*  Zelensky ran a populist campaign against years and years of political corruption in Ukraine's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=182.8s)]
*  government. The Ukrainian people had launched two revolutions in the space of a decade trying [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=188.96s)]
*  to get themselves a leader who would not be corrupt. In 2014, they succeeded in ousting a [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=193.12s)]
*  pro-Russian autocrat after he suddenly abandoned the plan to sign a free trade agreement with [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=198.96s)]
*  the European Union and instead opted for closer ties with Russia. Now, if there's one thing the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=204.56s)]
*  Ukrainian people had been pretty clear about in recent years is that they wanted greater integration [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=210.24s)]
*  into the West, not with Russia. Ukraine has been trying to get into the European Union and into [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=214.96s)]
*  NATO for years, but has constantly been told they weren't ready. They had to crack down on corruption [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=219.68s)]
*  and strengthen the rule of law and democratic institutions. These were, in fact, all real [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  problems in Ukraine. They were prerequisites for greater formal integration with Western Europe. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=230.4s)]
*  Essentially, Ukraine had to get its act together. Only then could they join their neighbors like [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  Poland and the Baltic states in orienting themselves westward and away from Russia. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=240.72s)]
*  Now, the election of this young, charismatic populist leader elevated to office on the promise of, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=245.76s)]
*  well, finally getting Ukraine's act together, felt like a real opportunity. Now, of course, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=250.88s)]
*  Vladimir Putin didn't much like this idea. He didn't want to see Ukraine get its act together. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=256.64s)]
*  Putin preferred that Ukrainians' experience with democracy had been riddled with corruption and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=261.52s)]
*  disappointment. Plus, he saw this new Ukrainian leader as inexperienced in way over his head. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=266.32s)]
*  The guy used to be a comedian, for God's sake. A perfect opportunity to squeeze Ukraine for new [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=272.56s)]
*  concessions like ceding Crimea and eastern territories to Russia and swearing off alliances [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=278.24s)]
*  with the West. This was a moment when what Ukraine really needed was its biggest, strongest partner, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=283.68s)]
*  the United States, to step up and say that Ukraine and its new president had the full backing and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=291.2s)]
*  respect and support of the United States, that the U.S. stood with Ukraine and with Zelensky [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=296.4s)]
*  against any Russian aggression. But that's not what Ukraine's new president got. Ukraine's new [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=302.64s)]
*  president, Volodymyr Zelensky, got Donald Trump. Trump refused to invite Zelensky to the White [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=309.2s)]
*  House for a show of solidarity that the new Ukrainian leader so desperately wanted. Trump [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=315.12s)]
*  and his allies instead pushed a conspiracy theory, actually a bit of Russian disinformation, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=320.4s)]
*  that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. Not Russia, remember that? Rudy Giuliani [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=325.76s)]
*  led an effort to manufacture dirt in Ukraine on Trump's political opponents. When the American [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=332.4s)]
*  ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was perceived as a roadblock to that project, precisely [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=339.2s)]
*  because she was such a staunch opponent of the corrupt figures in Ukraine who were helping Giuliani [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=345.28s)]
*  spin up this dirt, they trashed Yovanovitch's reputation. Donald Trump ultimately removed her. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  And of course, there was the infamous phone call in which Trump made military aid to Ukraine [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=357.35999999999996s)]
*  contingent upon Zelensky doing Trump a favor, announcing investigations into Joe Biden and his [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  son. Trump froze congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine to pressure him. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=369.92s)]
*  All of this, of course, resulted in Donald Trump's first impeachment, but we tend to see Trump's [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine debacle in terms of its domestic political consequences in America. The consequences for [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  Ukraine were far more serious. What Ukraine needed was for Trump to support its new untested, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=388.16s)]
*  uncorrupt president on the world stage so he was taken seriously by his neighbors, including Russia, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=394.88s)]
*  and by his fellow citizens, so that he could be the real leader he needed to be in fending off [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=400.48s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. Instead, Donald Trump chose to try to leverage the situation for his own political [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=406.4s)]
*  gain. And for President Zelensky, having that military aid frozen, having the president of the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=412.56s)]
*  United States try to shake him down, well, that cost Zelensky in terms of power. It cost him in [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=417.68s)]
*  terms of respect. It cost him in terms of his authority against Vladimir Putin. And who can say [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=423.92s)]
*  what it might end up costing him now that he is in a war that may come down to a matter of small [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=428.8s)]
*  degrees here and there? Back then in 2019, when Zelensky called Trump, there was an opportunity [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=436.16s)]
*  for the American president to stand behind Ukraine, an opportunity to do better. Donald Trump didn't [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=443.36s)]
*  take it. Of course, one of the reasons we even know about that phone call is because a national [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=451.12s)]
*  security official named Alexander Vindman heard that call. He was listening into it live. He knew [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=455.6s)]
*  it was wrong. He reported it up his chain of command, and then he testified to the United [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=461.44s)]
*  States Congress about it in the impeachment hearing of Donald Trump. Joining us now is the retired [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=466.64s)]
*  Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. He was a Ukraine expert on the National Security Council [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=471.12s)]
*  and a witness in President Trump's first impeachment hearings. Colonel Vindman, it is an honor to have [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  you back with us. Thank you for being here. In your book titled Here Right Matters, you detailed [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=479.92s)]
*  this specific matter, the fact that you had provided, you and your cohorts in the White House [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=485.36s)]
*  and the National Security Council, had provided guidance and advice that President Trump was [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=490.32s)]
*  supposed to have read and taken to say, you need do very little for Ukraine right now. The congressional [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  aid had already been approved and was on its way to Ukraine. All you need to do is show this man's [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=500.88s)]
*  support so that he can stand up against Vladimir Putin. Donald Trump didn't do that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=505.68s)]
*  That's right. He attempted to extort an investigation into his chief rival going into the 2020 election [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=509.6s)]
*  and really undo our own electoral system and our democracy. So he's looking to harm us on that note [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=519.2s)]
*  while at the same time undermining this brand new leader, untested leader, that was facing down [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=529.28s)]
*  war with Russia, an ongoing war at that point, ongoing for five years, and attempting to avert [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=535.76s)]
*  what we see unfolding today. So that kind of support that he needed with regards to arms, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=541.92s)]
*  with regards to US support, he didn't get it. As a matter of fact, the Trump Ukraine scandal [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=547.52s)]
*  made Ukraine radioactive for the remainder of the Trump administration. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=555.3599999999999s)]
*  And it actually had a chilling effect on the Biden administration because there was the baggage of [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=558.7199999999999s)]
*  all these false accusations against Joe Biden. So the bottom line is that it was really harmful [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=564.16s)]
*  all the way through. There's a direct red line from that episode to really frankly where we are [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=570.48s)]
*  today because Vladimir Putin saw a lot of opportunity and the lack of support to Ukraine. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=576.48s)]
*  He saw a lot of opportunity in the fact that Ukraine was already radioactive and that half [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=582.24s)]
*  of our political elites, the Republican Party, was bandwagoning, cheerleading for Donald Trump [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=586.56s)]
*  and for Putin. Sorry. I ask you this not to be political because as you and I have been talking [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=592.24s)]
*  over the last week, you know that I'm on the border and I'm seeing these Ukrainians come here in the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=598.72s)]
*  freezing cold, trying to find a home, escaping terror. I just don't wish to have a political [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=603.04s)]
*  conversation. But in the end, we are seeing the Ukrainian resistance. We are seeing the efforts [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=608.24s)]
*  that the Ukrainians are going to. Whether this fails or succeeds for Ukrainians will come down [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=613.68s)]
*  to a matter of degrees. And one day we may look back at this and said, had Donald Trump done [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=619.52s)]
*  something different? Had America done something different in that moment where you wrote the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=623.68s)]
*  report, you wrote the brief that said, please just do this. The outcome might be different. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=626.96s)]
*  I think that's very true. I think it's clear to me that we were looking to avoid this major [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=634.4s)]
*  confrontation and Trump pushed us in the other direction. We were always, our policy frankly [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=640.16s)]
*  our policy frankly for two decades was soft on Russia, soft on Russian abuses towards its [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=647.44s)]
*  neighbors, towards the democracies, towards our security. But if we were soft and we were [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=653.76s)]
*  entering in that direction, the Trump administration lurches in that direction and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=659.44s)]
*  certainly undermined the security of Ukraine and the United States because this war is so large, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=663.52s)]
*  the largest country in the world fighting the largest country in Europe. That's the possibility [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=670.24s)]
*  of that saying limited is extremely low. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=675.04s)]
*  announced today that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine so far in search of safety [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=680.24s)]
*  from Russian attacks. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are still trying to make their way [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  out of the country as the fighting intensifies. So far more than 190,000 have crossed the border [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  to where I am in Hungary. Tonight I'm standing at a refugee shelter set up at a border crossing [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=695.36s)]
*  point in Hungary. It's just before 4 a.m. here. Most people are sleeping. But earlier tonight [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=700.8s)]
*  I was able to walk through a reception area where people who had recently crossed the border, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=707.1999999999999s)]
*  including families with young children, arrived for food, shelter and warmth for the night. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=711.12s)]
*  Take a look. So this is the buffet, basically the place where people who are staying here, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=715.76s)]
*  people who have come over from Ukraine can can get a little bit of food. There's an office in [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=722.64s)]
*  which they run this entire operation at the border out of. It's inside a little tent. You [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=727.52s)]
*  can see some people going in there. They get registered. Their needs are determined. Even on [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=731.6s)]
*  the wall of the buffet here you can see train lines. There are routes that indicate where we [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=737.76s)]
*  are and where you can go in Hungary or in Europe. Now when the refugees get here, there's a waiting [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=742.4s)]
*  room over here. And I don't really want to go in right now because it's quite late at night and [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=748.48s)]
*  there's children sleeping in there. But it's a warm space in which people can rest. There are [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=753.2s)]
*  beds, twin beds that are out there. There are some people who are lying across several chairs [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  that have been put together. And then over here are sort of containers that have been made into [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=763.6800000000001s)]
*  sleeping spaces. These are places where people can rest. It's clean. It's warm. It's a very cold [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=770.32s)]
*  night. It's about 26, 27 degrees right now, probably getting colder over the night. So that's [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=776.48s)]
*  what this reception center is. It's a help center. It's a reception center. It's not built for people [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=783.04s)]
*  to be staying here for any length of time, but it is meant to receive people who are coming over the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=788.16s)]
*  Hungarian border from Ukraine who then are going to go somewhere else. In some cases it's Budapest. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=792.48s)]
*  In some cases it's other points in both Eastern and Western Europe. But this is typical of the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  the help centers that are available at the crossings from Ukraine over into countries, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=803.68s)]
*  either NATO countries like Hungary or other Eastern European countries that are not NATO, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=809.5200000000001s)]
*  but that are a refuge for Ukrainians who need to get out of their country. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=814.0s)]
*  This is not a natural disaster. None of this needs to be happening. It's a tragedy whose [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=821.12s)]
*  purpose is hard to process, that human beings still cause each other this kind of suffering in 2022. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=825.44s)]
*  Now, despite the repeat calls from Ukrainian people and its leaders to enforce this no-fly [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=832.4000000000001s)]
*  zone over the country, the United States and NATO remain resistant to that idea. But one NATO ally [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=837.68s)]
*  is trying to assist Ukraine in the skies in a different way. Today Poland announced that [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=843.04s)]
*  it would be transferring its entire fleet of MiG-29 jet fighters to the U.S. Air Base in Germany, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=848.9599999999999s)]
*  with the expectation that the United States would then donate those jets to Ukraine, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=856.0s)]
*  whose fighter pilots know how to fly the Russian-made MiGs. That proposal is not only [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=860.64s)]
*  a logistical quagmire, but also runs the serious risk of triggering Russia's retaliation against [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=865.52s)]
*  the United States for assisting the Ukrainian military effort. The Defense Department threw [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=871.12s)]
*  cold water on Poland's proposal tonight, saying that it does not believe that there is a clear [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  rationale to transfer jets from a NATO country into the Ukrainian conflict and that the United [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=880.8s)]
*  States is not convinced that this plan is tenable. Today, President Biden did announce that the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=886.0s)]
*  United States would ban the import of Russian oil and natural gas into the country. The UK today said [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=892.0s)]
*  it will do the same thing by the end of the year, exporting oil and gas. Keep in mind is how Russia [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=897.92s)]
*  makes most of its money, so this is going to hit Russia where it hurts the most. Ukraine's president, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=903.76s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky, praised the move in a video released this evening. He said he's personally [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=909.12s)]
*  thankful to President Biden for making this decision that will quote quote make Russia pay [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=914.0s)]
*  for their aggression an answer for the evil that they have done. Joining us live from Ukraine is [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=919.12s)]
*  Andrei Zagorotnyuk. He's the former Ukrainian Minister of Defense as well as the Chairman of [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=925.44s)]
*  the Security Think Tank Center for Defense Strategies. Sir, thank you for being with us tonight. I have [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=931.2s)]
*  to ask you, everybody I've talked to in the government, the Ukrainian government, can't be [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=937.6s)]
*  more proud of the resistance, the civilian resistance, the territorial defense, and the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=942.88s)]
*  actions of the Ukrainian defense forces, but they have all said that Ukraine cannot withstand the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=948.32s)]
*  power of Russia without more help from the West. Now we've heard the Defense Department, the United [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=954.32s)]
*  States say this plain trade with Poland is not actually going to happen. I want to get your [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=960.24s)]
*  reaction to that first. Yeah, well we were quite welcoming of course the move of Poland and I don't [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=965.6s)]
*  understand why shouldn't it happen. If one country, sovereign nation, wants to help its neighbor, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=972.6400000000001s)]
*  and to transfer the equipment. U.S. has been transferring to us like millions of dollars, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=978.1600000000001s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment of different kinds. So why that cannot be planes? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=983.9200000000001s)]
*  To be honest, I sincerely hope, this is a relatively recent news like from tonight, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=988.96s)]
*  but I sincerely hope that the US wasn't like serious about saying that no it's not going to [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=993.9200000000001s)]
*  transfer the planes. We believe this would be considered. You know, we're going to be speaking [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=999.6s)]
*  to Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman in a moment, but he said something the other day in [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1006.64s)]
*  which he said things that were unthinkable two weeks ago are real today. Things that will be [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1011.12s)]
*  unthinkable today will be real two weeks from now. So to that degree, what is it that what kind of [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1015.04s)]
*  creative thinking can you suggest to the West, to NATO, to the United States to say look if you don't [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1021.1999999999999s)]
*  want to get into a direct fighting war with Russia, here are the other options that you might consider? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1026.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so the options were, of course, it's helping with the fighter jets and so to enhance our [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1031.2s)]
*  Air Force capability, also the transferring air defense weapons in order for us to protect our [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1038.56s)]
*  skies more and also to set up even in the limited range some sort of non-fly zone, at least in a [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1045.04s)]
*  part of the country where we could guarantee that people would feel safe because right now there is [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1051.44s)]
*  no such place in Ukraine where people feel safe and that creates possibly a much bigger problem of [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1057.12s)]
*  possibly even tens of millions of refugees. So Ukrainian armed forces are actually quite [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  successful on the ground and actually the casualties from Russia is over well over 10,000 [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1068.9599999999998s)]
*  and there are also wounded soldiers from Russian army, tens of thousands already. So actually their [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1077.28s)]
*  ground capability and their manpower capability is reducing but they still have a substantial [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1085.36s)]
*  advantage in the sky which they use over and over again as we can see in the only civilian [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1091.04s)]
*  infrastructure over again every night, every day. So that has to be addressed indeed. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1096.48s)]
*  What is the thing that you think is going to convince your Western neighbors and NATO to do [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  something? Well you just heard Richard Engel talking about the fact that a hospital has had to be [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1110.1599999999999s)]
*  evacuated. We continue to see confirmed reports of civilian casualties attacks that look like in some [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1114.72s)]
*  cases they are deliberate. Some of them are the circumstance of bombing or missiles but some of [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1120.32s)]
*  them seem to be deliberate attacks on civilians. These are war crimes if they are true. Is that the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1125.28s)]
*  thing that's going to convince the West to say look at the very least create humanitarian corridors [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1130.32s)]
*  to let our people travel or let them out? Exactly and humanitarian corridors and humanitarian zones [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1135.2s)]
*  some sort of protected areas I just said but honestly speaking there's most of these [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1142.08s)]
*  shellings are nothing to do with the war effort. They're just terrorizing civilians because [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1147.12s)]
*  they've been shelled lots of buildings which are not even close to the military objects [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1153.12s)]
*  and they are war crimes and of course we have more than enough evidence for that from all [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  different towns and villages and so on. So yes there are solutions and US diplomats and US [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1164.0s)]
*  experts and military personnel I mean DOD and so on they do know exactly what could be done. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1171.52s)]
*  So I believe it's just to forming a finally a policy about that and just to making decision [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1178.48s)]
*  because every day decision is delayed we see the more casualties that simple as that. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1183.44s)]
*  And of course we see more refugees streaming over these borders [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1191.44s)]
*  including the places like where I am. Andrei Zagorotniuk we appreciate your time. Thank you [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1194.6399999999999s)]
*  for joining us this evening. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPw1fVG07rQ&t=1199.12s)]
