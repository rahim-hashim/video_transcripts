# Cheney to Republicans: 'We have a particular duty to step up' against Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4)
*  I feel like what you describe as a cult of personality was more likely to emerge on the right than on the left. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4&t=0.0s)]
*  Because I feel like people on the right have been getting told by the Republican Party my whole adult life that government is the problem, like Ronald Reagan said, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4&t=8.0s)]
*  and we need voting restrictions because Democrats cheat, and we need unregulated guns, not just for hunting and self-defense, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4&t=18.0s)]
*  because we need to stand up against our government tyranny. And all the stuff that maybe works in the short term but in the long term builds toward radicalism, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4&t=28.0s)]
*  and I think opens the right more up to a cult of personality than the left. And I know we probably disagree on that strongly. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4&t=36.0s)]
*  I think that's, we do disagree on that. But what I would say is, the way that I look at it is those of us on the right in this moment have a particularly great responsibility and duty, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4&t=42.0s)]
*  because this threat has emerged from the right. We can talk about why that was. I think that frankly there are millions of people around the country who feel like they aren't heard. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4&t=56.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump managed to convince them that he would be their voice, which is of course a complete lie, but they bought it. And he preyed on that patriotism. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4&t=66.0s)]
*  But right now it's I think partly why I have been so disappointed with what I've seen from other members of my party in their unwillingness to step up. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4&t=76.0s)]
*  I think we have a particular duty to step up. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4&t=88.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPgPjV6uDb4&t=106.0s)]
