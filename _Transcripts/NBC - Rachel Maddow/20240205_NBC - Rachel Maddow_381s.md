# Court keeps Oregon GOP senators off ballot over constitution violation; ominous parallels for Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4)
*  In 2019, in Oregon, Republicans in the state legislature walked out over a tax bill they [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=0.0s)]
*  didn't like. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=5.92s)]
*  They left and they used their absence to deny the legislature a quorum, which brought the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=7.08s)]
*  legislature to a halt for days. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  Then a couple months later, they did it again. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=14.96s)]
*  This time it was a climate bill they objected to. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=17.36s)]
*  Several of them, in that case, fled the state. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=19.88s)]
*  When the governor of Oregon sent state police out to bring them back, one Republican senator [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=22.16s)]
*  said that the police had better, quote, send bachelors and come heavily armed, as in don't [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=27.2s)]
*  send anyone with a wife because the wives will be sad when we kill the police officers [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=34.36s)]
*  you're sending. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=38.76s)]
*  There never was an armed showdown with state troopers, but the Republicans in Oregon did [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=41.6s)]
*  succeed in killing that climate bill by using that tactic. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=45.78s)]
*  The next year they did it again. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  They walked out as a group two weeks before the end of the legislative session and they [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=50.92s)]
*  never came back. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=54.22s)]
*  That killed the climate bill again. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=55.22s)]
*  It killed 20 other pending bills that they decided just shouldn't be voted on at all. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=57.0s)]
*  Then the following year there were two more Republican walkouts, several days each. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=62.24s)]
*  Under the state constitution in Oregon, you need to have a quorum to have the legislature [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=67.6s)]
*  in session. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Two-thirds of the lawmakers have to be present to do any business. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  So when the Republicans have done these repeated walkouts, it has stopped the legislature from [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  functioning for any purpose and it's happened year after year after year. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=80.98s)]
*  So Oregon voters decided they didn't want this to happen anymore. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=86.72s)]
*  In 2022, Oregon voters voted to change the state constitution to try to fix this problem. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=89.96s)]
*  By a very wide margin, Oregon voters enacted an amendment to the state constitution that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=96.0s)]
*  says any legislator who has more than 10 unexcused absences is not allowed to run for re-election. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=100.76s)]
*  So you don't get thrown out. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  You get to finish your turn, but you can't run again. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=109.8s)]
*  Voters approved that as an amendment to the constitution in 2022. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=113.04s)]
*  And then what do you think happened in 2023? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  Not only did the Republicans and the legislature walk out again, they staged the longest legislative [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  walkout in modern US history. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=127.48s)]
*  Oregon Republicans left for six weeks. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=129.76s)]
*  They staged a boycott over Democratic legislation on abortion and other issues, but they just [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  skedaddle. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=139.86s)]
*  They got out. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=140.86s)]
*  If this tactic sounds familiar, it should. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=142.54000000000002s)]
*  Both parties have done this in various states at various times. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  Wisconsin Democrats famously did this to try to save union rights. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=148.5s)]
*  Texas Democrats famously did it to try to stop a huge power grab by Republicans in Texas. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=152.18s)]
*  Other states have done it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=158.86s)]
*  Other parties have done it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  The difference here is that there are now consequences for doing it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=161.9s)]
*  Oregon voters overwhelmingly voted to change their state's constitution to say, okay, from [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=166.26000000000002s)]
*  here forward in our state, there will be consequences for you if you do this over and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=171.42s)]
*  over again. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=175.61999999999998s)]
*  You will not be allowed to run for office again. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=176.61999999999998s)]
*  And even after voters changed the state constitution to say that, the Republicans and the legislature [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=180.66s)]
*  just kept doing it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  And so now their actions inevitably have produced consequences, very predictable consequences. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=189.22s)]
*  But they're still shocking consequences. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=197.48s)]
*  The Oregon Supreme Court has now ruled unanimously that sure enough, these Republican senators, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=199.34s)]
*  10 Republican senators are no longer legally allowed to run for reelection. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=205.18s)]
*  They plainly and deliberately violated the newly amended state constitution, so they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=210.86s)]
*  can't run again. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  And obviously this is a huge deal in that state. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=218.06s)]
*  I mean, this is almost all the Republicans. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=219.94s)]
*  This is fully a third of the state Senate that has just been ruled ineligible to run [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=227.74s)]
*  So it's a big deal there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  But also, yes, this is kind of a microcosmic version of what we're about to see on the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=232.9s)]
*  federal level at the Supreme Court Thursday of this week when the country's top court [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=239.02s)]
*  decides whether Donald Trump himself can be blocked from the ballot for violating the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  U.S. Constitution. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  In a small and microcosmic way, a very consequential way, they're doing it first in Oregon. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=249.96s)]
*  Right now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=257.92s)]
*  So how's that going? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=258.92s)]
*  Joining us now is Julia Shumway. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=259.92s)]
*  She's deputy editor at the Oregon Capital Chronicle. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=261.88000000000005s)]
*  Ms. Shumway, I really appreciate you making time to be here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=266.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=267.20000000000005s)]
*  What's been the reaction to this unanimous state Supreme Court ruling that says they [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=268.20000000000005s)]
*  can't run again? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=273.48s)]
*  There's been, I mean, it's generally been applauded by people who supported the amendment [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=274.48s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=279.40000000000003s)]
*  The Republican state senators view this as a political act by the court. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=280.88000000000005s)]
*  They noted that the court has been entire. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=286.48s)]
*  The justices who ruled on this were entirely appointed by Governor Kate Brown, who was [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=289.6s)]
*  a Democrat. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=294.36s)]
*  In terms of the fight here, obviously, the state Supreme Court decision on a matter of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=297.0s)]
*  state law and state constitutional authority, you would think that would be the end. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=301.36s)]
*  But I understand there's probably at least a fed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  There is a federal challenge that at least probably has some traction in terms of the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=309.0s)]
*  way Republicans are going to try to advance their case. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=312.36s)]
*  What's the status of their federal court challenge to this? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=314.8s)]
*  Yeah, there's a separate federal lawsuit that was filed under First Amendment claims, essentially, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  that these Republican senators have a right to protest and their right to protest was [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=323.24s)]
*  being curtailed. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  A judge denied a preliminary injunction in that case in December. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  We're waiting to see and waiting on a ruling from the Court of Appeals, the Ninth Circuit [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=332.8s)]
*  Court of Appeals on an appeal to that ahead of the March 12th filing deadline here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=338.6s)]
*  While the country is considering this disqualification issue for President Trump at the Supreme Court, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=345.04s)]
*  to have Oregon going through this exercise is a really remarkable confluence of events. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=349.68s)]
*  Julia Shumway, deputy editor at the Oregon Capital Chronicle, thanks for helping us [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  understand. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p84ua4id_d4&t=374.72s)]
