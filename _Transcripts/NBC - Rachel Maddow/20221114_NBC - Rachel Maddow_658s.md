# Schumer Looking To 'Get Things Done' As Senate Majority Leadership Is Extended
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow)
*  Joining us now live is Senator Chuck Schumer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for making time to be here tonight, sir, and congratulations. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, R-TX, MN, CHR. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=6.8s)]
*  It was good at that restaurant. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=7.76s)]
*  You know, people got on their emails that we had won, and the whole restaurant [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  broke out in cheers. It was just wonderful. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=15.6s)]
*  It was a great moment. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=15.76s)]
*  That's a lot different. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=16.8s)]
*  I hope you left a big tip. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. I'm a big tipper. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=21.04s)]
*  So let me get your response tonight to this new news that we've just had within the last half [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  an hour or so, 45 minutes out of Arizona. NBC News is now projecting that the Democratic [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=29.6s)]
*  candidate Katie Hobbs has defeated Republican Kerry Lake in that state. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's first great news, obviously. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  Kerry Lake was a very dangerous person. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=41.2s)]
*  She's very smooth talking, but very, very dangerous and had hard right views. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=43.44s)]
*  And if she is defeated in a state like Arizona, which is a purple state, it should send [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=48.96s)]
*  another message, another shockwave through the Republican Party that when you embrace [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=54.08s)]
*  this MAGA Republican right-wing extremism, you lose. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=58.88s)]
*  Candidate after candidate had lost, who just about every one of the extreme people wanted [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=62.96s)]
*  to undo the next election, denied this election, all lost. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=70.08s)]
*  And as I've said, I hope this is a lesson to the mainstream Republicans. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=74.16s)]
*  Now, we don't agree with the mainstream Republicans on so many different things, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=78.64s)]
*  but I hope it's a lesson to them that if they embrace this MAGA Republican Trumpism, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=82.48s)]
*  they're going to lose. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=89.12s)]
*  The American people, this is one great thing, Rachel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=90.16s)]
*  A lot of people doubted the fidelity of democracy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=93.04s)]
*  And with reason, we saw the election deniers. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  When you're a political party that denies an election, that's the beginning of autocracy, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=99.76s)]
*  the end of democracy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=105.04s)]
*  So they saw these election deniers. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=106.56s)]
*  They saw the violence on January 6th. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=108.56s)]
*  They saw much other threats, threats of violence, even against innocent poll workers who were [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=110.64s)]
*  just trying to do their job. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=115.44s)]
*  And they said democracy's eroding. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=116.88s)]
*  But on democracy's roots, they may be quiet, but they run deep. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=119.92s)]
*  And the American people, not just liberal Democrats, but moderates and even conservatives [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=124.56s)]
*  said this MAGA Republican Party is against everything that democracy is all about. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=128.88s)]
*  I can't vote for them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=133.84s)]
*  And I predicted this in August. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=135.2s)]
*  I said there was going to be about 10% to 15% of the electorate who normally might vote [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=136.8s)]
*  Republican who is going to not vote for them because of this embrace of MAGA. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=142.64s)]
*  So my hope, my plea really to the non-MAGA Republicans in the Senate is work with us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=146.8s)]
*  We will be willing to compromise because the main one of the, the second reason we were on one is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  we got real things done. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=158.72s)]
*  We took on big oil and got the biggest climate bill ever done. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=160.48s)]
*  We took on pharma and finally put a limit on prescription drug prices. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=164.48s)]
*  We took on the NRA and actually passed some good gun legislation. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  The people saw two things. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  They saw us fighting for things they cared about and succeeding. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  And they saw the Republicans at the MAGA extreme. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  And they put those two things together with the fine candidates we ran who were very decent, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=181.04s)]
*  honorable, and very successful, effective people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  And that clinched the election for us. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=190.16s)]
*  This will happen again if the Republicans continue to embrace MAGA. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=193.2s)]
*  So the warning, the clarion call to the non-MAGA Republicans is work with us. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  And people say, well, they won't. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=203.28s)]
*  Well, one other point of the six major bills we passed in June and July and August, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=205.04s)]
*  which woke America up that we could do things, five were bipartisan. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  The big one, IRA was not because Republicans wouldn't do anything on climate, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  wouldn't go after pharma. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  But things like the gun bill, the chips bill, which brought American jobs back here and said, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=219.2s)]
*  we're not going to let China take over our or any other country, take over our chip fab industry. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=225.2s)]
*  The bill that said the Veterans Administration had to deal with those veterans who were exposed [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=231.2s)]
*  to the burn pits. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=235.6s)]
*  All of those and many other things passed in a bipartisan way. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=236.56s)]
*  And so I'm hopeful and I'm an optimist. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=239.76s)]
*  You know me well, but they're going to do that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=242.88s)]
*  They're going to say that path doesn't work. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  We don't need every Republican to do it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=246.72s)]
*  We don't even need half. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=248.32s)]
*  We just need a group that we can work with. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=249.28s)]
*  And we're willing to meet them part of the way. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=251.68s)]
*  I'm not going to give up our principles, but meet them part of the way to get more things done for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  the American people. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, let me ask about one of these that's going to come up fairly quick. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=259.04s)]
*  I understand that you today filed cloture on a bill to codify marriage equality, to make it [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=263.12s)]
*  federal law that same sex couples have the right to marry. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=268.8s)]
*  I mean, clearly you are worried that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court is going to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=272.96s)]
*  basically coming for people's marriages and they're going to try to take away that right. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=278.8s)]
*  What is your expectation in terms of a moving cloture on this today? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  There will be the first votes on Wednesday. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  Are you expecting Republicans to join Democrats in supporting this? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=288.24s)]
*  Our two lead Republicans on this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=292.32s)]
*  I asked two people to be our leaders on this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=294.24s)]
*  Tammy Baldwin and Kirsten Sinema. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=296.64s)]
*  And they came back when it first came that the Republican in the House, 30 Republicans [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=298.96s)]
*  voted for marriage equality, much to our surprise and delight. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=304.08s)]
*  Put it right on the floor. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=307.36s)]
*  Some people said, well, Sinema and Baldwin are leads on this said to us, we're not going [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=308.32s)]
*  to get the votes if you do it now, but we're quite certain that if you do it after the election, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  we will get it done. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, my job is to get things done, get things done. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=320.24s)]
*  I know that some people said just make it an issue, show where the Republicans are, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  but the American people and particularly LGBTQ plus people who want the right to marry. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=327.68s)]
*  And by the way, it's sort of personal to me. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=332.8s)]
*  I have a daughter who has a beautiful wife and they're expecting a baby in a few months. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=335.12s)]
*  Isn't that great? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=339.84s)]
*  People want us to get things done. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=343.36s)]
*  People want us to get things done. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=345.12s)]
*  And I'm optimistic based on what I know and what our two lead senators know that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  we will get the votes to get this done. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  And it'll be it'll say to that Supreme Court, just like we want to say to them, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=355.6s)]
*  get your hands off women's bodies. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  We want to say figuratively, of course. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=361.52s)]
*  We want to say to them, let people marry who they love. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=364.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=366.8s)]
*  Your majority will either be 50-50 with Vice President Harris as a tiebreaker or if it will [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=369.04s)]
*  be 50-149, depending on what happens with Senator Warnock's runoff election in Georgia on December [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=374.64s)]
*  6th. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=380.56s)]
*  Can you explain to me and to our audience what the practical difference is in terms of how the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=381.36s)]
*  Senate runs? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you've been at 50-50 these past couple of years. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  It required a power sharing agreement with the Republicans. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=391.12s)]
*  How different would the Senate be? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=394.56s)]
*  How different would your life be? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=396.0s)]
*  How different would your ambitions be if it was 51-49 instead of 50-50? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=397.20000000000005s)]
*  It's not 1% different. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=402.24s)]
*  It's very different for the better. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=403.92s)]
*  For one thing, any time a judge or a nominee to the administration, we've had a lot of good [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=406.0s)]
*  progressive nominees, gets a vote out of committee that's, you know, 10-10, that's tied, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=411.68s)]
*  it delays things for a week. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=416.8s)]
*  You have to go to the floor. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=418.56s)]
*  You have to get the time and you have to bring Kamala Harris there and do what's called a [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=420.16s)]
*  motion to discharge out of committee. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=424.8s)]
*  If we have 51, there'll be no more motions to discharge. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  It will mean appointees and judges will get appointed much more quickly. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=430.0s)]
*  And, you know, we've had a great record with judges. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=433.92s)]
*  We've set the record as of today, actually, 83 new judges, two-thirds women, half people of color, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=436.0s)]
*  and progressive judges, not just partners in law firms and prosecutors, but legal aid [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=443.52000000000004s)]
*  attorneys and immigration lawyers and consumer advocates, things like that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=448.96s)]
*  So that'll make that a lot easier. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=453.59999999999997s)]
*  The second thing it does is you can get different bills out of committee much more quickly. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=456.0s)]
*  Third, we can have subpoena power. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=461.44s)]
*  With 50-50, you can't really get subpoena power. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  So it means it's a lot easier to get things done. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  And one other thing, when you have 50 senators, and obviously, any one senator can say, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=469.84s)]
*  I'm not voting for it unless I get this, this, or this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=474.32s)]
*  When it's 51, it's harder to do. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=476.88s)]
*  So you put all that together. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=479.2s)]
*  Plus, that extra seat helps us in 2024 keep the majority. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=481.04s)]
*  I'm always trying to think ahead. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=484.4s)]
*  It's a world of difference. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=485.76s)]
*  And Raphael Warnock is just a great person. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=487.52s)]
*  He's been a great senator for Georgia. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=490.56s)]
*  Service has been his motto, whether as a minister, head of the Ebenezer Baptist Church, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  as a senator, he's the person who took the lead on getting insulin in Medicare only [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=500.24s)]
*  across $35 instead of the $600, $700, $800. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=505.28s)]
*  He's one of the people who's taken the lead so that disadvantaged farmers in Georgia, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=508.64s)]
*  poor farmers, will get some help they have been discriminated against in the past. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=512.8s)]
*  He's one of the people who took the lead on expanding the ACA so more people got health [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=517.52s)]
*  care and it was cheaper. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=522.0s)]
*  Issues that really mattered to people Warnock has already produced. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=523.28s)]
*  So if I was a Georgian, and this race is going to be decided only by Georgians, I'd say, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=526.8s)]
*  this guy produces for me. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=531.68s)]
*  It's not a lot of rhetoric and bombast. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=533.52s)]
*  It's serious stuff. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=535.28s)]
*  Senator Schumer, one last question for you. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=537.76s)]
*  That the point that you just made a moment ago about how one, any one senator when it's 50-50 [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=539.6s)]
*  can stand up and decide they're going to throw a wrench in the works. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, if it's not what I want exactly, then I'm going to stop everything. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=547.68s)]
*  This is a little bit delicate to say, but we all know that it was really Senator Sinema, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=551.12s)]
*  who you just mentioned a moment ago for her leadership on the marriage equality bill [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  and also Senator Manchin in West Virginia, who were the ones who were kind of throwing [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  the wrench in the works more often than anybody else. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  Are you 100% sure that neither of them is considering switching to the Republican Party [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=569.44s)]
*  so they could be the star once again in an even bigger way so that they could sort of monkey [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=574.96s)]
*  wrench this whole process? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=579.84s)]
*  Well, they look they had very difficult positions. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=582.0s)]
*  I disagreed with them rather strongly in many ways, but they've kept being [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=586.0s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=590.4000000000001s)]
*  It would have been easy for them to do it, you know, in the past, but they have strong beliefs, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=591.2800000000001s)]
*  different ways. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=596.4000000000001s)]
*  Senator Sinema is passionate on LGBTQ rights. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=597.84s)]
*  Senator Sinema is leading pro-choice. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=602.0s)]
*  She wouldn't find much of a home in the Republican Party there, I suppose. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  Their mansion has been very progressive on certain issues as well, including prescription drugs. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=607.6s)]
*  And so, you know, I don't I think they they differ from us in many ways, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=614.08s)]
*  but I don't think either of them would be comfortable in the Republican Party. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=619.52s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who I should mention was himself just reelected [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=624.24s)]
*  and who also is about to start another term as Majority Leader in the United States Senate. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=628.48s)]
*  Sir, it's an honor to have you with us tonight. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=632.72s)]
*  Thank you so much and congratulations. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=634.48s)]
*  Pleasure's mine, Rachel. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=635.76s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=636.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=637.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lknY-Pkaow&t=649.52s)]
