# DOJ says it has charged Rep. McIver over incident at Newark ICE facility
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0)
*  Okay, on Friday night, you might have seen The Washington Post publish this headline. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump Justice Department considers removing key check on lawmaker prosecutions. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  The Post reporting on a proposal inside the Justice Department to make it so federal prosecutors [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=9.52s)]
*  across the country could indict sitting members of Congress without getting approval from [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=13.6s)]
*  lawyers in Maine Justice's Public Integrity Section. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=19.14s)]
*  So any random U.S. attorney anywhere in the country could indict a sitting member of Congress [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=23.16s)]
*  on their own say so without even needing to run it by anyone in Washington. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=27.24s)]
*  That story broke on Friday and it's obviously a big deal, right? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=31.959999999999997s)]
*  One of the reasons the Public Integrity Section exists at DOJ is to prevent prosecutors from [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=34.44s)]
*  bringing politically motivated charges. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=38.94s)]
*  With this change, prosecutors could indict members of Congress on their own with no oversight [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=41.839999999999996s)]
*  and no check against politically motivated prosecutions. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=46.28s)]
*  But like I said, as of Friday, The Washington Post was just reporting this as a proposal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Well now tonight, we got this news. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=56.44s)]
*  I mentioned it at the very top of the show. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=58.0s)]
*  Two weeks ago, Democratic Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ross Baraka, was arrested [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=61.36s)]
*  by shambolic, unprofessional, very obviously out of their depth, masked Homeland Security [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=65.88s)]
*  officers while the mayor was protesting outside of an ICE detention center in his city. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=73.44s)]
*  At the time, Trump's newly appointed U.S. attorney for New Jersey charged the mayor [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=79.02s)]
*  with one count of trespassing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=83.4s)]
*  Tonight, that U.S. attorney, her name is Alina Habba. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=85.52s)]
*  She's one of Trump's old defense lawyers. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=88.4s)]
*  Before that, she represented like parking garage companies. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  Tonight, she dropped the case against Mayor Ross Baraka, but then she brought a new charge [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=93.4s)]
*  against a Democratic member of Congress. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=99.72s)]
*  Congresswoman LaMonica McIver was with Mayor Baraka at the ICE detention center when he [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  was arrested. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=108.10000000000001s)]
*  Alina Habba has now charged Congresswoman McIver with assault, claiming that she assaulted, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=109.48s)]
*  impeded, and interfered with law enforcement at the ICE facility. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  Congresswoman McIver has responded with this statement, quote, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=120.64s)]
*  Earlier this month, I joined my colleagues to inspect the treatment of ICE detainees [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  at Delaney Hall in my district. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  We were fulfilling our lawful oversight responsibilities, as members of Congress have done many times [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=129.72s)]
*  before. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=134.52s)]
*  The charges against me are purely political. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=135.52s)]
*  They mischaracterize and distort my actions. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  They are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  And indeed, federal law explicitly protects the rights of members of Congress to inspect [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=144.84s)]
*  federal detention centers for immigrants, even with zero notice that they are doing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=149.96s)]
*  so. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=154.08s)]
*  Now, this story only just broke. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=155.08s)]
*  We reached out to Alina Habba's office, the U.S. attorney's office for the state of New [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  Jersey, to ask if they got approval from the public integrity section at Maine Justice [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=159.52s)]
*  For these charges they have now brought against a sitting Congresswoman, we have yet to hear [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=164.28s)]
*  back. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=169.68s)]
*  We'll let you know when we do. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoSAxsdL-F0&t=170.68s)]
