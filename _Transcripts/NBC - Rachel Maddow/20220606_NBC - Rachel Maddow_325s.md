# Zinke Seeks To Join Cast Of GOP's Dubious Character Candidates
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow)
*  You know what, Glenn, I'm gonna say something now, probably shouldn't. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=0.0s)]
*  Do you know right now I have something that can bring you into a building that would clean [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=3.6s)]
*  you from COVID as you walk through this dry mix? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=10.52s)]
*  As you walk through the door, it would kill any COVID on your body. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=14.0s)]
*  When you leave, it would kill the virus as you leave this product. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  They don't want to talk about that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=23.32s)]
*  They don't want to hear about that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=25.2s)]
*  I'm Raphael Warnock and I approve this message. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=27.8s)]
*  That's a new campaign ad from Democratic Georgia U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock showing [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=31.8s)]
*  his Republican Senate opponent pushing a mist, a magic mist that can clean you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=36.8s)]
*  He says he has this magic mist. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=44.2s)]
*  He uses the magic mist to turn doorways into 100 percent cures for COVID. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  That is the kind of ad you can run when your opponent is Herschel Walker. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=53.6s)]
*  There's a reason Mr. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=56.8s)]
*  Walker refuses to show up, refused to show up for his primary debates when he was running [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  to become the Republican nominee for Senate in Georgia. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=63.8s)]
*  I mean, if your candidate accidentally veered into I have a magic mist cure for COVID right [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=66.6s)]
*  here and no one wants to hear about it, if your guy veered into that territory every [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=71.8s)]
*  time he got behind a microphone, you'd probably try to keep him away from a microphone, too. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=76.0s)]
*  We will see if he agrees to debate Raphael Warnock now that he is the Republican nominee [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=80.2s)]
*  for Senate in Georgia. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=86.0s)]
*  Herschel Walker really is the Republican Party's nominee for Senate in Georgia, which does [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=87.4s)]
*  seem kind of crazy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=92.4s)]
*  Then again, is that any crazier than the candidate Republicans chose for Senate in Pennsylvania? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=94.8s)]
*  After all, that candidate has also been accused of peddling his share of snake oil cures for [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=100.6s)]
*  various real ailments. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=106.8s)]
*  Even how he ended up being the Republican candidate for Pennsylvania is still a mystery. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=109.2s)]
*  The Republican Senate candidate, Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, is a man who is from Ohio. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=115.4s)]
*  He has a home in Florida. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=120.8s)]
*  He votes in New Jersey. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=122.8s)]
*  He has no discernible connection to Pennsylvania whatsoever. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=124.4s)]
*  But alongside Herschel Magic Mist Walker as the Republican Senate candidate in Georgia, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=128.4s)]
*  the no connection to Pennsylvania guys who Republicans have picked to be their Senate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=135.2s)]
*  candidate in that state as well. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=138.8s)]
*  Then again, is Mehmet Oz being the Republican Pennsylvania Senate candidate any crazier [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=142.6s)]
*  than the candidate Republicans chose as their nominee for governor in Pennsylvania? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  He after all is a sword-wielding election denier who has been subpoenaed by the January [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=154.4s)]
*  6th investigation to talk about, among other things, his role in putting forth a fake slate [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  of Trump electors from Pennsylvania, even though Trump lost Pennsylvania. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=164.5s)]
*  With each new primary election this year, the Republican Party has made sort of increasingly [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=170.6s)]
*  wild choices for who their nominees are going to be to represent them in November's elections. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=176.6s)]
*  Well, tomorrow we're going to get more because tomorrow there are primary elections in seven [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=182.6s)]
*  more states. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=188.6s)]
*  And if you are looking to see who might be the next list, the next guy on the list of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=190.6s)]
*  this amazing cast of characters Republicans have been nominating this year, you may want [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=195.6s)]
*  to pay particular attention to Montana, Montana Republican Congressional contender Ryan Zinke. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=199.6s)]
*  If that face is familiar to you, if that name sounds familiar to you, it's probably because [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=207.6s)]
*  you remember him from one of his 18 gazillion different scandals during his time as Trump's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=211.6s)]
*  Interior Secretary. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=218.6s)]
*  And I mean, when I say 18, it wasn't 18 gazillion, but it really was 18 different [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=220.6s)]
*  federal investigations involving Ryan Zinke during his time as a Trump cabinet member. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=226.6s)]
*  Like the time he spent $12,000 of taxpayer money so he could fly in an oil executive's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=231.6s)]
*  private plane, or the time he allegedly spent $139,000 taxpayer dollars on a set of fancy [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=236.6s)]
*  new doors for his office? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=242.6s)]
*  $140,000 worth of doors? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=244.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=246.6s)]
*  Or the time he overruled federal experts to block a Native American casino project right [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=247.6s)]
*  after he met with lobbyists from a rival casino giant? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=252.6s)]
*  Or the time he allegedly tried to get an executive from the oil company Halliburton to build [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=256.6s)]
*  Mr. Zinke his own microbrewery at a time when Halliburton had business before the Interior [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=261.6s)]
*  Department? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=266.6s)]
*  Ryan Zinke was, this is tough competition. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=267.6s)]
*  Ryan Zinke, though, was perhaps the most scandal-plagued member of the Trump cabinet [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=271.6s)]
*  if you just look at scandals sort of by volume in terms of the number of months he served [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=277.6s)]
*  versus the number of formal federal investigations that had to be opened into his conduct. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=283.6s)]
*  Ryan Zinke really set some records. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=288.6s)]
*  I mean, him and Scott Pruitt were kind of neck and neck, but Ryan Zinke was really something. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=290.6s)]
*  And tomorrow, Republicans are going to decide whether or not they're going to make Ryan [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=294.6s)]
*  Zinke the latest in this year's very long string of quite amazing Republican candidates [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=298.6s)]
*  for office. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYDGmiGjmow&t=303.6s)]
