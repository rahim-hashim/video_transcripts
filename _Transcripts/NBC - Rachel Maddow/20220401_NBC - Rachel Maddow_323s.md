# Navalny's Russian Anti-Corruption Groups Stays Active Beyond Putin's Reach
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0)
*  Today we saw anti-war protests as far away as in Syria and India. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=0.0s)]
*  These protesters held up the Ukrainian flag outside of an Indian government building during [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=6.8s)]
*  a visit from Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=10.6s)]
*  India, by the way, is making no effort to distance itself from Russia, but some Indian [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=13.48s)]
*  people are. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  In Turkey, we've seen anti-war protests all week as Ukrainian and Russian negotiators held [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=18.36s)]
*  peace talks. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=23.6s)]
*  Earlier this week in Prague, we saw several thousand Russian expats protest the Russian [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=24.72s)]
*  invasion. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=29.6s)]
*  But in Russia itself, if there were any protests this week, we didn't hear about them. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=30.8s)]
*  At the beginning of the war, Russians turned out en masse to protest the war. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=35.32s)]
*  More than 15,000 protesters have been arrested to date. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=39.28s)]
*  So what's the future of the Russian opposition? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Is there one? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=46.02s)]
*  Well, last week, the de facto leader of Russia's opposition movement, Alexei Navalny, was sentenced [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=47.02s)]
*  to nine years in a maximum security prison on gin-ed-up charges by the Russian government. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=52.46s)]
*  Navalny founded an organization called the Anti-Corruption Foundation that put out reports [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=58.24s)]
*  and made videos documenting exactly how corruption in the Russian government was lining the pockets [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  of Russian oligarchs and Vladimir Putin himself. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=68.54s)]
*  Russia's charges against Navalny were that the Anti-Corruption Foundation was somehow [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=72.6s)]
*  a fraud itself and that Navalny was stealing money from it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=77.48s)]
*  These charges were widely seen as a warning. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  Russia's government essentially saying that if you investigate Russian corruption, you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=85.0s)]
*  will end up in a penal colony. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=89.2s)]
*  After his sentencing, Navalny was allowed to make a statement to the court. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=92.12s)]
*  Authorities eventually cut off the feed, but let me read you a translation of how he started. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=95.68s)]
*  Quote, I want to use my last words to make an official announcement for those who think [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=100.64s)]
*  that the Anti-Corruption Foundation will stop, will finish, will slow down, will fall into [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=104.8s)]
*  decay. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=110.84s)]
*  No. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=111.84s)]
*  Not only will it not stop, but the Anti-Corruption Foundation will become global. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=113.16s)]
*  We will establish an international Anti-Corruption Foundation, which of course will still focus [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=119.28s)]
*  on the swindlers and thieves from the Kremlin. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  Over the course of the last month, as the international community has levied sanctions [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=128.96s)]
*  against hundreds of Russian individuals, many of them are individuals whose abuses have been [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=133.12s)]
*  by Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation for years. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=139.44s)]
*  So on the one hand, it's become significantly harder to voice opposition from inside Russia, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=143.48s)]
*  but at the same time, the Russian opposition based outside Russia has never had this much [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=148.92s)]
*  international support. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=153.88s)]
*  Joining us now is Vladimir Ashurkov. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=157.28s)]
*  He is the executive director of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=159.4s)]
*  Mr. Ashurkov, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=163.24s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=166.56s)]
*  Your organization, the Anti-Corruption Fund, has been documenting Russian corruption and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=169.04s)]
*  kleptocracy for years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=173.8s)]
*  Obviously, these sanctions have hit, as you said, the elite in a place that you've been [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=176.12s)]
*  trying to get them hit for a while. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=182.56s)]
*  Have they had the effect that you're hoping they have? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=184.4s)]
*  Are these elites, are these people who are wealthy, are these people who are dealing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=187.64s)]
*  and trading with Vladimir Putin feeling enough pressure to be able to fight back or even [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=192.46s)]
*  speak out about it? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=197.1s)]
*  We have been advocating personal sanctions against people involved in corruption and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=201.78s)]
*  human rights abuse for years. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=206.5s)]
*  And if the Western countries have been more belligerent in counting Putin's assertiveness [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=209.06s)]
*  over the last eight years, we might have averted the catastrophe of the last month and a half. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=216.26s)]
*  We are where we are. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=223.62s)]
*  And over the last month, there has been an avalanche of personal sanctions. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=225.22s)]
*  Sanctions, it's a blunt instrument. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  It's not a silver bullet that will guarantee removal of Putin and Russia returning to the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  normal path of development. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  They don't have a short-term effect. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=244.1s)]
*  If you sanction an oligarch today, it's naive to expect that he will make an appointment [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=246.86s)]
*  with Putin and persuade him to end the hostilities in Ukraine, and everything will go back to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=254.54s)]
*  normal situation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=263.62s)]
*  But these sanctions, they do create a motivation for people in the elite to come up with a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  plan to change things in Russia, because only after things in Russia are changed, people [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=274.74s)]
*  that have amassed billions during Putin's era can expect the sanctions to be lifted. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=283.74s)]
*  Vladimir Ashurkov, thank you for joining us. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=294.14000000000004s)]
*  You are the executive director of Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=296.34s)]
*  We appreciate your time tonight. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nxMCa0ivu0&t=300.58s)]
