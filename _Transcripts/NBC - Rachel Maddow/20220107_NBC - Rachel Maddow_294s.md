# Real Agenda Of Supreme Court Conservatives Seen In Treatment Of Vaccine Mandate Case
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0)
*  As Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern put it today at Slate.com, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=0.0s)]
*  quote, where the liberal justices see sickness and death, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=4.26s)]
*  the conservatives see a chance to crush government. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=7.8s)]
*  It's a familiar pattern we've been watching play out all year, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=11.16s)]
*  whether it's abortion rights or gun safety legislation, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=14.18s)]
*  or policies aimed at combating a global pandemic. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=16.94s)]
*  The Supreme Court soon could become the place where [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  major health and safety laws in America go to die. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=22.36s)]
*  What is there to be done about that? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=26.98s)]
*  Joining us now is Dahlia Lithwick, senior editor and legal correspondent for [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=29.18s)]
*  Slate, whose latest piece is titled COVID is an Emergency. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=32.62s)]
*  To SCOTUS' conservatives, it's also an opportunity. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=36.68s)]
*  Good evening, Dahlia, good to see you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=40.22s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=41.5s)]
*  You do this thing that most Americans don't do and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=43.379999999999995s)]
*  you listen to these proceedings and you catch some of the nuances in them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=46.1s)]
*  And one of them that you caught today, you wrote about, you said, so [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=50.42s)]
*  acute is the contagion of medical misinformation coming from the court [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=54.3s)]
*  itself that the three liberals had to keep clarifying for themselves as much as [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=58.58s)]
*  the public that the government is not proposing an Orwellian employment [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=63.46s)]
*  hellscape so much as safe and effective mitigation efforts for [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=67.96s)]
*  a lethal virus that is emptying workplaces, filling hospitals, and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=71.78s)]
*  debilitating medical professionals. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=75.94s)]
*  I was a little alarmed to read that, that you were sort of feeling like some of this [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=78.42s)]
*  anti-vax nonsense that we associate with people out there is surfacing at the court. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=82.38s)]
*  Uh, it was almost impossible to miss. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=89.54s)]
*  Uh, I mean, justice Alito pretty explicitly started talking with the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=92.34s)]
*  solicitor general of the United States, Elizabeth Prelogger about how there [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  are risks to this vaccine. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=104.34s)]
*  And he kept saying, I don't want to be misunderstood. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=106.14000000000001s)]
*  I know the FDA has approved them, but there are risks, there are risks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=108.62s)]
*  And she literally didn't know how to answer him because she said, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=114.14000000000001s)]
*  by orders of magnitude, the vaccine is better than not the vaccine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=118.14s)]
*  But there was just this drip drip of suspicion about the vaccine, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=123.78s)]
*  suspicion about the administration's motives, suspicions about how long this [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=128.22s)]
*  is going to last. The chief justice raised the specter of this nefarious [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  agency by agency by agency creep to sort of do an end run around civil liberties. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=137.82s)]
*  It really felt like you were taking crazy pills, like you weren't sitting in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=144.7s)]
*  the midst of a peaking catastrophic pandemic. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=149.82s)]
*  The level of mistrust that you heard from the court's conservatives was just [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=154.18s)]
*  frankly shocking. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=159.01999999999998s)]
*  Let's talk about the, uh, the employer mandate. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=161.34s)]
*  The night it was announced, I spoke on this show to a former OSHA director who [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=164.62s)]
*  made the point that the way OSHA works and anybody who works in a place that has [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=171.14s)]
*  that's governed by OSHA has those posters up that are either in the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=175.82s)]
*  cafeteria or some central place. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  And that is that if there is a hazard that you as an employer can prevent your [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=180.01999999999998s)]
*  workers from being exposed to, you have an obligation to do so. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=184.42s)]
*  And the way this mandate seemed to be phrased is that COVID is a hazard and you [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  can take steps to prevent your employees from from getting it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=192.89999999999998s)]
*  So you should do so. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=196.14s)]
*  They, the former director seemed to think that that made it legally sound. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  What's happened to that? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=203.26s)]
*  Two things have happened. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=205.82s)]
*  One, I think there was an argument being pressed today that this isn't the same as [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=207.06s)]
*  sparks or flames or something in the workplace. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=213.1s)]
*  This is something different. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=216.18s)]
*  And so it can't be regulated as though it's something connected to a conveyor belt or [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=218.78s)]
*  workplace, to which Justice Sotomayor said this is as though the thing that is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  sparking or flaming is the human being who is coughing particles into the air. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  It's exactly the same. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=234.5s)]
*  The workplace is dangerous. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=235.94s)]
*  But the much larger project here, and I think you flicked at this in your initial [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=237.58s)]
*  question, is to really do away with the administrative state, to do away with the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=241.7s)]
*  regulatory state that enables agencies to create laws quickly. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=247.06s)]
*  And this is part of a much larger project to dismantle the EPA, to dismantle HHS, to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  dismantle OSHA, all under this large, large claim of you can call it the non-delegation [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=259.74s)]
*  doctrine, you can call it the major questions doctrine. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=265.7s)]
*  But basically the idea that all of government is somehow unconstitutional. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7H-CAjPIH0&t=268.42s)]
