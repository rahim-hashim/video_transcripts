# Trump fills administration with 'big team of losers' that voters have already rejected
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw)
*  I want to show you something here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=0.0s)]
*  See if you can spot the pattern here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=3.44s)]
*  A few days ago, Donald Trump appointed a new spokesperson for the Defense Department. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=6.28s)]
*  His name is Sean Parnell. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=11.36s)]
*  If that name sounds at all familiar, it's because the last thing he did in politics [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=12.72s)]
*  was fail in his effort to win a U.S. Senate seat from Pennsylvania. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=18.32s)]
*  Mr. Parnell dropped out of the Republican primary after a judge took away custody of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=24.88s)]
*  his children and ruled that Mr. Parnell had been violent and abusive toward the children [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=29.36s)]
*  and his wife. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=35.72s)]
*  His wife had accused him, among other things, of throwing chairs at her, of dropping her [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=37.2s)]
*  off on an interstate on the side of the road when she was six months pregnant and telling [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=42.56s)]
*  her to get an abortion. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  She accused him of choking and strangling her. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=49.1s)]
*  He denies the allegations, but that all came out during the campaign. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=54.54s)]
*  And after the judges ruling in that case, Mr. Parnell dropped out of the Republican [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=57.98s)]
*  primary and he thus failed to win that U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=62.26s)]
*  That is the last thing that Sean Parnell did in public life. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=67.42s)]
*  That's the last thing he did in politics. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  Now Donald Trump has named him spokesman for the Pentagon. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=74.06s)]
*  Person who won that Republican primary for that Senate seat in Pennsylvania and then [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=79.62s)]
*  lost the Senate race in the general election. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=84.18s)]
*  That was Mehmet Oz, Dr. Oz. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=86.98s)]
*  Trump has now named him to run Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=90.76s)]
*  So that was the Pennsylvania Senate seat. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=96.56s)]
*  In the Georgia Senate races, there were four different Republicans who lost while trying [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=98.62s)]
*  to get Senate seats from Georgia in 2020 and 2022, who have all now been named to things [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=104.88000000000001s)]

*  You noticing a theme here? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=260.7s)]
*  I mean, I could go on, but are you noticing a theme? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=262.06s)]
*  I mean, people keep saying no one elected Elon Musk, and that is definitely true. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=266.9s)]
*  But you know, at least in his case, he didn't try. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=272.06s)]
*  He didn't run for something and have the people resoundingly say, no, we don't want you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=275.62s)]
*  We'd prefer someone else and not you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=281.38s)]
*  And so you will lose this race. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=283.54s)]
*  But in this second term, they really are stuffing the whole administration with people who have [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=287.56s)]
*  not just once upon a time lost an election here or there. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=292.6s)]
*  All politicians at some point usually lose something. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=296.3s)]
*  No, this is like the last thing you did was lose a thing. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=299.02s)]
*  They almost seem to be going out of their way to find people for whom the last thing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=303.18s)]
*  they did in politics, the last thing they did in public life was ask the public to approve [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=306.5s)]
*  of them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=311.36s)]
*  And the public said, no, we do not want you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=312.36s)]
*  It's almost as if they are going out of their way to say, oh, you, the people are saying [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=316.0s)]
*  no, we say that doesn't matter because you may not want this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=320.2s)]
*  You may not want this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=325.88s)]
*  You may not want us, but this is who and what you're getting and you're stuck with it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=326.88s)]
*  Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote her her famous brilliant book about Abraham Lincoln building [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  his brave, capable government out of a team of rivals with Trump. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  It's like a big team of losers, people who the American people explicitly do not want. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=343.2s)]
*  People who just had the opportunity to be voted into office by the American people and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  the American people said definitively, no, don't want you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=359.32s)]
*  And so Trump is saying, well, that's who you're getting and you'll like it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=364.08s)]
*  How many of these folks can I find? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3i0d3ZsCjw&t=368.24s)]
