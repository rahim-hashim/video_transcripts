# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: July 24
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps)
*  But among these seven states from which we had fake electors, it's a lot of fake electors, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, 16 of them already charged in Michigan, more of them being investigated as we speak, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=4.64s)]
*  at least in Arizona and in Georgia, maybe in other places as well. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=10.16s)]
*  It's a good reminder that in all these investigations that we are following around [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  particularly the efforts to overthrow the results of the 2020 election, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=20.48s)]
*  it's not just former President Donald Trump who's in the crosshairs. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=25.44s)]
*  For example, in special counsel Jack Smith's classified documents case, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=29.12s)]
*  charges have of course already been brought against Trump and also his staffer, Walt Nauda. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=32.72s)]
*  But we also have reporting that another Trump organization employee has been told that they're [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=39.2s)]
*  the target of that investigation and could face additional criminal charges. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=43.28s)]
*  Again, so yet another person could be charged in the classified documents case. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=47.84s)]
*  A person has been warned of charges, effectively given a target letter in that case. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=52.24s)]
*  And while we have yet to see any charges in the January 6th case and the overturning the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=56.4s)]
*  election part of the case, one of the statutes reportedly listed in the target letter that Trump [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  has received on that is conspiracy. And if there's one thing we know about conspiracy charges, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=66.0s)]
*  it's that a person cannot conspire alone. Are there more names to drop? And what would that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=73.6s)]
*  mean for the likely progress of these cases? Joining us now is Chuck Rosenberg. He's a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=80.8s)]
*  former U.S. attorney and senior FBI official. If Trump is charged with conspiracy, and again, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  we should say we have reporting about what's in his target letter. Even if we had definitive [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  knowledge of what was in the target letter, there's no guarantee that what's in the target letter [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=97.12s)]
*  is indicative that charges will be brought or that the charges that will be brought are those that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=101.36s)]
*  are related to the statutes mentioned in the target letter. I have to give you all the caveats. But [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=106.24s)]
*  it with all those caveats, if Trump is charged with conspiracy, there's no guarantee that his [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  conspirators, people he conspired with, would be charged under the same indictment or indeed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  charged at all, right? That's exactly right. One can be an unindicted co-conspirator. In fact, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=123.84s)]
*  if you think back to Michael Cohen's charges in the Southern District of New York, and of course, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=129.92s)]
*  Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, in that indictment, we learned about an unindicted [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=135.28s)]
*  co-conspirator. Individual one is how the government described that person in the indictment, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=140.72s)]
*  and that turned out to be Mr. Trump himself. You know, charging a case as a conspiracy confers on [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=146.16s)]
*  the government certain evidentiary advantages. I'm not going to bore you with those now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  So it makes sense often to charge a conspiracy, and often when you charge a conspiracy, you have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=157.44s)]
*  multiple defendants at trial. But to your point, Rachel, you're exactly right. You don't have to. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=163.76s)]
*  You can have unindicted co-conspirators that are flagged by the grand jury and mentioned in the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=169.04s)]
*  indictment, but not sitting next to the defendant, perhaps Mr. Trump, at his own criminal trial. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  – Chuck, I have to ask you, I can't let you go without asking you one last question, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  which is the question on everybody's mind in the news business this week, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=186.0s)]
*  which is what our expectations should reasonably be about the relationship between that reported [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=189.68s)]
*  target letter and any indictment and any unsealing of an indictment against Trump if one is in fact coming. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=195.76s)]
*  – Yeah, another great question. Well, when I was a federal prosecutor, I would occasionally [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=202.16s)]
*  send out target letters. I would never send out a target letter to somebody that I did not intend to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=207.04s)]
*  indict. They're not bluffs. They're not games. They're not make-believe. So here's what you ought [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=214.24s)]
*  to expect. If Mr. Trump really did receive a target letter, then he will be charged with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  federal crimes. If he really received a target letter, that will happen relatively soon. Now, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  to your points earlier, your caveats are wise. Target letters are not contracts, and the government [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  could change its mind. But in my experience, that would be unusual. What you should expect [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=236.8s)]
*  is a federal indictment of Mr. Trump and a federal indictment soon. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=241.68s)]
*  – Alabama's legislature appears poised to do something very, very radical, to make sure that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  black voters in Alabama cannot elect representatives of their choice. You may have heard the Supreme [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  Court of the United States. This may have crossed your radar. The Supreme Court of the United States, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=261.04s)]
*  you might know, right now is a very conservative body, a 6-3 hard-right conservative majority on [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=267.52s)]
*  the nation's highest court as we speak. But even so, even that hard-line conservative 6-3 court [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  could not swallow the recent decision by Alabama's legislature to draw up congressional districts in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=284.64s)]
*  that state. So there's only one black-majority district in the whole state, in a state where a [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=290.88s)]
*  quarter of the population is black. The high court ordered the state of Alabama to make a new map [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=296.08s)]
*  where there are two such districts where black voters might be able to elect a representative [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=304.64s)]
*  of their choice. They have been ordered to do this by the federal courts. Alabama is refusing to do [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=310.64s)]
*  it, even though Alabama technically is a state in the United States of America, which is a country [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=316.4s)]
*  that is technically subject to the rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States. Even the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=324.4s)]
*  Alabama parts of the United States are subject to federal court orders. But apparently they're [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=329.2s)]
*  deciding on this issue that they maybe don't want to be. Alabama deciding it just might not follow [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=335.28s)]
*  federal court orders when it comes to black people voting in 2023, it's not like a, you know, a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  rascally little tantrum that Alabama is throwing here. This is a whole point of the country kind [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=350.56s)]
*  of stuff. This is as serious as it gets. I mean, defying federal court orders to state the obvious, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=355.84s)]
*  that is a fast drive down a short road for any country. And any state in the deep south, any [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  state that say seceded during the Civil War is very, very well aware of that. They are very well [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=366.88s)]
*  aware of how radical this is. But of course, it's even more resonant. It's even more incendiary to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=372.48s)]
*  do it right now. Because Governor slavery was not that bad. DeSantis really does not look like he's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=380.72s)]
*  going to go to the distance in the Republican nominating contest. He's just running a terrible, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=389.12s)]
*  terrible campaign that's sort of getting worse and more expensive by the day. He seems to be [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  the only person who ever had a prayer of being within shooting distance, proverbial shooting [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=402.0s)]
*  distance, forgive me, of the Republican front runner. I mean, the Republican Party really does [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=406.56s)]
*  poised, does look poised to renominate its front runner, to renominate the candidate who is [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=412.8s)]
*  dominating all their presidential polling by 20, 30, 40 points. And if nobody can get anywhere near [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=418.88s)]
*  him, if they do renominate Donald Trump as their candidate for president, that means the whole [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=424.4s)]
*  campaign for president, the whole election for president of the United States over the course of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=429.84s)]
*  this next year is going to be in large part a referendum on this question of whether we follow [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=434.56s)]
*  court orders anymore as a country, whether the legal system binds us, whether it binds all of us. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=444.0s)]
*  Because the likely Republican nominee for president, as things are going, the prohibitive [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=449.44s)]
*  favorite to be the Republican nominee for president, he is facing a trial in October [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=454.48s)]
*  on a quarter billion dollar civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  then another civil trial in January on defamation claims related to sexual assault allegations [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=464.24s)]
*  against him, then another civil trial later in January on a multimillion dollar civil fraud case [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=469.36s)]
*  related to an alleged pyramid scheme type thing that he was involved in, then a criminal trial [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=474.8s)]
*  in March on the New York state hush money charges, then a federal criminal trial in May on his [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=479.68s)]
*  federal felony criminal indictment for his handling of classified documents. And meanwhile, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  we're waiting on news of additional potential criminal indictments of him personally, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=489.68s)]
*  both at the federal level and in the state of Georgia related to his efforts to overthrow [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=493.68s)]
*  the government and stay in power after he lost reelection. So if that's the, you know, personal [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=497.92s)]
*  schedule of the Republican Party nominee for president, a busy and B, the election is going [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=503.36s)]
*  to be about this. It's going to be the referendum question posed both implicitly and explicitly by [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=510.8s)]
*  his candidacy. Do we choose him or do we choose law? Do we choose the law? Does the law apply to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=518.24s)]
*  us all? Does it protect us all? Does it constrain us all? Or do we want this guy instead? And all of [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=525.12s)]
*  the myriad things he has to offer. This is an amazing story. I can't believe this is real. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=531.6s)]
*  It's real. This is the Republican attorney general of Texas. His name is Ken Paxton, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=538.88s)]
*  although he is not currently serving as attorney general because he has been suspended from office [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=542.88s)]
*  by the Texas legislature pending an impeachment trial. Now, how bad do things have to be for the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  Republicans in the Texas legislature to impeach their own Republican attorney general? Well, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=553.44s)]
*  where do we start? Almost the entire time he's been attorney general, he's been under indictment [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=559.76s)]
*  for felony securities fraud. Meanwhile, he's facing potential disbarment from the practice of law [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=564.48s)]
*  entirely over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Also, he's under criminal [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=570.0s)]
*  investigation by the U.S. Justice Department on serious corruption allegations, allegations so [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=575.76s)]
*  serious that eight high ranking officials in his own office went to the FBI to report what they had [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=580.8s)]
*  witnessed in his office. Earlier this year, Paxton reached a multimillion dollar settlement [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=587.84s)]
*  in a lawsuit for allegedly firing several of those officials as retaliation for them going to the FBI. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=593.2800000000001s)]
*  It has been a lot with this guy, but hilariously, it was only when Paxton demanded that Texas [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=600.96s)]
*  taxpayers fork over the millions of dollars to pay that settlement that Republicans in the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  legislature finally started to get a little bit cranky with him. The Texas house impeached Ken [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=612.4s)]
*  Paxton by an overwhelming margin. So that means the Texas Senate now has to put him on trial. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=618.48s)]
*  They'll hold an impeachment trial in September. If he's convicted at that Senate impeachment trial, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=623.68s)]
*  he will lose his job permanently. Now, here's where it gets amazing. That trial will be presided over [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=628.72s)]
*  by the president of the Senate, the lieutenant governor of the state, a man named Dan Patrick. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=634.8s)]
*  As the presiding judge overseeing Paxton's impeachment trial, he'll have immense power. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=639.2s)]
*  He'll be the ultimate arbiter of like the rules and the admissibility of evidence and all that stuff. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=644.4000000000001s)]
*  Here's the thing. I can't believe is real, but it is. So Dan Patrick, the guy who's the presiding [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  judge in this impeachment trial, just had to release his new campaign finance report. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=656.6400000000001s)]
*  And would you look at that? He just received $3 million from the Ken Paxton super pack. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=662.32s)]
*  Wow. What a coincidence. Dan Patrick isn't even up for reelection until 2026. All he has coming up [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=673.36s)]
*  is this impeachment trial that he has to run in a few weeks. And here's the pack for the defendant [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=681.0400000000001s)]
*  in that impeachment trial, dumping $3 million on his porch. Just ahead of the trial. Wow. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=687.52s)]
*  Everything is bigger in Texas. Amazing. This map captures just, it's like a checklist [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=697.52s)]
*  of noncompliance. There was never any intent in this building to comply with that court order. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=708.8s)]
*  Never. Also, there was never any intent in this building to comply with the voting rights. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=714.4s)]
*  That was Alabama state lawmaker, Chris England, speaking on Friday, a Democrat lodging one [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=721.28s)]
*  final objection as Alabama Republicans defied an order from the United States Supreme Court [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=728.16s)]
*  to fix a very problematic congressional map. Last month, the Supreme Court found Alabama in [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=736.0799999999999s)]
*  violation of the Voting Rights Act. In Alabama, one in four voters is black, but Republicans in [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=742.32s)]
*  the legislature cleverly constructed the state's congressional districts. So only one of seven [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=748.6400000000001s)]
*  congressional districts in the state is majority black. That was too racially discriminatory, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=754.88s)]
*  even for this hard right conservative United States Supreme Court. And so the court ordered [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  Alabama to redraw the lines. So black voters would make up the majority of the majority or [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=767.12s)]
*  something quite close to it in two congressional districts, not just one. To that, Alabama Republicans [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=772.72s)]
*  just basically said, no, we won't do it. They did draw new lines for new districts, but the new [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=779.6s)]
*  lines don't include anything like a new majority black district. So what does this mean? I mean, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=784.96s)]
*  the sort of best case terrible scenario here is that Alabama Republicans are trying to stretch [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=792.08s)]
*  this out as long as possible to try and give themselves another shot at holding another [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=798.4s)]
*  election with illegal racially discriminatory maps that favor Republicans. That's the best [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=803.44s)]
*  case terrible scenario. The worst case terrible scenario is that Alabama Republicans are just [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=810.56s)]
*  deciding that they don't recognize the authority of the federal government and federal courts. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=816.08s)]
*  And that of course brings back all sorts of bad memories about what Alabama is capable of. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=820.24s)]
*  But when we're about to have a presidential election in which the central question is likely [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=825.92s)]
*  to be whether or not we as a country follow the law, whether the law applies to everyone, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=830.0s)]
*  this is a particularly incendiary move by Alabama Republicans, one that Alabama Democrats like state [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=834.8s)]
*  rep Chris England have been raising the alarm about. One thing that I always say about Alabama [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=841.68s)]
*  it continues to be the place where the dead bury the living. We're haunted by a ghost of the past [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=849.12s)]
*  and every time we get to a critical juncture where a better or better angels could lead us in a [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=857.12s)]
*  proper direction, we refuse and we say we dare defend our rights. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=862.4s)]
*  Joining us now is Chris England. He is a Democratic member of the Alabama House of Representatives, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=870.48s)]
*  Representative of England. I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight. Thank you. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=875.28s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=882.24s)]
*  I'm going to ask you about those two scenarios that I just mentioned there. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=884.4s)]
*  Do you think that Alabama Republicans are just sort of playing for time and knowing they're going [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=889.8399999999999s)]
*  to lose this but they're dragging it out as long as possible? Or do you think they really are making [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=895.4399999999999s)]
*  an attempt to resist or nullify this federal court order? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=899.92s)]
*  I think it's a host of different things. I think at the bare minimum it's an attempt to protect [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=907.04s)]
*  status quo but at the worst of it all I think it's an attempt to also buy time to use this legal [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=911.5999999999999s)]
*  map for two more years but the other part of it is I think it's an extension of the work that was [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=917.92s)]
*  done to eliminate section five of the Voting Rights Act from the Shelby County case to now [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=924.0s)]
*  maybe using this non-compliant, defiant map to go back to the Supreme Court and hopefully convince [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=930.4s)]
*  the justices that we're all conservatives here so throw us a bone and maybe finish off section two [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=939.92s)]
*  of the Voting Rights Act as well. So if the Supreme Court was already willing in the Shelby County case [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=946.24s)]
*  to gut the Voting Rights Act by getting rid of section five but section two still exists, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=953.2s)]
*  you think they may be doing this basically to tee up a case that would throw out [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=959.12s)]
*  the rest of the Voting Rights Act that would throw out section two as well? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=963.6s)]
*  Oh no, I don't doubt it. I think it's a long legal strategy that ultimately buys in either time or [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=967.0400000000001s)]
*  makes another argument to go after section two but on the other hand it also throws the entire [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=975.84s)]
*  map to one or two people, a special master will draw it and we basically shirked our [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=982.32s)]
*  response to constitutional responsibilities to represent our constituents and use them [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=988.32s)]
*  essentially as collateral damage for a political cause and it was actually driven by people [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=992.6400000000001s)]
*  who don't even live here. I don't know if you've heard this or not but the Speaker of the House, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=998.4000000000001s)]
*  McCarthy called the Senate sponsor of the map and told him he's interested in keeping his majority [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1004.08s)]
*  but I think Alabama citizens were probably more interested in the state keeping up to [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1010.8s)]
*  its obligations and following the law. Kevin McCarthy encouraging this, encouraging defiance [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1014.96s)]
*  of the federal courts in order to eke out more illegally defined Republican leaning districts [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1021.6800000000001s)]
*  obviously has disturbing national implications but so does just saying that court orders don't [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1028.56s)]
*  matter that if the federal courts are going to stand up and tell states what to do, states have [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1034.24s)]
*  an option to disobey those orders. I wonder Representative England, what's been the reaction [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1038.48s)]
*  among Alabama voters, among your constituents, among black voters in Alabama in general as this [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1046.8s)]
*  fight has played out the way it has? Disappointment discussed but not surprised. There's interesting [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1052.8s)]
*  context here that many African Americans who occupy elected spaces in Alabama are representing [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1062.64s)]
*  districts that are majority minority and that were created by court orders from lawsuits that [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1071.6000000000001s)]
*  were filed years ago. The 7th congressional district itself was a district created by a lawsuit [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1078.64s)]
*  in a court order and interestingly enough not only is the black voting age population [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1085.76s)]
*  in the newly created second congressional district 39% but the 7th congressional district [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1093.52s)]
*  this was was created by a court order for the specific purpose of electing an African American [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1101.76s)]
*  saw its black voting age population in this new map go from 55% to 50 which is just another you [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1106.96s)]
*  know just outright slap in the face if you're considering the fight and the history that [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1113.84s)]
*  Alabama shares with the rest of the country in terms of courts and the federal government having [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1118.72s)]
*  to force Alabama to do the right thing in situations like this. So it is not surprised but [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1126.1599999999999s)]
*  still disappointment in the fact that Alabama once again gets to this crucial threshold and fails to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1134.1599999999999s)]
*  do the right thing. Alabama State Representative Chris England. Sir thank you for joining us tonight [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1140.0s)]
*  I know this is not over we'd love to have you back and keep us surprised as this keeps as this [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1146.72s)]
*  fight keeps playing out. Oh yeah anytime I got a lot more to say. Good all right well I'll be back sir. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVsEFO44Ps&t=1150.72s)]
