# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 27
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08)
*  So Russia has huge supplies of oil and natural gas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=0.0s)]
*  I wrote a book about it called Blowout in case you ever want to do some homework on the fact. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=3.6s)]
*  But oil and gas constitute a huge, huge, huge proportion of Russia's economic lifeblood. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=6.8s)]
*  They don't do much else besides oil and gas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=14.0s)]
*  And today, the state-controlled Russian natural gas company, a company called Gazprom, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=16.6s)]
*  today they announced that they are cutting off natural gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  in what seems pretty clearly like retaliation for European support for Ukraine [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=27.4s)]
*  as Russia continues to wage their war there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=32.0s)]
*  Now, Bulgaria gets about 90% of their natural gas from Russia. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=34.8s)]
*  Russia just cut them off. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=38.6s)]
*  Despite that, the Bulgarians were pretty unflinching today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=40.0s)]
*  Their prime minister responded today by saying, quote, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=42.6s)]
*  We will not succumb to such a racket. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=44.8s)]
*  Poland, the other country that got cut off today, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=47.4s)]
*  they've been preparing for something like this from Russia for a long time. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  Among other things, in recent years, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=53.2s)]
*  Poland built itself a new liquefied natural gas terminal, shipping terminal, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=54.8s)]
*  which means they can get shiploads of liquefied natural gas [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=60.0s)]
*  brought in from any other country in the world [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  instead of having to rely just on the pipeline from Russia. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=65.39999999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, Russia just cut Poland off, but Poland was preparing for that anyway, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=69.0s)]
*  already trying to wean themselves off being dependent on Russia. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=72.8s)]
*  What Russia did today, it's just speeded up a timeline that was already in place [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=77.6s)]
*  for many European countries to start getting themselves off Russian gas, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=82.4s)]
*  because how can you depend on Russia for anything? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  Russia does have leverage in terms of cutting off petroleum products [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=90.0s)]
*  to countries that are dependent on them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  But there's also a problem here on Russia's side. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=95.0s)]
*  Russia itself can't go very long without selling its oil and gas, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=97.0s)]
*  in large part because it has nothing else to sell. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=100.4s)]
*  And a lot has been written lately about the fact that, you know, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  China or India or maybe some other markets will step up and take Russian energy supplies [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=106.4s)]
*  if Russians stop selling it westward. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=111.4s)]
*  But that's not practical from a purely logistics standpoint. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=114.0s)]
*  As the Associated Press points out today, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=117.2s)]
*  quote, the Russian gas pipeline network from the huge deposits [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  in northwestern Siberia to Europe don't connect with the pipelines running to China. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  And Russia has only limited facilities to export super chilled liquefied gas by ship. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  So they don't have the pipelines to send it anywhere but Europe. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=132.4s)]
*  And they don't have ships, really, to send it anywhere except into the pipelines. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=135.8s)]
*  Russia is ill-equipped to send gas to these other countries, right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=140.4s)]
*  There's also just the most, the more obvious point that you're dealing with a much lower volume [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  when you're moving a product by ship as opposed to putting it into a pipeline. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=149.0s)]
*  In any case, by picking this fight with Bulgaria and Poland, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=152.6s)]
*  Russia is more or less cutting off its nose despite its face. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, regardless of whether or not Russia had made such a move, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=158.8s)]
*  a European embargo on Russian oil and gas was already in the works. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=163.6s)]
*  That ban could be part of an upcoming sanctions package from the EU. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=167.0s)]
*  To underscore that point today, the president of the EU said, quote, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=170.8s)]
*  the era of Russian fossil fuel in Europe is coming to an end. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  Europe has known for a long time that they need to get off of Russian oil, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=178.8s)]
*  Europe knows they should have realized that becoming dependent on Russia [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=182.0s)]
*  for energy supplies was a bad idea. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  Russia, during the Cold War, keeping up its supplies despite all the vagaries of the Cold War, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=188.8s)]
*  that sort of gave Europe a good reason to play see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=196.0s)]
*  pretend it would all be fine. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=200.4s)]
*  But those illusions are now over. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=202.4s)]
*  What Russia did today, cutting off gas supplies to two countries, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=204.4s)]
*  two NATO countries, to try to force European countries to change their behavior, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=207.6s)]
*  there's just no way to hide from it anymore. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=212.0s)]
*  He's now proven the point indelibly. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=213.8s)]
*  Russia is a mafia state. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=216.0s)]
*  Don't do business with them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=217.8s)]
*  Don't be dependent on them in any way. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=219.0s)]
*  They will take any relationship they have with you and they will use it as power over you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=220.8s)]
*  I mean, cutting to the chase here, part of Putin turning Russia into a full-blown authoritarian fascist state [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=226.8s)]
*  is that they're now a corporatist state, which means that business interests and political interests in Russia are merged. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=232.6s)]
*  All economic power in Russia is harnessed to serve the state. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=237.4s)]
*  So, you know, Putin will use what normal countries might think of as a business relationship [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=242.2s)]
*  to go to war with you instead. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=247.4s)]
*  And nobody can avoid seeing it now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=249.4s)]
*  So, yeah, Poland's been prepping to get out from under Russian energy dependence. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  That will rush to completion now. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=256.2s)]
*  The same thing will happen in Bulgaria. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=258.2s)]
*  The same thing's even going to happen in places like Germany. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=260.0s)]
*  The same thing is going to happen in all of Europe. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=262.4s)]
*  What Putin did today will force Europe to cut the spigot from Russia faster than they ever would before. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=265.4s)]
*  In the long run, this means for Putin, honestly, I believe it, the game is up. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=273.2s)]
*  No context I could provide here would make this any less weird. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=278.0s)]
*  It is what it is and it stands on its own terms. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=281.2s)]
*  Ready? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=283.8s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=284.8s)]
*  Question. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=286.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you said if you see someone getting ready to throw a tomato, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=287.8s)]
*  just knock the crop out of them, would you? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  That was your statement? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=295.0s)]
*  Answer. Trump. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=296.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it was very dangerous. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=297.2s)]
*  Question. What was very dangerous? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=299.8s)]
*  Answer. Trump. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  We were threatened. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=302.4s)]
*  Question. With what? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=303.8s)]
*  Answer. Trump. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=305.4s)]
*  They were going to throw fruit. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=306.4s)]
*  We were threatened. We had a threat. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  Question. How did you become aware that there was a threat that people were going to throw fruit? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=311.0s)]
*  Answer. Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=316.1s)]
*  We were told. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=317.3s)]
*  I thought Secret Service was involved in that actually, but we were told. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=318.9s)]
*  And you get hit with fruit. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=322.8s)]
*  It's no, it's very violent stuff. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=324.2s)]
*  We were on alert for that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=327.0s)]
*  Question. A tomato is a fruit after all, I guess? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=328.6s)]
*  Answer. Trump. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=332.6s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=333.6s)]
*  Interjection from separate lawyer. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=335.0s)]
*  Judicial notice, please. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=336.6s)]
*  Apparently that is agreed to. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=338.7s)]
*  At which point Trump's own lawyer jumps in and says it has seeds, meaning a tomato has seeds. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=339.8s)]
*  Therefore, it's a fruit. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=346.7s)]
*  Trump then continues. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=349.0s)]
*  It's worse than tomato. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=350.5s)]
*  It's other things also. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=352.3s)]
*  But tomato, when they start doing that stuff, it's very dangerous. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=353.7s)]
*  That's actually literally the transcript. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=357.90000000000003s)]
*  But tomato, when they start doing that stuff, it's very dangerous. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=359.8s)]
*  Question. Who were you speaking to when you said answer? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=363.8s)]
*  Trump. The audience. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=367.3s)]
*  Question. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=368.6s)]
*  So you were speaking to the audience when you said if they saw someone getting ready to throw a tomato, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=369.5s)]
*  just knock the crap out of them, would you? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=374.2s)]
*  Answer. Trump. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=377.2s)]
*  That was to the audience. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=378.4s)]
*  It was said sort of in jest, but maybe, you know, a little truth to it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=379.7s)]
*  It's very dangerous stuff. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=384.7s)]
*  You can get killed with those things. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=387.1s)]
*  Question. So were you trying to incentivize people to engage in violence? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=390.3s)]
*  Trump's lawyer. Objection. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=394.3s)]
*  Trump answers anyway. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=396.1s)]
*  Trump. No, I wanted to have people be ready because we were put on alert that they were going to do fruit. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=397.3s)]
*  And some fruit is a lot worse than tomatoes are bad, by the way. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=404.2s)]
*  But it's very dangerous. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=408.3s)]
*  Question. Do you have any knowledge as to whether or not anybody was found to have tomatoes in their possession on that date? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=409.90000000000003s)]
*  Answer. Trump. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=416.2s)]
*  I don't know. But it didn't happen. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=417.3s)]
*  It worked out that nothing happened. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=419.6s)]
*  It was the speech was good. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=421.2s)]
*  Question. You said you were talking to the audience. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  But is the same true of your security? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=427.2s)]
*  Do you expect your security to knock the crap out of someone if they see them about? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=428.9s)]
*  Answer. Trump. I was talking to the audience. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=432.9s)]
*  Question. Mr. President, please let me finish the question so we can get the whole record very clear. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  Is it your expectation that if your security guards see someone about to throw a tomato that they should knock the crap out of that person? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=440.3s)]
*  Answer. Trump. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=449.0s)]
*  Well, a tomato, a pineapple, a lot of other things they throw. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=450.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think that they have to be aggressive in stopping that from happening. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=456.3s)]
*  Because if that happens, you can be killed if that happens. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=460.5s)]
*  Question. And getting aggressive in your terms, that includes the use of physical force? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=464.3s)]
*  Answer. Trump. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=470.0s)]
*  To stop somebody from throwing pineapples, tomatoes, bananas, stuff like that? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=471.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's dangerous stuff. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  I didn't, I am not smart enough to make something like this up. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=484.6s)]
*  I am not smart enough to make up something this perceptive about how a particular man's brain works. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=487.7s)]
*  If I was, I could write amazing textbooks for political science classes about what to look for when trying to identify a person who shouldn't be entrusted with a lot of power. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=494.1s)]
*  You imagined a pineapple might be thrown. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=504.9s)]
*  And so, yeah, you could be killed. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=507.1s)]
*  This is a deposition that was just released late last night. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=511.7s)]
*  It's a deposition taken from former President Donald Trump six months ago in an ongoing civil case in New York about some protesters who were beaten up outside Trump Tower shortly after Trump started his run for the presidency. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=514.6s)]
*  These protesters were beaten up by Trump's security guards. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=528.0s)]
*  And the protesters have contended in court that Trump is liable for them being beaten up that day because they contend that Trump directed his security guards to beat up the protesters. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=531.3000000000001s)]
*  And as part of them making their case, the protesters are trying to get at, trying to get at Trump's, as they would put it, Trump's established pattern of him asking people to physically attack others. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=542.3000000000001s)]
*  Him asking people particularly to physically attack other people who are protesting against him. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=556.6s)]
*  That argument, that line of argument in the civil case that Trump directed those security guards to attack and physically beat up those protesters, that is a pattern that Trump had established and has publicly displayed that line of argument from the plaintiffs in the civil case against Trump. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=564.1s)]
*  That's why this video was actually played in that deposition ahead of the questioning that I just read you. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=580.0s)]
*  So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=588.8s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=593.7s)]
*  Okay, just knock the hell out. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=595.5s)]
*  I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=597.6s)]
*  I promise. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=600.6s)]
*  I promise. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=601.7s)]
*  That was in 2016, February 2016, which is actually after these plaintiffs were beaten up by Trump security guards outside Trump Tower. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=603.6s)]
*  But these plaintiffs contend in court that Trump publicly imploring other people to knock the bleep out of people protesting, people posing the terrifying threat of potentially throwing a tomato. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=612.6s)]
*  That shows the pattern of Trump ordering violence against protesters, perhaps even violence out of keeping with any perceived threat the protesters might pose. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=626.8s)]
*  Now, if throwing a tomato is actually a lethal threat, though, what wouldn't be justified? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=637.0999999999999s)]
*  With the release of this deposition in this past day, we now know a whole new thing we didn't know before about former President Trump, which is that he is apparently desperately afraid of a flying tomato. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=644.0999999999999s)]
*  The Washington Post tonight is reporting that among the things the January 6th investigation in Congress is looking at is a number of different ways that Trump and his administration and people around him tried to get him to use the emergency powers of the president, which technically at least are a very limited thing, but how he tried to use them or considered using them to overthrow the election. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=657.3s)]
*  The Post reporting tonight that, quote, three days before Biden's inauguration, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene texted the White House chief of staff and told him that some Republican members of Congress believe the only path for President Trump to change the outcome of the election and stay in power was for him to declare martial law. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=678.8s)]
*  The text from Greene, which was revealed this week, brought to the fore the chorus of Republicans who were publicly and privately advocating for Trump to try to use the military and defense apparatus of the U.S. government to strong arm his way past an electoral defeat. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=694.7s)]
*  Now, discussions involving the Trump White House about using emergency powers have become an important but little known part of the January 6th investigation of the attack on the Capitol. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=708.7s)]
*  The Post says, quote, in subpoenas, document requests and court filings, the panels demanded information about any Trump administration plans to use presidential emergency powers to invoke martial law or take other steps to overturn the election. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=720.9000000000001s)]
*  Interviews with committee members and a review of the panel's information requests reveals a focus on emergency powers that were being considered by Trump and his allies in several categories. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=733.9000000000001s)]
*  Invoking the Insurrection Act, declaring martial law, using presidential powers to justify seizing voting machines, and using the military to require a rerun of the election. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=743.1s)]
*  Again, the Post reporting that those efforts to use presidential emergency powers to overthrow the election is a new and largely sort of overlooked, publicly overlooked part of what the January 6th investigation is looking at. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=755.1s)]
*  What does this new reporting mean? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=770.3000000000001s)]
*  And is this a whole new level of seriousness we hadn't really considered before? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=772.3000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Elizabeth Gautin. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=776.3000000000001s)]
*  She is co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, and she's in fact one of the experts on presidential emergency powers, as quoted in the Post's reporting today. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=778.3000000000001s)]
*  In the Post reporting, she argues that the emergency powers, quote, contain fundamental flaws that could lead to abuse, and she has said that these emergency powers should be a focus of the January 6th investigation. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=788.5s)]
*  Ms. Gautin, it's a real pleasure to have you with us tonight. Thank you. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=800.5s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=803.5s)]
*  So, I've always sort of been led to believe that emergency powers for a president or indeed an administration, particularly around elections, are quite limited. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=805.7s)]
*  But it sounds like the January 6th investigators have got their teeth into a number of different ways that those powers were at least attempted to be tapped by Trump and his allies in 2020. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=815.7s)]
*  I think the truth lies somewhere between what you thought about emergency powers and what, you know, Michael Flynn and Sidney Powell and Marjorie Taylor Queen were urging President Trump to do. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=826.9000000000001s)]
*  Emergency powers do not give the president limitless ability to do whatever he wants, such as seizing voting machines and overturning the results of an election. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=839.9000000000001s)]
*  In fact, there are no emergency powers that would allow a president to overturn the results of an election after those results are in. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=847.9000000000001s)]
*  However, there are emergency powers available to the president that are disturbingly broad and that lack checks and balances that are necessary to ensure that they can't be used in ways that could undermine our democracy in other ways. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=856.1s)]
*  So I think it is absolutely a legitimate cause for concern, something the January 6th committee should be looking at very closely. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=871.1s)]
*  One of the key points of any congressional investigation, sort of a point almost literally, one of the key aims, one of the key reasons to justify creating congressional investigations is to recommend legislative changes, since that, after all, is the main purview of Congress. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=878.3000000000001s)]
*  If the January 6 investigators are looking at this, obviously it's going to potentially reveal more to us about what the components were of the plot and who was trying to get away with what. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=898.5s)]
*  But is it conceivable to you as an expert in this field that they could also recommend practical changes that the Congress itself could fix ahead of the 2024 election to alleviate some of the concerns that you're just describing? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=907.5s)]
*  Absolutely. Let's take the National Emergencies Act, which allows the president to declare a national emergency pretty much within his discretion just by signing an executive order. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=919.7s)]
*  And then that declaration unlocks enhanced powers that are contained in more than 120 different laws. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=929.7s)]
*  Some of those powers are what keep me awake at night, including laws that would allow the president to take over or shut down communications facilities, laws that would allow the president to freeze a meeting. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=935.7s)]
*  And freeze Americans assets and prevent anyone from doing any kind of financial transaction with them. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=948.9000000000001s)]
*  Laws that even allow the president to suspend the prohibition on government testing of chemical and biological agents on unwitting human subjects. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=954.9000000000001s)]
*  There are emergency powers that allow these things. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=963.9000000000001s)]
*  So absolutely, I think Congress should be thinking about ways to bring in some of these emergency powers, but also the very basic check that Congress should be able to shut down an abuse of emergency powers by the president. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=966.1s)]
*  And right now, the only way Congress can do that is to pass a law by a veto-proof supermajority. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=981.1s)]
*  And there are better ways to do it, such as allowing an emergency declaration to stay in effect for 30 days, but to terminate at that point. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=986.1s)]
*  If Congress hasn't approved the declaration, and that's part of some legislation that's been considered by Congress now. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=994.3000000000001s)]
*  One other law that I think is important to look at is the Insurrection Act. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1000.3000000000001s)]
*  And this is a law that allows the president, again, with a tremendous amount of discretion, to deploy federal troops to act as a domestic police force. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1004.3000000000001s)]
*  And that is something that in general, our laws, our Constitution really frown on that because the founders knew that an army turned inward can quickly become an instrument of tyranny. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1013.5s)]
*  But this law, the Insurrection Act, is really an exception. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1024.5s)]
*  It gives the president tremendous discretion to deploy troops to address not only insurrections, as the name would suggest, but also to address domestic violence, which isn't defined, to address unlawful combinations or conspiracies. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1027.5s)]
*  Again, not defined. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1042.7s)]
*  So this very vague and frankly archaic language of the statute hasn't been updated in 150 years. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1044.7s)]
*  It gives the president a dangerous amount of authority. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1052.7s)]
*  Again, what it means is more specific definitions and checks and balances. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1054.7s)]
*  Some provision for Congress and the courts to step in if the president overreaches. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1058.7s)]
*  Over the weekend, Republicans in Michigan chose their candidates for statewide office in November. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1064.7s)]
*  These will be the Republican candidates in Michigan for Secretary of State and Attorney General. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1069.9s)]
*  One of those two candidates, the one on the left, spoke at a QAnon conspiracy theorist conference, conspiracy theory conference, late last year. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1074.9s)]
*  She's now the official Republican Party nominee to be Secretary of State in Michigan, which means she'll be in charge of overseeing elections for the whole state if she wins in November. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1081.9s)]
*  That prospect is especially frightening in a state like Michigan. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1090.9s)]
*  You might remember that during the last presidential election, Michigan's Republican Party came within centimeters of not certifying Biden's election victory, even though he clearly won in Michigan and by a lot. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1094.1000000000001s)]
*  In the end, it came down to just one Republican member of a Michigan state canvassing board who resisted tons of pressure from his own party that he should agree to overturn the election results. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1106.1000000000001s)]
*  He voted to certify Joe Biden's victory. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1117.1000000000001s)]
*  Michigan Republicans then decided to retaliate against him. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1120.1000000000001s)]
*  They refused to let him keep that job on that state canvassing board. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1123.3s)]
*  They replaced him with a new Republican, a conservative activist named Tony Daunt. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1126.3s)]
*  Well, today, Mr. Daunt, that conservative activist who Michigan Republicans specifically chose for that key election post today, he resigned from his position in the Michigan Republican Party. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1131.3s)]
*  He wrote a letter to party leaders that was obtained by the Detroit News. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1141.3s)]
*  In it, he wrote that, quote, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1144.5s)]
*  Cowardly party leaders have made the election here in Michigan a test of who is the most cravenly loyal to Donald Trump and to relitigating the results of the 2020 cycle. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1146.7s)]
*  Incredibly, rather than distancing themselves from this undisciplined loser, far too many Republican leaders have decided that encouraging his delusional lies and even worse, cynically appeasing him despite knowing they are lies. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1156.7s)]
*  Whether it's misguided true beliefs, cynical cowardice, or just plain old grift and avarice, it is a losing strategy and I cannot serve on the governing board of a party that is too stupid to see that. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1169.9s)]
*  Trouble and turmoil in lots of Republican parties, in lots of swing states. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iv3Xu7rk08&t=1183.9s)]
