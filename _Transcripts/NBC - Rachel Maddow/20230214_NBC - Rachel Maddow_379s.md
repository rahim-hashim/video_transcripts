# Authoritarian style attacks on judiciary expected as potential Trump indictment looms
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU)
*  These protests in Israel today are because the far-right leader there has just proposed, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=0.0s)]
*  effectively, that he's going to take over the judiciary. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=7.16s)]
*  He says the courts in his country are, in his words, quote, out of control, and the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  courts need to be controlled. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=16.96s)]
*  And so his party is now advancing legislation in which he will control the courts, just [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=19.2s)]
*  like Viktor Orban did in Hungary. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=25.28s)]
*  Because, of course, an independent judiciary is just as necessary to a democracy as it [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=28.18s)]
*  is anathema to a leader with authoritarian designs. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=32.74s)]
*  Now, the personal context here in Israel is that the prime minister who's trying to do [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=37.3s)]
*  this is personally facing serious corruption charges in the courts. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=43.9s)]
*  So of course he thinks the courts are out of control and they must be brought under [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  his purview. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  And that's also why you see the protests saying things like, crime minister and no one is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=54.42s)]
*  above the law. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=58.74s)]
*  They see the authoritarian would-be leader of Israel, right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=61.02s)]
*  That's their accusation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=65.7s)]
*  They see him as essentially moving to get rid of the independent judiciary in that country, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=67.38s)]
*  both to consolidate his own power and to save himself from his own legal liability. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=73.7s)]
*  And he's putting that pillar of democracy on the chopping block, both because he wishes [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=81.38s)]
*  to put it on the chopping block, but also because it serves him personally in a very [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=86.7s)]
*  short-term and transactional way. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=90.58s)]
*  That's what has led to all the protests. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=93.86s)]
*  That's what has led to the accusations of creeping authoritarianism from that leader [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=95.46s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=99.74s)]
*  And again, I do think it's easier to see these things when they are far away from us, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=100.74s)]
*  right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=106.5s)]
*  The more similar they look between all these disparate other countries as they, you know, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=107.66s)]
*  slough off democracy one after the other with or without a fight in the streets. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=112.74s)]
*  But it's also for us at home, I think it is worth us watching it in other countries [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=117.98s)]
*  to learn the pattern, but also to recognize the signs that we're not immune. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=123.5s)]
*  Because in this country, our most prominent far-right leader has been, of course, subjected [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=128.46s)]
*  to multiple criminal and counterintelligence investigations by the FBI and the U.S. Justice [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=135.14s)]
*  Department. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=139.82s)]
*  And so we have seen and we have gobbled over the past several years as he started waging [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=140.82s)]
*  and then escalated and escalated and escalated further his attacks on the Justice Department [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=145.61999999999998s)]
*  and on the FBI in particular, to the point where not just him, but his party now considers [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=151.42s)]
*  the FBI effectively to be an enemy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=156.7s)]
*  And they attack it at every turn. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=159.06s)]
*  And they're talking about defunding the FBI. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  They talk about wanting its leaders arrested. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=163.14s)]
*  I mean, that has been amazing enough for something to happen in American politics. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=165.14s)]
*  It still almost feels like it's something we're watching happening in another country. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=169.22s)]
*  These Trump mega Republican attacks on the FBI and the Justice Department. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=173.02s)]
*  As Trump has been under investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department, he has trained [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=179.7s)]
*  his sights on the FBI and the Justice Department. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=184.38s)]
*  But where is that going? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=189.18s)]
*  Because we now know that three days from now, on Thursday of this week, former president [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=190.46s)]
*  and current presidential candidate Donald Trump, as of Thursday this week, is likely [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  to understand that he's no longer just facing scrutiny and investigation from law enforcement [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=204.70000000000002s)]
*  agencies. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  He is likely, not certain, but likely to find out this week that he's about to be under [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=210.82s)]
*  court scrutiny as well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=216.70000000000002s)]
*  Today, a judge in Georgia announced that the special grand jury investigating Trump's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=220.38s)]
*  efforts to stay in power after losing reelection in 2020, the report on the special grand jury's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=223.82s)]
*  investigation into that matter, which is meant to inform the prosecutor's decisions about [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=229.54s)]
*  seeking indictments in that case, that grand jury report is about to be partially unsealed [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=234.9s)]
*  for the public. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=239.74s)]
*  And we're going to talk about the details of that in just a minute because they're [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=242.74s)]
*  important. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  But the bottom line is a big picture story for our democracy. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Trump may not find himself being charged in Georgia, just as he may not find himself [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=251.38s)]
*  being charged in New York State, where a grand jury is investigating him as well. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=256.14s)]
*  He may not find himself being charged in federal court in Washington, where multiple grand [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=259.78s)]
*  juries are investigating him now, too. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=263.9s)]
*  It's possible he won't face charges in any of these places, right? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=266.98s)]
*  But if he is, that process of us adjusting to that as a democracy is about to start now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=270.65999999999997s)]
*  Because the first grand jury we are going to hear from substantively is the one in [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=278.16s)]
*  Georgia and we are going to hear from them this week. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=281.72s)]
*  And if you thought it was a bad look for our American version of one of these guys to be [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  attacking the press for challenging him, to be attacking the FBI and the Justice Department [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=289.0s)]
*  for investigating him, what's around the corner for us as a democracy if he is indicted? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  What's around the corner for us if he is indicted is an attack on the specific system that now [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  poses the threat to him, the specific system that holds the power to indict him, to potentially [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=308.04s)]
*  arrest him, to put him in court, to put him on trial? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=315.24s)]
*  It is one thing to invade against the people investigating you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  What do you do when the court compels you to do something? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=323.76000000000005s)]
*  Do you attack that system with the same vehemence and with the same willingness to burn down [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  one of the pillars of our democracy? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=334.04s)]
*  I mean, all around the world we know what it looks like when far-right leaders try to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=337.04s)]
*  disassemble those kinds of systems in order to assert and protect and maintain total power [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=341.92s)]
*  for themselves. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  We have never had to contend with that here. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=347.92s)]
*  We have a lot to learn quickly about how we are going to shore those things up so they [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=352.36s)]
*  stay standing about what is very likely coming. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DlTtQEzEEU&t=356.12s)]
