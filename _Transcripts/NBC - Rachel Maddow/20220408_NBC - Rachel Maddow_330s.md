# Putin's Information War Drives Wedge Through Cross-Border Families
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg)
*  We've talked a lot on this show about the fact that Vladimir Putin's government is hiding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=0.0s)]
*  the truth of what's going on here in Ukraine from everyday Russian citizens. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=4.34s)]
*  Just yesterday we heard the Kremlin spokesman say that the photos and the videos of the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=8.76s)]
*  atrocities in Bukha and other Ukrainian cities were all fake, staged by Ukraine and the West [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=13.1s)]
*  to make Russia look bad. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=19.8s)]
*  We also know that independent journalists within Russia cannot even call this war a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=21.6s)]
*  war without fear of potentially facing up to 15 years in prison. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=26.64s)]
*  So what does that all mean for people in Ukraine who have family back in Russia or in Russian-occupied [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=31.84s)]
*  Crimea? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=38.18s)]
*  Their loved ones are hearing things from the Kremlin and state-run media that simply don't [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=39.28s)]
*  line up with the reality of what they're living through in real time. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=42.78s)]
*  I spoke to a few young people in this country about how the facts of this war are affecting [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  their relationships with their immediate family. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=51.540000000000006s)]
*  You're living in a war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=55.0s)]
*  And you talk to your mother, who's not here, and you have difficulty having this conversation [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=57.56s)]
*  with her. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=62.8s)]
*  Tell me why. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=63.8s)]
*  Because she lives in Russia and she, she watch Russian TV and she says that she doesn't believe [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=64.8s)]
*  that it's Russian troops are here and that they are bombing our cities and killing our [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=78.4s)]
*  people. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=88.12s)]
*  So that's why. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=91.38000000000001s)]
*  So what does she believe? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=92.38000000000001s)]
*  Who does she think is bombing? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  I think she doesn't. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=96.48s)]
*  She doesn't know where is the truth. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=100.92s)]
*  So how do those conversations go with you? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=103.96s)]
*  Because you're in this war, you're frightened, she doesn't really believe that what's going [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=106.32s)]
*  on is happening. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=111.96s)]
*  So what do you talk about? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=113.16s)]
*  She tries to talk about something else about, not about war. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  She tries to ask me about my health, about our weather and other stuff. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=120.91999999999999s)]
*  And I don't like it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Who have you got in your family who sees this differently? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=132.26s)]
*  So the war started in 2014. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=136.06s)]
*  And we have our relatives from here who moved to Russia, who lived in Russia, but they were [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=140.14s)]
*  living and studying here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  They're mixed. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=150.54s)]
*  So the part of the family is from Russia, part of the family who is here, but they now [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=151.54s)]
*  live in Russia. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=156.32s)]
*  So in 2014 and 2015, where all of the war started, they were calling us asking what's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=158.3s)]
*  happening. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  So we told them about the revolution that we would like to be in the EU, that we don't [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  want to be part of Russia. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=170.5s)]
*  We are not one nation. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  And then we just had a conversation very impolite way. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=174.34s)]
*  They're telling us that we are stupid, that you are idiots. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=178.38000000000002s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=182.38000000000002s)]
*  How much US paid you to vote for Poroshenko? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=183.38000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=187.34s)]
*  In 2014. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=188.34s)]
*  And has anything improved in terms of those relationships since 2014 or has it gotten [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=190.7s)]
*  worse now? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=194.58s)]
*  It's gotten worse. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=196.38s)]
*  We don't talk to them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=197.38s)]
*  Where are your parents right now? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=199.42s)]
*  Our parents are in Simferopol, Crimea. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=201.38s)]
*  And tell me about how this conversation about this war goes with your parents. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=204.06s)]
*  Yeah, so we have difficult conversations since 2014. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=209.46s)]
*  We disagree on a lot of things. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=215.98s)]
*  But at that point, we could tell them more political debates because none of us was directly [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=221.38s)]
*  impacted by the war. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=227.89999999999998s)]
*  So we can just like, OK, we have different opinions. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=229.62s)]
*  We just have to accept this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=232.42s)]
*  So we have sort of taboo on certain topics, not to raise them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=234.82s)]
*  It not always worked. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=242.89999999999998s)]
*  We had many fights and argued a lot. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=244.56s)]
*  And on 24th of February this year, when the full scale invasion started, we just received [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=249.12s)]
*  a text from mom, like, how's it going, if we are alive. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=255.36s)]
*  And we were really busy fleeing from Kiev at that time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=261.2s)]
*  Then once we arrived, I have never had a real conversation with my mom. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=264.12s)]
*  She is the most pro-Putin in our family. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=268.44s)]
*  And I think she also understands that the conversation now can harm both of us. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  Speaking about my father, who has more moderate views, and he is somehow able to de-escalate [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  the situation, he is able to accept multiple points of view. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=286.28s)]
*  But he again, as Christina mentioned, tries to avoid any hot topics. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=290.88s)]
*  Difficult conversations and a reminder of why it's so important that the rest of the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=302.84s)]
*  world sees what is truly happening here in Ukraine. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8lKdzVjCqg&t=306.24s)]
