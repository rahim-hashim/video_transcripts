# Giuliani, Other 'Clownish' Trump Allies, Subpoenaed In January 6th Investigation
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM)
*  But that was not even the craziest press conference Mr. Giuliani gave that month. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=0.0s)]
*  Just over a week later, he held another one, which would also go down in political history [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=4.46s)]
*  for something entirely unrelated to the spoken content of the event. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=7.78s)]
*  I'm talking, of course, about the What's That on His Face presser, the press conference [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=11.46s)]
*  at which Trump lawyer Mr. Giuliani appeared to be sort of melting before our eyes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=15.8s)]
*  I know that is what you remember about that event. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=22.48s)]
*  None of us can ever forget it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=25.98s)]
*  What was that event for, of Event to Haunt Our Dreams till we're dead? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=29.12s)]
*  That event, ostensibly, was supposed to be a formal presentation by Rudy Giuliani and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=32.339999999999996s)]
*  his legal team about how the election had been stolen from Trump. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=37.72s)]
*  Giuliani told reporters at the Hair Die press conference that Trump had won Pennsylvania [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=42.16s)]
*  by 300,000 votes and Michigan by 50,000 votes, and he could absolutely prove it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=46.68s)]
*  I mean, not that he had the evidence right then to show reporters that day, but he would [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=52.04s)]
*  have the evidence soon and everybody should get ready. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=55.7s)]
*  Evidence of all the corruption by the big city Democrats. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  He said he knew crimes were committed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=61.660000000000004s)]
*  He could smell them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=63.74s)]
*  Another member of Trump's legal team, Sidney Powell, then took the podium and explained, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=67.66s)]
*  if you can call it that, that the election had been stolen by communists in Venezuela, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=72.58s)]
*  also Cuba, also China, and the voting machines had been hacked by Hugo Chavez, even though [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=77.7s)]
*  he's dead. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=83.62s)]
*  But trust us, it works out. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=84.66000000000001s)]
*  Another Trump lawyer, Jenna Ellis, then got up and yelled at the media, who were all there [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=87.26s)]
*  to cover their allegations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=91.22s)]
*  She yelled at them for not covering their allegations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=92.86s)]
*  Also joining them on stage at that event was a Trump campaign advisor named Boris, Boris [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  Epstein. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=101.14s)]
*  It was the gentleman spot shadowed there on the right side of your screen. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=102.14s)]
*  I'm pointing out all these folks because this evening that whole crew from that Cuckoo for [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=106.94s)]
*  Cocoa Puffs press conference, all four of them, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=110.58000000000001s)]
*  Ellis and Boris Epstein, they have all been subpoenaed by the January 6 investigation [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=114.1s)]
*  in Congress. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=118.94s)]
*  All four have been directed to produce documents to the investigation by the first of next [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=120.1s)]
*  month. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=125.33999999999999s)]
*  They've all been ordered to appear for depositions a week later. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=126.33999999999999s)]
*  Because as ridiculous as their quasi legal efforts seemed at the time, as ridiculous [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=131.14s)]
*  as they seem even now in retrospect, the January 6 investigation is subpoenaing them, not because [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=136.45999999999998s)]
*  there a joke, but quite the contrary. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=142.78s)]
*  I mean, from the perspective of the investigation, these clownish folks were allegedly involved [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=144.94s)]
*  in the very worst of what was being plotted to overthrow the government and keep Trump [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=151.86s)]
*  in power even after he lost the election. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=156.02s)]
*  As with so many things related to the Trump era Republican Party, it's sort of simultaneously [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=159.86s)]
*  a clown show and a deadly serious threat. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=166.18s)]
*  Giuliani and the rest, these guys technically were Trump's legal team and they did bring [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=170.10000000000002s)]
*  a number of lawsuits alleging election fraud and malfeasance and they were laughed out [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  of court at every turn. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=179.5s)]
*  In fact, Sidney Powell, the one with the communist plot by dead Hugo Chavez, she was actually [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=181.66000000000003s)]
*  sanctioned by one court and referred for possible disbarment by the judge because the election [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=187.34s)]
*  lawsuit she brought before that court was so baseless and full of obvious lies. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=191.66000000000003s)]
*  Mr. Giuliani has had his own trouble with his own legal license around these same matters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=196.98s)]
*  But it doesn't appear that the January 6 investigation is subpoenaing this group because [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=202.5s)]
*  it's interested directly in those legal efforts such as they were. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=206.62s)]
*  Judging by the letters accompanying the subpoenas tonight, the investigation is interested in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=209.94s)]
*  Mr. Giuliani and the legal team because of the ways those guys supported and facilitated [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=214.06s)]
*  the broader plot to try to overturn the election even beyond the courts. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=219.1s)]
*  I'll show you what I mean. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=224.01999999999998s)]
*  This is from the letter to Mr. Giuliani tonight. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=224.82s)]
*  Remember, disrupting or delaying the certification of the results on January 6, that became the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=241.73999999999998s)]
*  main goal of Trump and his allies, if nothing else so they could buy time to overturn the election. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=247.06s)]
*  Either through the courts or more likely, given how the legal challenges were going [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=253.14s)]
*  by the dozen, more likely some other way. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=257.26s)]
*  The letters from the investigation tonight specifically mentioned Mr. Giuliani's attempts, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=261.53999999999996s)]
*  often accompanied by Jenna Ellis, to convince Republican state legislators that they should [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=265.62s)]
*  falsify the election results in their states and say Trump won when he didn't. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=270.78s)]
*  He did this road show in the weeks after the election trying to get Republican legislators [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=275.09999999999997s)]
*  and swing states to declare the election invalid and instead send slates of Trump [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=278.72s)]
*  electors to Congress. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  The investigation also claims to have witness testimony about Mr. Giuliani, quote, urging [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=286.88000000000005s)]
*  President Trump to direct the seizure of voting machines around the country after being told [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  that the Department of Homeland Security had no lawful authority to do so. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=296.88000000000005s)]
*  Also, quote, according to public reporting on January 6th and the days prior, you were [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=300.6s)]
*  in contact. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  This is the letter to Mr. Giuliani. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  You were in contact with then President Trump and members of Congress regarding strategies [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=308.3s)]
*  for delaying or overturning the results of the 2020 election. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=311.7s)]
*  We know that Mr. Giuliani was on the phone with Republican U.S. senators on January 6th, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=317.14s)]
*  even after the mob had stormed the Capitol, still trying to get them to stop or delay [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=322.3s)]
*  the certification of the election. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=326.52s)]
*  They were still that night, even after the mob attack on the Capitol, trying to find [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=328.5s)]
*  a way to falsify the election results and keep Trump in power. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=332.54s)]
*  The investigation's letter to Jenna Ellis specifically mentions two legal memos she [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=338.3s)]
*  prepared purporting to explain how Vice President Pence should reject or delay accepting the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=342.09999999999997s)]
*  electoral votes from certain states, states that had submitted alternate slates of electors, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=348.0s)]
*  false slates of electors. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=353.7s)]
*  They never did succeed in getting Republican state legislatures and states Joe Biden won [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=357.3s)]
*  to send in official alternate slates of electors for Trump. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=362.58s)]
*  And as we have been reporting on this show, nevertheless, Republicans in multiple states [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=365.9s)]
*  did sign forged documents claiming to be the real electors for their state, claiming that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=370.09999999999997s)]
*  they were the duly elected electors from their state and that Trump had won, which was all [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=375.02s)]
*  bullpucky and may be prosecuted in multiple jurisdictions now as a crime. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=379.58s)]
*  But it all appears to have been part of the same broad plan. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=385.78s)]
*  And the Trump allies subpoenaed today were, according to the investigation, all over every [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=388.85999999999996s)]
*  aspect of it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=393.82s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis trying to get state legislators to falsify the election [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=395.41999999999996s)]
*  results in the states. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=399.29999999999995s)]
*  Is Ellis writing legal justifications for Vice President Pence to overturn the results [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=400.85999999999996s)]
*  and not accept the electoral count? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=405.73999999999995s)]
*  If that didn't work, Giuliani and Sidney Powell were trying to get President Trump to seize [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=408.7s)]
*  voting machines around the country and overturn the election himself with some sort of claims [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=412.97999999999996s)]
*  of military or executive power. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  Boris Epstein was at the Willard Hotel at the so-called command center on January 6th, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  allegedly talking by phone with President Trump about how they could stop certifying [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=424.1s)]
*  the election that day. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=428.06s)]
*  Somehow, one way or another, they were determined to make it happen. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=429.34s)]
*  And so it's no surprise that the January 6th investigation wants to talk to them, plans [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=435.26s)]
*  to compel them to talk by subpoena. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjXVQaf1_FM&t=440.65999999999997s)]
