# Settlement with separated migrant families marks step in closing shameful Trump-era chapter for U.S.
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs)
*  Here's something that I think should have received more attention than it has. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=0.0s)]
*  Among the many things the House of Representatives can't do right now because Republicans can't [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  elect even one of their own number as speaker, among the things the House can't do is it [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=10.92s)]
*  can't take up President Biden's request for money for Ukraine and Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=15.72s)]
*  There is a third part of that funding request though, which is languishing, that has gotten [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=21.2s)]
*  a little less attention. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=27.42s)]
*  The funding request that's on the table right now includes several billion dollars for security [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=29.2s)]
*  at America's southern border, as well as services for immigrants who are already here and who [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=33.32s)]
*  are awaiting immigration hearings. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  While that money depends on congressional Republicans getting their act together though, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  there is one change to America's immigration system that is set to go ahead regardless [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  of whether or not they ever get their act together. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=51.28s)]
*  It's because it's coming through the courts. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=54.32s)]
*  A settlement between the federal government and the American Civil Liberties Union, the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=56.6s)]
*  ACLU, looks like it is finally going to bring at least some closure to one of the darkest [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=60.52s)]
*  chapters of the Donald J. Trump presidential administration, one of the darkest chapters [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=66.12s)]
*  of our moral lives in this generation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=71.0s)]
*  You will recall that under the Trump administration's so-called zero tolerance immigration policy, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=75.48s)]
*  we saw thousands of little kids separated from their moms and dads, taken out of their [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=80.4s)]
*  mom and dad's arms. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=85.72s)]
*  The children were put into government custody while many of the parents were deported or [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=88.84s)]
*  prosecuted according to the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=92.4s)]
*  Even though there's been a Biden administration task force from day one that has been working [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=95.32s)]
*  on this, as of at least a few months ago, roughly a thousand kids still have not been [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=98.92s)]
*  reunited with their families. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=104.44s)]
*  And this is due in large part to the fact that the Trump administration, while they [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=107.48s)]
*  were taking all these kids away from their moms and dads, they did not bother to keep [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  track of which parents went with which kids and where different family members were sent. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=114.48s)]
*  But now, if this new settlement is signed off on by a federal judge, family separation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  will formally be banned in this country. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  The settlement also provides for support services for those who were separated from their families [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=131.24s)]
*  when Trump was president, including things like housing and medical care and behavioral [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=136.4s)]
*  health benefits, which you might expect they will need for these immigrant families dealing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  with the trauma of the U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=146.27999999999997s)]
*  government coming in and taking away the kids from their parents. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=147.6s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland said this about the settlement. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  He said, quote, The practice of separating families at the southwest border was shameful. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  This agreement will facilitate the reunification of separated families and provide them with [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  critical services to aid in their recovery. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=163.48s)]
*  Again, it still needs to be approved by a federal judge. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=168.2s)]
*  But you know, this is a a moral wound that can never really be healed. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=170.76s)]
*  This happened in your family. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=178.48s)]
*  It will have multi-generation consequences. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  But but at least this, right, at least this thing, which we all lived through, that we [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=184.56s)]
*  can never forget happened in our country and all in our time in which we are therefore [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  all at some level required to morally answer for at least this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=192.72s)]
*  At least we're finally starting to find this up and to fix it at last. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKo6Hb77aCs&t=199.36s)]
