# Meadows takes risk with surprise testimony that has potential to backfire
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI)
*  Joining us now is Chuck Rosenberg, former U.S. Attorney, former senior FBI official. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=0.0s)]
*  Chuck, it's great to see you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=4.08s)]
*  Thanks for being here tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=5.36s)]
*  My pleasure, Rachel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=6.36s)]
*  What do we know about how Mark Meadows did today, how good his case is that his trial [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=7.36s)]
*  should be moved to federal court? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=14.24s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a three-part Supreme Court test that's important that I want to talk [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=15.84s)]
*  to you about. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=21.52s)]
*  In order to get plucked out of state court, as you described, he would have to show that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  he was a federal official. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=29.08s)]
*  He was. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=30.52s)]
*  That part's easy. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=31.52s)]
*  That he was acting within the scope of his federal authority. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  That part's hard. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=35.8s)]
*  And the third piece, Rachel, that he would have a colorable federal defense if the case [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=37.4s)]
*  were moved from state to federal court. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=43.4s)]
*  And at least for this stage of the proceedings, that part's pretty easy. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=45.16s)]
*  So let's focus on number two. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=48.72s)]
*  Was he acting within the scope of his federal authority? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=49.96s)]
*  I think that's a hard thing for him to show. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Chiefs of staff do lots of things, and the chief of staff to a president, of course, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=57.0s)]
*  does lots of things. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=62.0s)]
*  But this was a political effort to thwart a fair and free election. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  And if Mr. Meadows is going to get tripped up over anything, it's this notion that he [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=69.72s)]
*  was acting within the scope of his federal authority. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=75.8s)]
*  So he has a plausible claim. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=78.36s)]
*  It's not a frivolous claim, but I think the judge is going to be skeptical that he meets [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=81.16s)]
*  that second prong to show that he was acting in the scope of his federal authority. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=86.02s)]
*  Chuck, why is it that every smart lawyer in the country looking at the news today said [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  that it was shocking that Mark Meadows decided to take the stand and testify, let alone for [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=97.02s)]
*  five hours in this hearing? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=102.89999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, simply because he didn't have to, Rachel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=105.58s)]
*  His side could have tried to meet their burden of proof, and it was their burden of proof [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=109.69999999999999s)]
*  today by putting in affidavits or calling other witnesses. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=113.98s)]
*  But remember, he's a defendant in a criminal case, and so anything he says can be used [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=118.22s)]
*  against him in that case. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=123.58000000000001s)]
*  That's pretty treacherous. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=125.38000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's one thing for him to answer questions from his own attorneys. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  That could be scripted. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=130.70000000000002s)]
*  That could be prepped. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  That could be tested. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=132.70000000000002s)]
*  It's another thing for him to answer questions on cross-examination, which is precisely what [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=133.70000000000002s)]
*  happened. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=138.74s)]
*  So if prosecutors got something valuable from his testimony today, they could use it [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=139.74s)]
*  against him in a criminal trial. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=145.06s)]
*  That's what is surprising, that he took the stand at all when he actually didn't have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  to. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=151.94s)]
*  The hearing today did not end with the judge ruling on this motion. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=152.94s)]
*  The judge has to decide whether or not the case will be removed to federal court, which [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=157.5s)]
*  is what Mr. Meadows is seeking. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=160.62s)]
*  We'll get that ruling eventually from the judge. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=162.38s)]
*  If Mr. Meadows succeeds and the case does get moved to federal court, does that mean [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=164.78s)]
*  ultimately at the end of the day the whole case is going to get moved to federal court, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=169.94s)]
*  that all of the other defendants will benefit in the same way that he's trying to here? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=173.98s)]
*  Great question. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  And I don't think you have enough time in the show for me to explain all of the possibilities, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  Rachel. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=185.38s)]
*  But there's two answers, yes and no. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=186.46s)]
*  There's one school of thought that said the other 18 defendants go if Mr. Meadows goes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=190.38s)]
*  If one goes, they all go, to put it simply. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  There's another school of thought, and I think this is probably more likely, that you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=198.26s)]
*  would determine what happens to each defendant on his or her own merits. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=203.34s)]
*  Remember, some of them are not even federal officials. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=208.94s)]
*  Some of them wouldn't have any plausible, colorable federal defense in federal court. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=212.12s)]
*  So it makes more sense to me that you would determine each one on his or her own merits. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=218.62s)]
*  That seems fair. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  A random state senator or a publicist for a rapper, at least at this point in our country's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  history doesn't count as a federal official. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWj-TKR-lNI&t=230.98000000000002s)]
