# Nashville students walk out, demand gun safety legislation
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8)
*  At 10 13 a.m. today, 10 13 a.m. exactly, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=0.0s)]
*  kids in Nashville, Tennessee all walked out of their classes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=6.2s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=9.72s)]
*  10 13 a.m. is when the first Help Me 911 calls [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=12.36s)]
*  started coming into the police department in Nashville [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=16.84s)]
*  one week ago today. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=19.52s)]
*  Monday last week when that horrific school shooting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=21.32s)]
*  started unfolding at the Covenant School, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  an elementary school in that city. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=26.72s)]
*  Police today said that in the roughly 14 minutes [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=29.2s)]
*  that it took for that school shooting to elapse, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=32.88s)]
*  the shooter fired 126 rifle rounds [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=36.92s)]
*  and 26 rounds from a handgun. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=40.76s)]
*  152 rounds altogether in 14 minutes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=43.32s)]
*  To honor the three little kids and the three school staff [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=49.7s)]
*  who were murdered in their school Monday last week [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=53.46s)]
*  and to demand legal change to stop gun violence, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=57.8s)]
*  literally thousands of Tennessee students [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=61.16s)]
*  walked out of their classes today. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=63.959999999999994s)]
*  And at some schools they left their classrooms [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=67.24s)]
*  and they rallied outside their school. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=70.64s)]
*  That happened at a whole bunch [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=72.82s)]
*  of different schools in Tennessee. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=73.84s)]
*  At some schools today they did a walk in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  instead of a walk out, meaning they left class, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  but then they came together in a school auditorium [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=81.72s)]
*  to talk about the problem. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=84.32s)]
*  But by the thousands, what the students did today [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=86.64s)]
*  in Tennessee is they went to the Tennessee State Capitol [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  in Nashville. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  Look at these images, this is today. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  Now you might've seen in the news last week [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  that Thursday last week, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=99.2s)]
*  a lot of kids in Nashville did the same. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=100.54s)]
*  Last week, Tennessee kids crowded into the galleries [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=102.56s)]
*  overlooking the State House floor calling for gun reforms. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=105.56s)]
*  That was Thursday last week. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=109.72s)]
*  Today they rallied on the State Capitol steps in Nashville [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  and then in huge numbers, they lined up, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=116.48s)]
*  they went through security and they just poured [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=118.64s)]
*  into the hallways of the State Capitol. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=121.36s)]
*  At one point mounting a kind of sit-in outside the offices [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=124.12s)]
*  of the Republican House Speaker. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=127.44s)]
*  The same House Speaker today stripped [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=130.06s)]
*  two Democratic legislators of their committee assignments [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=133.94s)]
*  and threatened to expel three Democratic state legislatures [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=137.32s)]
*  from the state legislature altogether, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=142.2s)]
*  threatening to throw them out of the state legislature [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=144.04s)]
*  because those three Democratic state legislators [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=146.52s)]
*  joined with the kids who protested [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=149.44s)]
*  from the galleries last week. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=151.44s)]
*  Well, tonight those kids are back at the State Capitol [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=154.04s)]
*  and joining them are apparently a bunch of parents [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=156.96s)]
*  who have their little kids in tow with them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=160.4s)]
*  And apparently they are planning to stay through [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=163.8s)]
*  this evening's legislative sessions in Nashville [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=165.64s)]
*  at the State Capitol in Tennessee. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=169.84s)]
*  We're keeping eyes on Nashville tonight [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=171.24s)]
*  as that story continues to unfold. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=173.6s)]
*  Just some remarkable images today out of Tennessee. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjd1g6wPRi8&t=175.48s)]
