# Russia Expected To Split Ukraine In Initial Military Campaign
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8)
*  We saw Richard Engels reporting from earlier today in Mariupol, which is roughly right here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  It is in part of this disputed area that the Russians have now recognized. The Russians have [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=5.76s)]
*  recognized two oblasts. These are, for lack of a better word, provinces, Donetsk and Luhansk. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=11.28s)]
*  Both Donetsk and Luhansk have cities in the center of them called the same thing, Donetsk and Luhansk. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=18.0s)]
*  The area here in pink is the area that separatists have controlled for some time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=23.92s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is not concerning himself with the actual information here. He has declared [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=28.88s)]
*  both of these provinces or oblasts as Russian territory, and this is where he claims to be [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=33.36s)]
*  sending peacekeepers. There are 190,000 troops amassed all over here. This is the Russian border, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  but this is Belarus, which is a pro-Russian independent country, and there are Russian troops [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=45.04s)]
*  all the way through Belarus. This border at this side of Belarus, this is Poland. This is all NATO [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=50.4s)]
*  over here. This is where, as far as NATO troops go, there are no NATO troops in Belarus, obviously. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=57.04s)]
*  There are no NATO troops in Russia, and there are no NATO troops in Ukraine. So this is the situation [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=62.16s)]
*  as it seems right now. Let's go to Courtney Cubie, NBC News correspondent at the Pentagon. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=67.12s)]
*  Courtney, there's a lot of information going on right here, but what we're not really clear on is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  what a Russian offensive would look like in this environment. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=79.92s)]
*  So according to a U.S. military and U.S. intelligence assessment, if you look at that map [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=85.92s)]
*  right behind you, Ali, if you take a line and you draw it straight from Kiev straight down to Odessa [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=91.12s)]
*  and then all the way up to the border with Belarus, everything east of there, the assumption is that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  in this initial phase or tranche of this military campaign, that that would be the target area. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=104.16s)]
*  So right now, Russia, you mentioned that there's somewhere in the neighborhood, 150,000 to 190,000 [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=112.0s)]
*  Russian troops all around that area, primarily around what we're looking at the map here, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=117.36s)]
*  Kharkiv, the eastern side of the two breakaway areas, all the way down to the southern part. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=122.08s)]
*  Then there's also a large grouping of Russian troops in the north. There's a little town called [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=128.4s)]
*  Klintse that's just north on the other side of the border from Belarus and then over into Belarus. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=133.68s)]
*  There are a number of expected routes that Russia will take if they conduct this large-scale invasion [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=140.4s)]
*  that I have to say, Ali, the officials who I'm speaking with here at the Pentagon and elsewhere [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=149.12s)]
*  in this town believe that that is the decision that Vladimir Putin has made, that he will conduct [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  this large-scale invasion. It's just a matter of when they will. The plan is to start in the air, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=158.32s)]
*  according to this military assessment, US military assessment, start in the air, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=164.56s)]
*  air strikes, cruise missile strikes. There are a large number of Russian naval ships down in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=168.56s)]
*  Black Sea and in the Sea of Azov. They have cruise, they have missiles on them. They have the ability [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=172.88s)]
*  to launch into that area in the first 45 minutes to one hour of this initial phase of this, of this [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=177.76s)]
*  military campaign. They can take out a large amount of the Ukrainian military. Roughly 50% [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=185.28s)]
*  of the Ukrainian military and the most capable forces are in that area I laid out on the eastern [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=191.28s)]
*  half of the country. They can take out their ammunition, their lines of communication, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=196.16s)]
*  literally their ability to communicate with one another and to physically reach one another by [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=201.2s)]
*  taking out bridges and roadways. They will likely target their aircraft, Ukrainian military aircraft, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=206.24s)]
*  park up the runway so that they can't take out, they can't take off. They likely will take out [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=213.28s)]
*  their air defense systems. So essentially, if this is the way that Russia carries this out, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=217.84s)]
*  in the first hour or so, they will virtually cripple that half of the Ukrainian military there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=223.68s)]
*  They will own the airspace because they have air defense systems up in the north, in Belarus and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=230.72s)]
*  in the western part of Russia, that will virtually take over the airspace there. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=235.36s)]
*  Then after that initial air campaign, we'll see artillery fire coming across the border. And then [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=241.12s)]
*  after an hour, maybe two, a couple of hours in the early parts of this campaign, that was when, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=247.68s)]
*  is when we will most likely see Russian military forces rolling across the border into Ukraine. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=253.28s)]
*  So again, this is a U.S. military assessment, but it's based on what they have been seeing [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=259.12s)]
*  Russia do, build up across that border in the last several months, Ali. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=264.24s)]
*  I want to put that map up of the oblast, the provinces in eastern Ukraine just for a second, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=269.68s)]
*  because there are two points you're making here. One is by Vladimir Putin recognizing those two [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=276.16s)]
*  places as independent countries, it's not a justification accepted by anyone else in the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=280.88s)]
*  world, but there is an argument that he would make to say, hey, we're sending people in, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=285.36s)]
*  they've requested our presence to go into these two places and protect Russians over there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  But you're talking about things happening north of Kiev, coming out of Belarus or coming out of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=295.28s)]
*  Russia on the northern part. There's no global justification for going into an entirely [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  separate country. At that point, is Vladimir Putin prepared to just give up the pretext of the idea [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  that he's protecting Russian speakers over here and he's largely just going into Ukraine? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=311.2s)]
*  Yeah. So, I mean, he's actually been laying this out for months, for years, really. But in July, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  Vladimir Putin wrote this long op-ed, essentially, where he laid out everything that he wants to do. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=321.44s)]
*  Taking back Ukraine is not only a national security objective for Vladimir Putin, it is a long-term [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=328.16s)]
*  strategic goal. So the notion that he is going to base this on any kind of global or international [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=334.96s)]
*  norms or standards that most other countries in this world would adhere to, I think is not likely [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=341.44s)]
*  to be the case here. I think that he is doing this based off what he sees as his priorities [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=348.08s)]
*  and his objectives. This is a legacy item for him, something that he hopes will last longer than even [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  he is in power, however many more years that will be, in Russia. It's something that he sees [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  as a long-term goal. So most likely, he will focus on that area, the breakaway area, and beyond. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=362.88s)]
*  All the way up, there's a river that kind of cuts that from almost the eastern half of the country, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=370.79999999999995s)]
*  the Dnieper River. Most likely, he will focus on everything east of there. But I should point out, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=376.72s)]
*  the assessment is that he will then continue on to the western part of the country. So it's not as if [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  the belief is that he's just going to focus and almost build two Ukraine's or create two Ukraine's. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  The belief is that his goal is ultimately taking back the entire country. He will just focus on [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=393.44000000000005s)]
*  that eastern half in the beginning. And when they go in, the assessment is that he will encircle some [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=398.0s)]
*  of these large cities. Kiev, Kharkiv in the east, Odessa in the south, encircle them, isolate them, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=404.56s)]
*  cut them off, and then they will move from there. He has a tremendous amount of personnel arrayed [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=411.68s)]
*  around the border right now. It is enough for not only for the initial invasion, but for an occupation [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=418.4s)]
*  force for some time. All right. And I want to show you a little bit on the map here of what Kourtney [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=425.44s)]
*  was just talking about. Down here in Odessa, remember, Russia controls Crimea. It's got ships [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=430.0s)]
*  in here that can take care of Odessa. This is the river that Kourtney was just talking about, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=434.24s)]
*  the Dnieper River. It splits Kiev into east and west. This part was traditionally ruled over or [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=439.04s)]
*  influenced by Poland, this part by Russia, and it is Russia that's concentrating on controlling this [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=445.36s)]
*  side of Ukraine. Kourtney, thank you for that. We'll, of course, stay close to you. Kourtney [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=451.2s)]
*  QB at the Pentagon for us. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikl7qpH-AJ8&t=456.0s)]
