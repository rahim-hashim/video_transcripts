# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Oct. 10
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0)
*  So we are less than 30 days out now from the elections. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going to be joined in just a moment here by the man who is in charge of the Democratic [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=4.2s)]
*  Party's efforts to hold the United States Senate. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=8.58s)]
*  And that is quite a job this year. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=13.22s)]
*  The polling averages right now show that the prospects for both parties in the Senate are [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=15.14s)]
*  equal as of today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=20.36s)]
*  Literally, if what the polling says today ends up matching the vote on election day, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=22.2s)]
*  it will be 50-50 in the Senate. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=28.16s)]
*  So in terms of control of the Senate, control of the direction of the country, every race [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=31.16s)]
*  really matters. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=36.8s)]
*  Every seat really matters. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=38.08s)]
*  Every candidate really matters. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=39.54s)]
*  It is just on a knife's edge. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=41.0s)]
*  And I mean, just at a personal level, if you didn't know whether you're going to volunteer [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=44.6s)]
*  for a candidate yet this year, or if you were going to volunteer to door knocker or do some [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=49.1s)]
*  If you hadn't yet committed to just voting for sure yourself this year, this year, your [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=54.36s)]
*  vote really will matter. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=60.48s)]
*  This is not one to skip out on. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=62.339999999999996s)]
*  This election is going to be very tight and very, very interesting and very consequential. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=64.72s)]
*  Again, if the polling bears out and election day looks anything like the polls say it's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=70.2s)]
*  going to look today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=74.88s)]
*  Again, we'll be talking with the man in charge of the Democratic Party's efforts in the Senate [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=76.28s)]
*  in just a moment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=80.56s)]
*  Obviously a super high stakes job, super difficult job. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=82.12s)]
*  Still though, who would you rather be? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  Would you rather be the Senate guy for the Democrats right now? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=88.84s)]
*  Or would you rather be the Senate guy for the Republicans? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=92.38s)]
*  Who tomorrow has to go to the state of Georgia and say, yeah, hey, everybody vote for Herschel [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=95.76s)]
*  Walker. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Because when you look at Herschel Walker, take it from me. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  We want you to know that's what Republicans stand for. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=105.44s)]
*  And no, we will not be taking questions about the holding a gun to a woman's head thing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=108.82s)]
*  Nor will we be taking questions about the secret children no one was allowed to know [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=113.38s)]
*  about while he's running on his supposed family values. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=116.74s)]
*  Nor will we be taking any questions about any of the abortions even though he wants [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=120.05999999999999s)]
*  all abortions banned. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=123.66s)]
*  Nope, we will not be taking questions about the times he said he used to run six hospitals [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=125.06s)]
*  and that he graduated from college in the top 1% of his class when he actually did not [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=131.54s)]
*  graduate from college at all. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=135.54s)]
*  Nor will we be taking questions about his fantasies that he runs the country's largest [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=137.26s)]
*  upholstery business and also gigantic chicken businesses, which in fact he does not run. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=142.22s)]
*  Nor will we be taking questions about the times he said he was a law enforcement officer [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=148.62s)]
*  or the time he claimed to be an FBI agent. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=152.54s)]
*  No, he is not an FBI agent. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=155.62s)]
*  He is not a police officer even though he has said he was both. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=157.62s)]
*  We will not be answering questions about those matters today, but do please vote for the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=160.54s)]
*  man anyway. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=163.85999999999999s)]
*  As Republican Party values, I'm here to attest. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=165.74s)]
*  Your job may suck. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=171.9s)]
*  I hope it doesn't. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=173.02s)]
*  I hope you have a great job. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=174.02s)]
*  But even if your job sucks, you're still not Rick Scott. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=175.18s)]
*  Imagine that was your job. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=179.02s)]
*  Republican Senator Rick Scott is running the Senate campaigns this year for the Republicans. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=182.66000000000003s)]
*  Tomorrow he really is going to have to go do that in Georgia to try to save that Georgia [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=186.82000000000002s)]
*  Senate race for the Republican Party where their candidate, unfortunately for them, is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=191.02s)]
*  Marshall Walker. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=195.42s)]
*  And then there's, you know, the Republican candidate for Senate in Arizona who says his [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=197.1s)]
*  vote for the most underrated thinker is the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=201.17999999999998s)]
*  And this is not a circumstance in which the candidate was given a test where it was multiple [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=207.7s)]
*  choice. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=211.98s)]
*  The only possible answers were like, you know, Satan, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, Stalin or the Unabomber. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=212.98s)]
*  It's not like he had to choose the best among bad. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  It was just an open question. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=222.77999999999997s)]
*  Who do you like? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=224.01999999999998s)]
*  And he just volunteered that the one he likes is the Unabomber. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=225.62s)]
*  Subversive thinker that's underrated? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=230.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=232.62s)]
*  I'll probably get in trouble for saying this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=233.62s)]
*  I'd say, how about like Theodore Kaczynski? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=238.62s)]
*  Good. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=242.62s)]
*  Good one. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=243.62s)]
*  Actually, yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=244.62s)]
*  Probably not great to be talking about the Unabomber while campaigning. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=248.02s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=252.62s)]
*  That wasn't like a youthful indiscretion. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  That was this year while he's running. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=256.3s)]
*  And now he's the Republican nominee for Senate in the great state of Arizona, everyone. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=259.26s)]
*  If you didn't like that the Unabomber wasn't able to get more of what he wanted, just elect [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  Blake Masters and see. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=268.54s)]
*  I mean, so it's tempting when you've got, you know, Herschel Walker in Georgia, when [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=271.46s)]
*  you've got that guy in Arizona, when you've got this snake oil quack supplement salesman, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=277.34s)]
*  green coffee beans as your Republican candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  It is tempting to look at that sort of slate for this year and think something's gone wrong [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=288.22s)]
*  in a uniquely bad way this year. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=292.70000000000005s)]
*  It's never been this bad. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=294.54s)]
*  No political party has ever had to face candidate problems this bad. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=295.82000000000005s)]
*  But as bad as it is right now, it has been worse. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=300.58000000000004s)]
*  I swear. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  Today, Russia launched the largest airstrikes since the start of the war, saying they were [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=304.58000000000004s)]
*  retaliating for the attack this weekend on their newly built bridge to Crimea, Crimea, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=310.9s)]
*  of course, another part of Ukraine that Russia took over several years ago. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=316.9s)]
*  The attacks by Russia today were not carried out by Russian troops making ground advances. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=321.02s)]
*  The Ukrainian military has been pushing Russian forces back and retaking the parts of Ukraine [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=326.34s)]
*  that Russia had invaded with ground troops. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=331.38s)]
*  Now, what happened today all over Ukraine, including in the capital city, including in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=333.46s)]
*  western Ukraine, far from the front lines, what happened today were these long range [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=338.46s)]
*  Russian airstrikes on population centers, on cities, including the capital city, on [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=342.85999999999996s)]
*  civilian infrastructure. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=349.29999999999995s)]
*  And that poses a big question for us, for the United States. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  As of now, one of the items on Ukraine's wish list that we have not given them are [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=357.14s)]
*  systems so they could answer Russian long range airstrikes in kind. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=363.02s)]
*  Joining us now is John Kirby, retired rear admiral in the United States Navy, former [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=370.58s)]
*  Pentagon press secretary, now the spokesman for President Biden's National Security Council. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  Admiral Kirby, it's a real pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=377.7s)]
*  Thank you for making the time. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=379.9s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=380.9s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=381.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=384.18s)]
*  Let me just ask, first of all, if I got any of that the wrong way around or if there's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=385.18s)]
*  anything important that I'm leaving out just in summing that up briefly there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=388.38s)]
*  No, no, I thought that was a terrific way to introduce our conversation tonight, Rachel. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=392.21999999999997s)]
*  The conversation today with President Zelensky was useful, certainly helpful for President [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=399.06s)]
*  Biden, and it was really important for President Biden to convey to President Zelensky that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=404.86s)]
*  we are going to continue our support, as the president has said, for as long as it takes. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=409.98s)]
*  As you sort of did in your introduction, it includes continued air defense support. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=415.28s)]
*  We have provided 1,400 stingers. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=419.61999999999995s)]
*  These are short range shoulder fired air defense missiles. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  We have helped get through other countries some longer range air defense systems like [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  the S-300, which is something that the Ukrainians are comfortable using, gotten that into the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=431.2s)]
*  country. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=436.11999999999995s)]
*  Just recently, we've agreed to procure eight what we call NASAMs, which is a National Advanced [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=437.67999999999995s)]
*  Surface to Air Missile System, which will also greatly improve their ability for air [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=443.76s)]
*  defense purposes. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=448.59999999999997s)]
*  So we're going to stay committed to this. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  We're going to talk to them every day, just like we did today, and make sure that we're [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=451.84s)]
*  meeting their needs as best we can. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=455.0s)]
*  And what about offensive weapons? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=457.48s)]
*  I mean, being able to disrupt, intercept, shoot down Russian incoming is one thing, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=459.2s)]
*  but we know the Ukrainians want advanced rocket systems, advanced missile systems, and things [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=465.4s)]
*  with perhaps a longer range than we've been willing to give them before. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=471.34000000000003s)]
*  I know that you're not going to break news here in terms of what the United States is [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=474.74s)]
*  willing to give Ukraine that we haven't previously given them. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=477.7s)]
*  But what can you explain to us about the thought process and the kind of parameters in which [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=480.98s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=485.38s)]
*  Government feels like it has to be able to operate to both help but not go too far to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=486.38s)]
*  potentially provoke a Russia-NATO conflict? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=490.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, these are iterative conversations, honestly, that we're having with them almost [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=493.54s)]
*  every day. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=499.74s)]
*  You know, if you remember way back in February, now almost eight months ago when this war [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=501.18s)]
*  started, the real demand signal was for Javelin anti-tank missiles because it was those big [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=504.38s)]
*  convoys moving on Kiev, and they needed to get those armored vehicles stopped. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=509.02s)]
*  Then it was about stingers, right, in more short-range air defense. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=514.86s)]
*  As Putin decided in the spring that he was going to focus on the Donbass, which is a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=519.34s)]
*  lot like Kansas, it's open farmland, small villages and towns, we knew, and the Ukrainians [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=523.02s)]
*  knew, that they were going to need artillery. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=528.58s)]
*  So we had what we call long-range fires, the ability to hit targets far away on the ground, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=531.4200000000001s)]
*  from the ground, and so we provided dozens and dozens of howitzers, artillery pieces, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=535.22s)]
*  as well as literally tens of thousands of pieces of ammunition for them, as well as [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=540.3000000000001s)]
*  these highmars that I know you've been talking about, the advanced rocket systems that are [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=544.1s)]
*  highly mobile highmars, that's what that means. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=550.58s)]
*  They've got almost 20 of those on the ground. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=553.7800000000001s)]
*  So we're going to keep evolving the needs as the war changes, and you are starting to [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=556.9s)]
*  see, as President Zelensky said today, clearly a stronger need right now for air defense. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=561.34s)]
*  And so we're going to have that conversation with them, we're going to keep changing the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=567.34s)]
*  capabilities that we provide to make sure we're meeting their needs. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=571.1s)]
*  Look, they are in the fight of their lives, literally, and some of that video footage [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=574.66s)]
*  that you showed, I think, demonstrates the degree to which Mr. Putin was going after [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=579.0600000000001s)]
*  civilian infrastructure and civilian targets with no regard for innocent civilian life. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=583.34s)]
*  We know that the fight is serious there, and we're going to keep making sure that, again, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=589.22s)]
*  the capabilities we give them are helping them in that fight, helping them defend their [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=594.02s)]
*  territory. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=597.4200000000001s)]
*  There's been a bunch of reporting recently. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=598.4200000000001s)]
*  I feel like our capacity as criminologists have sort of waxed and waned over the course [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  of my lifetime in terms of how much we understand about what's really happening in St. Peter's [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=606.2s)]
*  Square over there. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=610.58s)]
*  But I feel like there's been a lot of reporting recently that war hawks, real hardliners within [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=611.58s)]
*  the Russian power structure, have been exerting a lot of pressure on Putin to escalate attacks [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=618.74s)]
*  on Ukraine. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=624.46s)]
*  That may be some of what he is responding to. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=625.46s)]
*  You saw an interesting sort of reflection of that, I thought, today, when the Ukrainians [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=627.14s)]
*  said that we don't believe today's missile strikes by Russia were in response to the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=632.3000000000001s)]
*  bridge attack this weekend. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=637.56s)]
*  We think that these were planned even before the bridge was hit, which would imply that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=638.76s)]
*  Putin was responding to other kinds of pressures rather than just retaliating for that one [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=643.2399999999999s)]
*  attack. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=648.4399999999999s)]
*  How much do you credit those reports? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=649.5999999999999s)]
*  How important is it for us to understand what's motivating Putin in any one day? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=651.28s)]
*  It's always important to understand the decision-making process over there because of the toll it's [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=658.92s)]
*  literally taking on the people of Ukraine. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=663.56s)]
*  And I wish I could tell you, Rachel, that we have perfect visibility into how Mr. Putin [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=666.08s)]
*  thinks or what his next move is going to be. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=670.0s)]
*  We just don't. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=672.32s)]
*  What we can do is judge by his actions in the past and see kind of how things are unfolding [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=673.88s)]
*  on the battlefield, which again informs the capabilities that we provide the Ukrainians. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=678.6800000000001s)]
*  I think there's a case to be made here that these attacks today were probably planned [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=682.9200000000001s)]
*  quite a while ago. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=689.2s)]
*  You think about the size and scale and scope of these attacks. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=691.32s)]
*  I think there's more than 80 missiles and or drones used in today's attacks. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=694.4s)]
*  The Russians can't throw something like that together in just a couple of days. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=698.36s)]
*  So I think there's some credibility to the idea that this itself wasn't just a retaliation [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=701.72s)]
*  to the explosion on the Crimea bridge. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=707.48s)]
*  Now, maybe they accelerated it a little bit because I don't know. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=709.32s)]
*  But this is very much what we've seen today is very much in keeping with the attacks on [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=713.2s)]
*  civilian infrastructure that we have been seeing over the last month, the six weeks. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=717.32s)]
*  We see it very much as a continuation of the brutality and again, the wanton disregard [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=721.9200000000001s)]
*  by Mr. Putin for innocent civilian life inside Ukraine. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=726.4000000000001s)]
*  It's very much in keeping with that track. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  Now, where it goes from here, again, we don't know. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=731.8800000000001s)]
*  Nobody wants to see this war escalate beyond the level of death and destruction that it's [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=734.32s)]
*  already visited on the Ukrainian people. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  We have been, and I think you and I have talked about this in the past, from the very beginning, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=741.5600000000001s)]
*  we've been mindful of escalation management here as we've gone through the provision of [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=746.2s)]
*  supplies and security assistance to Ukraine, making sure that we are thinking through escalation [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=750.74s)]
*  management issues as we do that. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=756.02s)]
*  Because again, having this war escalate beyond where it is, having it see the use of weapons [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=758.66s)]
*  of mass destruction would not only be horrible for the Ukrainian people, but would have effects [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=766.02s)]
*  well beyond just Ukraine on the European continent and quite frankly around the world. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=771.64s)]
*  John Kirby, retired real Admiral in the United States Navy, now spokesperson for President [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=778.0200000000001s)]
*  Biden's National Security Council. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=782.0600000000001s)]
*  Sir, it's always an honor to have some time with you whenever you can afford it to us. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=783.46s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=787.74s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=789.22s)]
*  Always good to be with you. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=790.22s)]
*  The story of this forgotten Senator, William Langer, and the accused seditionists he so [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=793.62s)]
*  loudly supported in Washington, that is part of my new podcast that just launched today. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=801.1400000000001s)]
*  It's the story of members of Congress who are implicated in just some terrible stuff, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=807.92s)]
*  senators and members of the House both. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=813.36s)]
*  And when the Justice Department tried to act in the courts, when the Justice Department [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=815.36s)]
*  pursued an investigation and brought a criminal prosecution of people who were involved in [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=819.16s)]
*  plots to violently overthrow the government, these members of Congress sprung into action [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=823.42s)]
*  to save themselves and derail the investigation into these threats to throw out the results [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=829.68s)]
*  of a presidential election, to violently overthrow the U.S. government, to have an authoritarian [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=835.1800000000001s)]
*  government here instead of a democracy. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=839.38s)]
*  It all happened. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=843.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, January 6th, 2021 was really something. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=844.4200000000001s)]
*  And the members of Congress who were tied up in it and the sedition trials that have [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=849.4200000000001s)]
*  just started this month for these pro-Trump paramilitary groups who were part of it, it's [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=853.58s)]
*  an amazing thing that we are going through as a country right now. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=857.86s)]
*  But this is not the first time we have been through something along these lines. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=860.7s)]
*  And I can tell you, spending all these months working on this project, working on this story, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=866.94s)]
*  I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you that one of the main takeaways for us, at [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=871.38s)]
*  least one of the main takeaways for me, looking at what happened last time that we were up [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=877.3000000000001s)]
*  against something like this, is that the criminal law can't do everything. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=881.0200000000001s)]
*  I mean, we can't ever count on it all being settled in the courtroom. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=887.14s)]
*  When the country is up against rising authoritarianism and election denialism and extremist ultra-right [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=892.78s)]
*  groups that are willing to use violence against everyone else to get their way, those are [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=898.9s)]
*  crimes and there definitely is a role for the courts and for the prison system, right? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=903.08s)]
*  But there's also a really important role for everything else, for a whole-of-society response. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=908.34s)]
*  I mean, the criminal justice system isn't bulletproof, but it also doesn't address [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=914.42s)]
*  the nature of those crimes in their totality. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=919.0999999999999s)]
*  And so in order to effectively combat fascism, in order to effectively combat rising authoritarianism, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=923.2199999999999s)]
*  particularly when it comes to trying to undo elections and trying to have power be both [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=930.18s)]
*  achieved and maintained in this country by some means other than democracy, when it comes [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=936.54s)]
*  to threatening force as the way of seizing power here, there is not only room, there [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=940.74s)]
*  is a necessity for a whole-of-society response, for everybody to do something, for activism, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=946.42s)]
*  for journalism, for political organizing to keep those folks away from real power. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=953.12s)]
*  Anyway, like I said, I see a way in which you learn that we've been through something [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=959.42s)]
*  like this before, and that can be enervating, that can be draining. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=967.3s)]
*  God, like, are we ever going to get away from this? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=970.42s)]
*  On the other hand, knowing that we faced it before, and we've effectively faced it before, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=972.5s)]
*  and there have been Americans before us who had great ideas about how to outflank and [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=977.06s)]
*  defeat those forces, that to me is energizing and interesting. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=980.54s)]
*  And it's a story I've been desperate to tell for months now. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=986.3599999999999s)]
*  I have been working on this for months, and it's out today. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=988.9s)]
*  It's free. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=991.8199999999999s)]
*  You can get it anywhere you get your podcasts. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=992.8199999999999s)]
*  The title is Rachel Maddow Presents Ultra. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=994.3s)]
*  I know it feels like there's nothing we can agree on as Americans in these polarized times. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=997.8199999999999s)]
*  Maybe puppies? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1006.38s)]
*  Ice cream? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1007.38s)]
*  Obviously, Dolly Parton, yes. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1008.38s)]
*  But politically, is there anything the vast, vast majority of us agree on? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1010.9399999999999s)]
*  There's this. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1016.66s)]
*  By overwhelming margins, Americans support legislation to lower the price of prescription [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1017.78s)]
*  drugs. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1022.5799999999999s)]
*  Huge margin Americans are in favor of allowing Medicare, which is the health insurance program [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1024.26s)]
*  for seniors, allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies to make drugs cheaper. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1028.58s)]
*  Poll after poll. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1033.7s)]
*  Americans who support that, it's like 70 to 80 plus percent. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1035.02s)]
*  It is puppies and ice cream level support. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1038.06s)]
*  Well, lo and behold, representative democracy has broken out. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1040.42s)]
*  Democrats included a provision along those lines when they passed the big Inflation Reduction [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1045.42s)]
*  Act this past summer. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1050.56s)]
*  Others said it was their favorite part of the bill. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1052.78s)]
*  Democrats kept the provision in there. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1055.18s)]
*  They passed the bill. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1056.3s)]
*  They accomplished this goal they'd been pursuing for a generation when President Biden signed [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1057.3s)]
*  it into law in August, something Americans have wanted by huge margins for decades. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1060.54s)]
*  Medicare negotiating for lower drug prices. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1066.58s)]
*  It becomes the very, very popular law of the land. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1068.84s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1072.98s)]
*  Plus, same bill put a cap on how much seniors have to pay for drugs overall, including insulin. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1073.98s)]
*  Also hugely popular, and the Democrats got it done. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1082.16s)]
*  They got it passed. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1084.88s)]
*  And that is how things stand right now in the law. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1086.72s)]
*  Under the legislation President Biden signed, America's seniors will be paying less for [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1089.3200000000002s)]
*  their prescription drugs. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1093.68s)]
*  No one will ever have to pay more than $2,000 a year. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1095.28s)]
*  The price of drugs in general will get negotiated down. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1098.0400000000002s)]
*  For everyone, it's done. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1100.52s)]
*  It's in the law. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1101.9s)]
*  And now, one month out from the elections, Republicans have unveiled their own new plan, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1103.6200000000001s)]
*  their own new bill on this issue, a bill that would do just one thing. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1109.56s)]
*  It would undo all that stuff on drug prices. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1114.58s)]
*  No more price caps on prescription drugs. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1117.9199999999998s)]
*  No more negotiating for lower prices. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1120.22s)]
*  Get rid of all that. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1122.08s)]
*  It is literally a bill to make prescription drugs more expensive for senior citizens. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1123.08s)]
*  That's the only thing it will do. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1130.06s)]
*  Perhaps most astoundingly, one of the co-sponsors of this new Republican higher drug prices [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  for old people bill is Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who happens to be [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1137.92s)]
*  in the midst of a competitive race against a formidable challenger, Democratic Congresswoman, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1143.04s)]
*  the former Orlando police chief Val Demings is running against him. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1147.8400000000001s)]
*  And did I mention this is a Senate race in Florida? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1152.2s)]
*  You may have heard Florida has a sizable population of the olds who vote. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1154.64s)]
*  Florida has the second highest number of Medicare recipients of any state in the country. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1160.44s)]
*  So you're running for Senate in Florida and you're going to sponsor legislation to raise [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1165.56s)]
*  drug prices for all senior citizens right now, a month out from the election. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1170.6s)]
*  That is an amazing closing argument. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1176.86s)]
*  I mean between Biden pardoning everybody for pot possession, unemployment below 4%, Republicans [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1178.52s)]
*  literally pursuing a national abortion ban and a bill designed to raise the cost of prescriptions [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1186.3799999999999s)]
*  for old people. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1192.48s)]
*  How are we doing this right now? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1194.56s)]
*  How is this the closing argument? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1195.76s)]
*  But it is. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5_q8KyW5l0&t=1199.12s)]
