Video Description: While normal banks have shied away from dealing with Donald Trump, one bank has repeatedly bailed him out of tough financial situations, including paying the bond while he appeals his civil fraud trial loss. Rachel Maddow takes a closer look at the bank and the billionaire associated with it to understand why it may not be the lifeline Trump needs.

# Bank with a checkered past and a deep history with Trump raises red flags
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g)
*  The story of this super high interest car loan company threatening its customers and getting in trouble all over the place for doing it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=0.0s)]
*  That story has crossed over now from the businesses and from the news of fraud and crime into national politics news. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=9.0s)]
*  Because this is the source of funds now that is supporting the man who has a very good shot of being the next president of the United States. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=20.0s)]
*  This is now the major source of funds for former president Donald Trump as he prepares to sit as a defendant in his first felony criminal trial, which starts one week from today, while he simultaneously is running for president as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=28.0s)]
*  The bank in question here, it really did used to be called Bank of Internet USA. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=43.0s)]
*  It has now changed its name to Axos Bank. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=49.0s)]
*  Bank. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=53.0s)]
*  When Donald Trump left office in 2021, normal banks and businesses, at least for a while, purported to be shocked and horrified by him using mob violence to attack the U.S. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=55.0s)]
*  capital to try to stay in power by violence, despite losing the election. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=65.0s)]
*  That was that was a particularly acute financial problem for him right when he left office because in 2021 as he left office, he was facing looming deadlines to pay back huge loans on both his Trump Tower property in New York and his golf club in South Florida. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=71.0s)]
*  Those loans were coming due when normal banks wanted absolutely nothing to do with him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=88.0s)]
*  But not every bank, it turns out, is normal because this bank, Axos Bank. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=94.0s)]
*  Bailed him out of both of those huge loans. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=100.0s)]
*  They came out of nowhere, provided 225 million dollars to Trump just before the deadline by which he needed to pay off those loans. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=103.0s)]
*  They absolutely rescued him. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=110.0s)]
*  He also at the time wanted to get out of one of his big money losing ventures. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=114.0s)]
*  The Trump branded DC Hotel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=119.0s)]
*  While Trump was president, that hotel was, of course, a convenient place to accept effectively small bribes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=121.0s)]
*  Any place, you know, a customer wanted to put money and any customer who wanted to put money in the sitting president's pocket could in effect do so by spending money at that hotel, either on rooms or at the restaurants or what have you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=127.0s)]
*  And while I'm sure that was a great source of pleasure and flattery to the former president while he was president, even with that weird secondary motivation for people to do business there, the hotel overall was a big economic loser. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=141.0s)]
*  While Trump was president, that hotel lost 70 million dollars. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=156.0s)]
*  So he wanted to unload it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=162.0s)]
*  And then this weird thing happened because it's a money losing property. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=164.0s)]
*  But nevertheless, after he left left office, when he put it up for sale, he was able to get a surprisingly high price for it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=168.0s)]
*  Why was that? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=176.0s)]
*  Well, in part, it was because the same bank Axos Bank provided 190 million dollars to grease the deal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=177.0s)]
*  Now, is that is that a lot of money for them to put into it? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=187.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=189.0s)]
*  But Trump and his companies pocketed nearly half that amount when the deal was done. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=190.0s)]
*  So it seems like maybe that was plenty enough money to put into that deal to make it a sweet deal for him. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=194.0s)]
*  So this this one entity, this financial entity linked to this usurious Carlo's guy, they've already dumped over 400 million dollars on Trump since he left office, not counting the tens of millions of dollars they dumped on Jared while Jared was in the Trump White House and after. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=201.0s)]
*  And now it's these same folks who have come back and offered yet more. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=226.0s)]
*  In the fraud trial against Trump's real estate business, he was told by the court to put up a bond for four hundred and sixty four million dollars to cover the huge judgment against him in that fraud trial. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=229.0s)]
*  Trump's lawyers, you will remember, told the court they'd approached 30 different firms about providing that bond. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=240.0s)]
*  All the firms, they said, said no. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=246.0s)]
*  They said everybody they went to said no. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=248.0s)]
*  Because of that, they said they had proven in practical terms. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=251.0s)]
*  It's an impossibility to get a bond that big. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=256.0s)]
*  No one will do it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=258.0s)]
*  We've gone to 30 different firms. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=259.0s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=261.0s)]
*  We would have to put up real estate to be the collateral for a bond that big. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=262.0s)]
*  Nobody willing to consider a bond that big will accept real estate as a collateral. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=266.0s)]
*  Real estate as collateral. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=271.0s)]
*  It cannot be done. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=272.0s)]
*  Turns out maybe that wasn't true. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=274.0s)]
*  Turns out could have been done because this same guy, the Carlo's guy, the pretentious guy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=278.0s)]
*  The pretend you're the pizza place. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=285.0s)]
*  Super high interest. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=287.0s)]
*  Call your boss. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=288.0s)]
*  Call your mom. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=289.0s)]
*  Car loan guy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=290.0s)]
*  The biggest shareholder in the bank that has one after another, one after another, been paying off all of Trump's debts for him since he left office. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=291.0s)]
*  This same guy says, actually, he'd be happy to put up the bond. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=298.0s)]
*  He says that he told Trump's lawyers he would put up that bond. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=304.0s)]
*  And, yeah, explicitly, he'd take real estate as collateral. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=308.0s)]
*  That was no problem for him. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=311.0s)]
*  Trump's lawyers apparently never told the court that this guy had offered to post the bond. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=314.0s)]
*  In fact, they told the court that no one would post this bond. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=319.0s)]
*  The appeals court, apparently believing that no one would post the bond, then lowered the bond, lowered it down to $175 million, which was then covered by this guy who had already offered to put up the much larger amount. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=322.0s)]
*  Even though the court was told by Trump's lawyers that no one would do that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=341.0s)]
*  What did Trump have to do to be the recipient of such generosity from a man who, after all, is not that generous? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=346.0s)]
*  A man who, after all, would threaten illegally to lock you up for missing a car payment, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, whose bank charged a Harlem soul food restaurant 268% interest on their business loan. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=355.0s)]
*  A guy who demanded daily payments from a small business in Massachusetts that he was charging over 90% interest to, right? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=372.0s)]
*  This does not seem like a guy who's involved in a lot of super generous business dealings. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=380.0s)]
*  What's he charging Trump for this $175 million favor? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=385.0s)]
*  And certainly there is a disturbance in the cosmos to have a man whose company was sued by the Justice Department for charging illegally high interest rates to active duty members of the U.S. military and illegally repossessing soldiers' cars so he could become a billionaire. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=389.0s)]
*  There is a disturbance in the cosmos that that same guy is now volunteering to a news organization. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=408.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a real low fee. I charged him for this most recent $175 million favor I posted for him after I already shoveled him after me and these entities with which I am associated already shoveled him more than $400 million before this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=413.0s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't charge him much. Why should I? Maybe I should have charged him a little more. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=428.0s)]
*  There is something that blots out the sun in that story. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=431.0s)]
*  Except not in a way that makes you appreciate the wonders of the universe. It makes you want to pound nails into something with your forehead if you're like me. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=436.0s)]
*  Get or the cloud icon and enjoy it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0PH9sxl8g&t=466.0s)]
