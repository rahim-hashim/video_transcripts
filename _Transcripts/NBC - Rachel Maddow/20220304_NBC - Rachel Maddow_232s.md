# People In Southern Ukraine Prepare To Disrupt Putin's Assault Plans
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw)
*  The video journalist whose work you just saw there is Whitney Leeming from The Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=0.0s)]
*  Post. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=4.64s)]
*  She has been traveling south through Ukraine, from Kharkiv to Dnipro to Odessa, reporting [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=5.88s)]
*  on this war as it unfolds in real time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=11.32s)]
*  Tonight she joins us from the port city of Odessa in southwestern Ukraine, where people [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=14.84s)]
*  spent the day filling up sandbags and gathering supplies as they await what is being described [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=19.16s)]
*  as an imminent assault from Russian forces. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=24.0s)]
*  Ms. Leeming, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=26.6s)]
*  I know it is late your time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=28.68s)]
*  Thanks for staying up for us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=30.6s)]
*  Let's talk about your paper for a moment. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=32.56s)]
*  The Washington Post reported that the city is preparing, as you just said as well, amid [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=33.88s)]
*  unverified reports that a large fleet of Russian warships was heading towards the waters off [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=38.4s)]
*  of the coast. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=43.96s)]
*  Can you just expand a little bit more on what you were saying? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=45.08s)]
*  Have you heard anything about this from people you've been speaking to on the ground or perhaps [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  even officials that they are anticipating this? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=51.32s)]
*  What is that based on? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  There have been reports of ships off of the coast. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=57.44s)]
*  We haven't seen movement or heard of movement from official sources over the past two days. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=62.48s)]
*  So we're not sure what exactly is going on, but assaults like these are very difficult [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  and take time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=76.4s)]
*  That time has allowed the city to prepare. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=78.96s)]
*  We are being told that the beaches are completely mined. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=82.8s)]
*  You can see when you come into the city, hedgehogs made to slow down or stop tanks and other [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=87.28s)]
*  types of cars all around the city, kind of trying to hope to slow down any forces to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=94.16s)]
*  let the citizens prepare. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=101.0s)]
*  I understand that before you arrived in Odessa, you were in the eastern cities of Nipro and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=103.72s)]
*  Oman. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=108.12s)]
*  What were you seeing as you moved westward? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=109.12s)]
*  Can you just describe for us that journey? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=110.72s)]
*  Are there checkpoints on the highways? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=113.68s)]
*  Was there bombardment? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=115.84s)]
*  Do you see people trying to escape smaller towns and perhaps villages on your route? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=117.4s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  So we made the trip from Denimipro to Oman. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  One day it should have been about a six-hour car drive. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=128.84s)]
*  It took over 12 hours. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=132.52s)]
*  You're seeing extremely long lines of evacuees. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=135.0s)]
*  Many of these people have homemade signs posted throughout their car that say children on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=139.44s)]
*  them, trying to let officials know that there's kids in the car. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=145.8s)]
*  There's many checkpoints that you have to go through. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=151.64s)]
*  Some of these are controlled by the military and city and town police. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=154.64s)]
*  Others are controlled by volunteer militia who don't have a ton of training and who are [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=161.72s)]
*  justifiably very jumpy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=166.36s)]
*  So people are doing whatever they can to protect themselves. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=169.24s)]
*  Some of these checkpoints take hours and hours to get through. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=172.64s)]
*  We made it into Oman actually after curfew because of being stuck for hours in these [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=175.76s)]
*  long lines to get through the checkpoints. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=185.27999999999997s)]
*  You also, while you see huge caravans of families heading west, you'll see very few cars coming [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=187.6s)]
*  back east. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=195.44s)]
*  And almost all of those cars are filled with what it looks like to be single men. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  Our assumption, and from a few people that we've talked to, is that people are driving [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=202.0s)]
*  their families towards safety and then returning home to protect their own neighborhoods. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jah6mVlvYzw&t=206.32s)]
