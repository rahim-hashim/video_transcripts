Video Description: Rachel Maddow looks at how Donald Trump falls short of Kamala Harris in every basic campaign metric, from likability to organizing but still appears within striking distance of a win if he deploys the election subversion tactics he’s been preparing since his 2020 loss to Joe Biden.

# Maddow: Donald Trump fails campaign fundamentals but keeps wildcards up his sleeve
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE)
*  Sometimes the vote in a national election is about the fundamentals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, like, is this candidate a good choice on the economy? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=5.48s)]
*  Sometimes it's about a different kind of fundamental. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=9.16s)]
*  Does this candidate say he likes Hitler? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=11.4s)]
*  Sometimes it's a more personal thing when it comes to just liking each of these [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=15.8s)]
*  candidates or not liking each of these candidates. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=20.48s)]
*  Americans broadly like Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=23.04s)]
*  And they broadly do not like Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=27.56s)]
*  Vance. The latest AP poll on just this sheer question, do you like him or don't [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=30.8s)]
*  you? It puts Kamala Harris plus five favorable, Tim Walz plus five favorable. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=35.24s)]
*  It puts J.D. Vance minus 16 unfavorable and Donald Trump minus 17 unfavorable. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=40.64s)]
*  That's its own kind of election fundamental as well. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=50.44s)]
*  You know, and maybe this election will come down to the fundamentals, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=52.88s)]
*  Number one, economic basics. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=56.84s)]
*  Harris and the Biden, the Harris and Biden administration with a rip roaring economic [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=59.32s)]
*  record to run on literally the envy of the world. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=64.28s)]
*  Maybe they'll be on number two, likeability of the candidate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=68.0s)]
*  Voters like Harris roughly 22 points more than they like Donald Trump, who they really [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=71.4s)]
*  don't like at all. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=76.64s)]
*  They just flat out like her and don't like him. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  She's positive, he's negative. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=80.84s)]
*  She's positive by a little. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=82.36s)]
*  He's negative by a lot. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=83.48s)]
*  Another fundamental number three, quality of the campaign. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=87.56s)]
*  I mean, just take a little snapshot of the quality of the campaign right now at crunch [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  time one week out here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday was the local press coverage of Kamala Harris's day in Swing State, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=99.64s)]
*  Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Inquirer. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=103.68s)]
*  Kamala Harris goes to church visiting the church. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=106.84s)]
*  Harris goes to church, visits small businesses and yet another visit to Philadelphia. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=109.4s)]
*  Simultaneously, here was the local press coverage of Donald Trump's day in not a swing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=114.44000000000001s)]
*  state, New York, New York Daily News, racist rally, speaker supporting Trump at his [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=119.04s)]
*  Madison Square Garden event, insult Puerto Ricans, blacks and Jews. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=124.64s)]
*  And you know, and when it comes to the quality of the campaign, not for nothing, but Trump [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=132.32s)]
*  has also been focusing his campaign message in these final few days to include really [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=137.0s)]
*  important issues like him saying that he thinks there's life on Mars. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=141.16s)]
*  His top surrogate and funder, Elon Musk, telling a Trump rally crowd that there are [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=145.96s)]
*  aliens walking among us right now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=150.12s)]
*  Trump has also really ramped up all of his talk about Robert F. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=153.12s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. here at the end of the campaign. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=156.16s)]
*  He says that R.F.K. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=158.56s)]
*  Jr. is going to get a big job in government. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=159.88s)]
*  In Trump's terms, he's going to be in charge of making America healthy again. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=162.68s)]
*  If Trump is reelected, Robert F. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=167.48s)]
*  Kennedy Jr. is going to get a big job. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=169.32s)]
*  He's saying this more and more now on the campaign trail. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=171.6s)]
*  He thinks this is awesome. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=173.72s)]
*  While R.F.K. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=175.04s)]
*  Jr. himself is spending his end of the campaign talking about how we can't have Wi-Fi [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=176.04s)]
*  anymore in America because Wi-Fi causes something that he calls leaky brain. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=180.92s)]
*  If you have Wi-Fi, you get leaky brain. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=188.28s)]
*  Also, HIV doesn't cause AIDS. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=192.52s)]
*  The early 90s called and they'd like their conspiracy theory back. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=195.52s)]
*  So, you know, maybe it's the economy, maybe it's the candidates, maybe it's the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  campaigns. I don't know how this election is going to be decided. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  Neither do you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=207.84s)]
*  But there are there are two additional wild cards that we need to factor in to how this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  election is going to resolve. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=214.12s)]
*  And we shouldn't have to factor either of these in. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  But we do. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  The first is the absolutely true. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=220.52s)]
*  The absolutely totally telegraphed, easily foretold effort. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=224.2s)]
*  By the Republican Party to disrupt, subvert, ultimately to try to steal the election if [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=229.84s)]
*  they lose it, to try to flip the results or to cause enough chaos and delay and confusion [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=236.64s)]
*  that they prevent any clear election result from emerging. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=241.64s)]
*  And as you know, we have covered this in detail now for most of the past four years [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=245.76s)]
*  since their last effort to overthrow an election result caused chaos and intimidation and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=251.4s)]
*  violence and death and ultimately led to hundreds of people being convicted of crimes and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  sent to prison. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  They have they have professionalized their approach to the matter since then. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=262.0s)]
*  And I were there's there's only a certain percentage right in covering this stuff ad [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=266.12s)]
*  nauseam. We know to expect it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=272.0s)]
*  We are ready to watch for it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=273.88s)]
*  At this point, there's there's no doubt that it is coming. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  There's not much to do to prepare for it except to know that it's coming. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=281.6s)]
*  Sort of get your knees loose. Get ready. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=284.32s)]
*  We're watching for local Republican officials to refuse to certify election results even [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=286.32s)]
*  when elections are run totally normally. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  We're looking for them to at least try to delay certification of local election results [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=294.2s)]
*  in order to make it seem like there's something wrong with the election in their area. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=298.72s)]
*  So that can serve as a pretext for some sort of larger effort to gum up the works in that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=302.48s)]
*  state. We're watching for Republican state legislatures, especially in swing states. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=307.0s)]
*  Like Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Wisconsin, where Republicans have control of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=311.76s)]
*  the legislature. We're watching for those state legislatures to try to submit electoral [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=315.44s)]
*  votes for Trump, even if Harris wins those states. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=320.24s)]
*  Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson started saying this weekend that they have a secret [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=324.56s)]
*  plan between them, between Trump and the Republican controlled House that's going to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=328.72s)]
*  result in them doing, quote, really well in Trump's terms. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=333.2s)]
*  Presumably, that's something to do with how the Republican controlled Congress is planning [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=337.8s)]
*  to handle the counting of the electoral votes if Harris wins. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=342.36s)]
*  That, of course, is dependent on Republicans keeping control of the House. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=347.92s)]
*  So Mike Johnson will still be in charge, but apparently they have a plan in case he is. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=350.92s)]
*  Republican state legislators recently refused to comment to Politico.com when they were [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=356.56s)]
*  contacted last week and asked if they have been in touch with the Trump campaign about [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  trying some kind of fake electors plot again. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=366.24s)]
*  CNN reported late last week that the House Administration Committee in Congress has just [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=370.16s)]
*  hired two people who were involved in Trump's 2020 fake electors plot. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=374.36s)]
*  They've hired them to come on board as staff at that congressional committee right now to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  advise them on election matters. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=384.36s)]
*  House Administration Committee is the committee that actually reads the electoral votes and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=386.88s)]
*  advises members of Congress as to what procedures they should be following while doing [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=391.64s)]
*  things like reading and counting the electoral votes. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  Again, they've hired two people from Trump's fake electors scheme in 2020 to advise them as [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=401.0s)]
*  congressional staff for that process this year. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=406.24s)]
*  So, yeah, that that does not seem good. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=409.44s)]
*  And we shouldn't have to worry about and watch for things like that in an election. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  But in the Republican Party's Trump era, we absolutely do. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=416.32s)]
*  We should also expect that sometimes the goal will just be chaos. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=422.36s)]
*  So nobody has trust in the result. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=426.88s)]
*  You know, chaos and upset. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=428.68s)]
*  That anger and dread you felt when you saw the headlines today and you saw these images [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=431.15999999999997s)]
*  today of burning ballots. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=435.8s)]
*  The ballot drop boxes that were set on fire in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  In Vancouver, Washington, hundreds of ballots were destroyed. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=444.32s)]
*  In Portland, Oregon, interestingly, they think only three ballots were destroyed, and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=448.04s)]
*  that's because they'd installed a fire suppressant system inside that Portland. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=451.92s)]
*  Ballot drop box. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=458.2s)]
*  And thank God they had again, only three ballots considered to be damaged in the Portland [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=459.64s)]
*  fire bombing of a ballot drop box. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=465.36s)]
*  They've been able, they say, to contact the three voters whose ballots were damaged in [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=468.16s)]
*  Portland in Vancouver, where they believe it was hundreds of ballots destroyed. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  They're advising that people who put their ballots in that particular box that burned, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  people who put their ballots in sometime after 11 a.m. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  on Saturday, that was the last time it was empty before the fire. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=485.64s)]
*  People who may have used that ballot box in Vancouver, Washington, are being asked to [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=489.23999999999995s)]
*  contact the local elections department to get replacement ballots. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  Portland police say they think the two fires are connected. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CrQfAlieE&t=496.32s)]
