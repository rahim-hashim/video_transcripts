Video Description: Rachel Maddow reports on how the people of Lithuania, including its president, honored fallen U.S. soldiers who died while on a training mission there. In contrast, Donald Trump does not appear to have paid very close attention when the soldiers were initially missing, and is skipping the dignified transfer of the soldiers' bodies so he can attend golfing events in Florida instead.

# Donald Trump blows off dignified transfer of fallen U.S. soldiers for golf events
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U)
*  So they are soldiers from Lithuania. There's some others from Germany as well, but look what they have tucked into their pockets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=0.0s)]
*  They have little American flags just below the flag of their own countries sewn onto their sleeves. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=7.0s)]
*  In the capital city of Lithuania yesterday, thousands of soldiers and dignitaries and also just ordinary people lined up in the streets to pay their respects [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=14.0s)]
*  and to honor four American soldiers who died in Lithuania this past week during a training exercise. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=24.0s)]
*  The ceremony was attended by the president of Lithuania who gave a speech on the occasion. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=32.0s)]
*  He said that for Lithuanians, serving your country is not just a duty but an emotion. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=37.0s)]
*  And you could really see that among the people who gathered, Lithuanian citizens were moved to tears, moved to genuine grief. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=42.0s)]
*  But again, this was a ceremony for Americans, for American soldiers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=51.0s)]
*  Officials arranged for an archbishop to bless the motorcade before it drove to the airport to start the process of returning those remains, returning those soldiers to the U.S. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=55.0s)]
*  In our country, of course, it is a sacred tradition that when members of the armed services die in the line of duty overseas, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=66.0s)]
*  their remains come home to the U.S. in what's called a dignified transfer. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=75.0s)]
*  Their remains are flown home specifically to Dover Air Base with American flags draped over the coffins. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=79.0s)]
*  It's a very somber, very important, very serious, very specific ceremony. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=86.0s)]
*  And a dignified transfer is often attended by the president of the United States as a sign of respect from the commander-in-chief. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=91.0s)]
*  After that very moving sendoff from Lithuania and from the government and the people of Lithuania, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=99.0s)]
*  the White House announced here in the United States that when those four young fallen American soldiers landed back home here in the U.S., [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=107.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump would not attend the dignified transfer. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=119.0s)]
*  He would not be waiting at Dover to pay respects to the service members who died, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=122.0s)]
*  even as Lithuania's president made sure he was there to see them off. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=126.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has decided instead that he's going to Florida to watch a golf tournament and to go to a golf dinner tonight. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=131.0s)]
*  Given his previous comments, I guess you could say this is consistent with his apparent level of investment on this issue. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=140.0s)]
*  I've got to tell you, we do not play a lot of tape of Donald Trump talking on this show. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=152.0s)]
*  That's not a hard and fast rule, but kind of a rule of thumb on this show is that we try to cover what the president does rather than just what he says. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=157.0s)]
*  He gets plenty of coverage for what he says. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=165.0s)]
*  I prefer to focus on actions rather than his words. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=167.0s)]
*  In this case, though, I'm going to make a little bit of an exception. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=170.0s)]
*  I think what he said here is its own kind of action. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=173.0s)]
*  I just want you to see it. It's very brief. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=176.0s)]
*  This is how Donald Trump, president of the United States, responded when he was asked about the service members in Lithuania after they were first went missing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=178.0s)]
*  What was it again that the Lithuanian president said about service? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=204.0s)]
*  He said, for us, it is more than a duty. It is an emotion. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=207.0s)]
*  For Donald Trump, it was, huh? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=212.0s)]
*  No, haven't heard anything about it. Next question. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=215.0s)]
*  I'm going to go back to the question. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=237.0s)]
*  I'm going to go back to the question. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=239.0s)]
*  I'm going to go back to the question. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BofHyJWGf-U&t=241.0s)]
