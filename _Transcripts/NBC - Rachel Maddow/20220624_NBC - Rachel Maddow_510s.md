# Republican 40-Year Political Project Achieves Goal With Supreme Court Ending Roe v. Wade
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc)
*  When the Supreme Court first handed down the decision in Roe, just shy of 50 years ago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=0.0s)]
*  it's not like it was not controversial when it happened. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=5.0s)]
*  There were definitely people who were opposed to the Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973, in particular [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=8.92s)]
*  the Catholic Church, which had always been staunchly anti-abortion. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  But it wasn't as controversial in 1973 as today's politics about it might make you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=18.92s)]
*  think. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=24.0s)]
*  It was not a particularly controversial decision among American evangelicals. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=26.0s)]
*  The Southern Baptist Convention, America's largest Protestant denomination, they adopted [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=33.0s)]
*  pro-abortion rights resolutions regularly during the 1970s, including after the Roe [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=37.4s)]
*  decision in 1973, the Southern Baptists. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  When Roe was handed down in 1973, the former president of the Southern Baptist Convention [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=46.08s)]
*  welcomed it and explained why. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  He said, quote, I've always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=52.64s)]
*  life separate from its mother that it became an individual person. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  And it has always therefore seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=60.72s)]
*  should be allowed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=64.88s)]
*  Southern Baptist Convention. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=67.68s)]
*  Reactions to Roe vs. Wade were also really heterogeneous for a long time between the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=70.32s)]
*  two political parties. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=75.76s)]
*  There were plenty of anti-abortion Democrats and there were lots of pro-choice Republicans. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=76.76s)]
*  Republican governors were at the forefront of decriminalizing abortion in the states [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=83.48s)]
*  in the 1960s, including the governor of California, a man named Ronald Reagan. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=87.28s)]
*  In 1967, Ronald Reagan signed into law the most liberal abortion rights bill in the country [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  in California. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=98.16s)]
*  So it's not that there was not disagreement over abortion or that there weren't strong [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=100.48s)]
*  feelings from various quarters about Roe vs. Wade, but it was different. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=105.4s)]
*  And it specifically wasn't really a politics issue. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=109.98s)]
*  It wasn't an issue that swayed elections or that was a key part of the two parties' [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  political platforms. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=116.84s)]
*  And contrary to popular belief, Roe vs. Wade in 1973 did not spark some kind of immediate [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=117.84s)]
*  big backlash among conservatives and evangelicals and Republicans. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=124.12s)]
*  It evolved differently. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=129.2s)]
*  And it's important to know that today. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=130.48s)]
*  The anti-abortion movement as an explicitly political project, a movement married to the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  Republican Party, that had to be deliberately created. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=137.0s)]
*  It did not organically emerge. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=140.86s)]
*  And it actually did not happen until years after Roe was decided. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the influential right-wing pro-segregation religious leader, Jerry Falwell, his first [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=147.78s)]
*  anti-abortion sermon was not until 1978, more than five years after Roe. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=153.9s)]
*  Even as late as 1980, when Ronald Reagan by then was no longer governor of California, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  he was running for president. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=163.9s)]
*  In August 1980, Reagan gave a speech to 10,000 cheering evangelicals in a Dallas arena. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=165.62s)]
*  And he talked about creationism and the Bible. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=171.12s)]
*  He talked about how evangelical institutions ought to be able to remain racially segregated [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=173.44s)]
*  if they wanted. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=179.1s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=180.1s)]
*  But even then, he did not mention abortion. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=181.1s)]
*  The plan to use abortion as a right-wing political organizing tool, to try, for example, to move [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=184.24s)]
*  to the Republican Party, to give a focal point, a policy focus, to right-wing Republican organizing [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=191.86s)]
*  against women's rights. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=198.18s)]
*  It was a choice for them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=201.62s)]
*  It was a project that did not emerge organically. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=203.54000000000002s)]
*  It was something they didn't really start working on in earnest until the 1980s. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=206.02s)]
*  Ronald Reagan, for example, he personally had to do a U-turn. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=209.94000000000003s)]
*  He had to repudiate the abortion rights bill that he had signed as a California governor [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=214.18s)]
*  when he became the first president to make opposition to abortion a central part of his [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=219.46s)]
*  political identity. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=223.62s)]
*  His personal transformation on this issue shows the political transformation that was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  happening in the Republican Party on this issue, too. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=229.3s)]
*  Pretty soon, opposition to abortion would become effectively an entry requirement for [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=233.14000000000001s)]
*  elected officials in the Republican Party. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  And then pretty soon after that, anywhere Republicans had political power, they would [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  use it to attack abortion rights. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=242.66000000000003s)]
*  The states became laboratories for these policies. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  It became almost mechanized over time that as soon as one Republican-controlled state [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=247.46s)]
*  would innovate and come up with some new way to restrict abortion rights, all the other [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=251.74s)]
*  Republican-controlled states would then follow. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=255.3s)]
*  The most restrictive laws allowed to stand by the federal courts would then become the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=257.86s)]
*  template for all the other Republican-controlled states to try to enact those most restrictive [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=262.02s)]
*  rules, too. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=266.38s)]
*  Wanting to ban abortion became not just the litmus test. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  Question for Republican would be elected officials. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=271.26s)]
*  it was the litmus test for judges to be nominated by Republican presidents. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=274.58s)]
*  And at first that was kind of tacit, like everybody knew it, but nobody would admit [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=280.42s)]
*  to it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=283.66s)]
*  You know, a wink and a nod between Republican White Houses and conservative activists. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=284.66s)]
*  By 2016, though, Republican President Donald Trump just made it official. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=288.66s)]
*  He was known, obviously, for saying the quiet part out loud. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=293.22s)]
*  By 2016, he was flat out saying, and I will only nominate justices who will overturn Roe. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=296.62s)]
*  And he did. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=303.98s)]
*  And so today we have the results of not just these justices ascending to the court. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=304.98s)]
*  We have the result of a concerted political project that is attached to the Republican [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  Party that started 40 years ago for political reasons. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=316.7s)]
*  And I know there's a lot to say about the court and the reasoning of today's ruling [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=321.86s)]
*  and the individual justices who did this, and indeed the individual states and what [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=327.18s)]
*  their new laws are and how fast the curtain is coming down. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=331.58000000000004s)]
*  And we are going to do some of that over the course of this hour. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=334.02000000000004s)]
*  But I think to know where we are and to know what's coming next here, we have to get [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  real about who did this and how they did it, because this is part of a political project. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=341.06s)]
*  This is a 40 years in the making project for a big, well-staffed, well-funded, very radical [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=347.62s)]
*  project of the American political right and the Republican Party. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=354.70000000000005s)]
*  And I say it's very radical on purpose. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=359.1s)]
*  I mean that both in terms of its aims. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=361.38s)]
*  We're seeing that today, but also in terms of its tactics. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=363.34s)]
*  It is impolite to say this, I know, but the anti-abortion wing of the conservative movement [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=366.42s)]
*  and the Republican Party has long had an armed wing, a terrorist wing that has killed a lot [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=371.02s)]
*  of Americans in the past few decades and set off a lot of bombs for terroristic purposes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=378.74s)]
*  And that is terrible and criminal. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=384.86s)]
*  But it is undeniable that that is part of how the extreme right has approached their [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=387.5s)]
*  role in this issue and how to get what they want on this issue over these past 40 years. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=392.38s)]
*  That has existed alongside the well-staffed, well-funded, well-organized advocacy groups [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=398.58s)]
*  and think tanks and campus groups. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=403.78s)]
*  The anti-abortion political project of the Republican Party and the political right has [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=408.38s)]
*  been the central organizing principle for the right's entire effort around the judiciary, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=414.1s)]
*  one for which there is still no match or mirror on the left. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=419.18s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=423.38s)]
*  It's a big, now, multi-generational, again, well-funded, tightly organized and extremely, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=424.38s)]
*  extremely militant American political project. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=429.78000000000003s)]
*  And I think what's important to see today is that for them, this is not a movement that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=432.98s)]
*  just got what it wanted, now will go away. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=438.26000000000005s)]
*  This is a movement that they have been building for 40 years that is just now hitting its [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=441.42s)]
*  stride, that is just coming into maturity. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=446.74s)]
*  I mean, this is a movement that can claim six of the nine members of the Supreme Court. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=449.90000000000003s)]
*  We think of Chief Justice Roberts as the moderate justice among them. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=456.92s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=460.86s)]
*  When he was nominated, part of his bio was that he was the spouse of the leader of an [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=461.86s)]
*  anti-abortion organization. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=465.44s)]
*  I mean, the anti-abortion political project of the American right is a way of life for [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=467.08s)]
*  people on the American right. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=471.8s)]
*  It is an industry. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=473.12s)]
*  It's an employer. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=474.12s)]
*  It's a big movement that has succeeded now, as of today, at the first top of the list [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=475.12s)]
*  thing they wanted to do. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=479.52s)]
*  Why do you think they would stop now? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMh43GhLdGc&t=481.24s)]
