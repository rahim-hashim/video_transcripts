# 'An inflection point in history': Maddow on Kamala Harris' historic DNC speech
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc)
*  All right, you will remember where you were when you heard this speech tonight from the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=0.0s)]
*  vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris, really introducing herself to the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=4.2s)]
*  nation, speaking as much to Republicans and independents as she was to the Democrats who [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=8.36s)]
*  were nominating her tonight, asking Americans to remember how great their country is and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=13.16s)]
*  to fight for its values. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=18.64s)]
*  You're going to remember where you were on this night. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=21.2s)]
*  This is an inflection point in history. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=23.84s)]
*  Ari, we haven't asked you yet what you thought of the speech. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=26.0s)]
*  What was your take? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=29.16s)]
*  For years we've known her as the vice president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=30.68s)]
*  Tonight America got to meet her for the role she's actually played most of her career, as [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=33.2s)]
*  she said, representing the people. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=37.68s)]
*  It was a home run of a speech and what we heard was her give the opening statement. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=39.72s)]
*  I knew you were going to say that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=45.56s)]
*  Well, that's what she did. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=47.6s)]
*  Here's who I am. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Here's where I come from. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=50.44s)]
*  That's my opening of my values and who I am. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=51.96s)]
*  And she made the case, and she made it, as some of our experts also said, more directly, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=54.2s)]
*  more bluntly against Donald Trump than we've heard throughout this inclusive and joyous [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  convention. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=63.84s)]
*  And I think she needed to do that because that's what candidates do. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=64.84s)]
*  And so for all the joy, she hit him hard. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=67.28s)]
*  Legally she spoke about January 6th, democracy, fraud. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=70.2s)]
*  She also made a point to say something that's legally true, that he has been found legally [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  liable for sexual abuse. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  That is something that fewer people have said from the main stage. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=83.0s)]
*  That again is the commelator, as we know, from being the tough prosecutor. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=85.96s)]
*  She's the right person to say it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=89.52s)]
*  And then third, we got the closing argument. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=90.52s)]
*  And that broadened back out to, we can do this together. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=94.28s)]
*  I'm proud to be American. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=97.16s)]
*  We're not going back, which we've heard before. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=98.88s)]
*  And so we got in each of those chapters what you would get from her in the courtroom, and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=100.68s)]
*  she's good at it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=104.6s)]
*  Steph, sorry. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=105.6s)]
*  Go ahead, Simone. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=106.6s)]
*  Can I just say one other point is that if you have heard her before and you've followed [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=107.6s)]
*  giving, some of it sounded familiar. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=111.32s)]
*  But this had to be done in this way because most people at home are not watching as closely [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=113.27999999999999s)]
*  as we are. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  They have not heard her. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  And so there was stuff that harkened back to things that I had heard her say when I [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  worked for her in the vice president's office, things that she said in her first presidential [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=123.88s)]
*  campaign, things that if you go and you look up speeches and things that she'd given in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=127.28s)]
*  the United States Senate. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=131.84s)]
*  This was a speech that pulled from every single piece of her career, all of the past that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  she had walked up until this moment. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=138.28s)]
*  And I will say she also wasn't wearing white. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  There were lots of folks who were wearing white tonight. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=143.56s)]
*  When I was down there at the convention, they talked about wearing white and Fannie Lou Hamer, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=145.96s)]
*  this moment, the history. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  Vice President Harris is somebody that is not enamored with the history that she could [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  potentially make. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=156.72s)]
*  She's been the first in many of the things that she's done throughout her career. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=157.72s)]
*  To me, her choice of what to wear today also said that I am about my business and that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=160.44s)]
*  there's still work that needs to be done and we're going to wear the white if we win. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=166.72s)]
*  What's interesting when you look at the whole speech, it's like as she goes through it, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  she responds to her critics, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=176.0s)]
*  So when you're hearing her background and to your point, people could say, well, I heard [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=177.66s)]
*  that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  She then walks you through national security, foreign policy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  And then when she's taking you back to January 6th, the critic who's saying, well, that's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=185.68s)]
*  history. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=189.44s)]
*  Then she takes you forward and says, we will be guided by optimism and faith and we're [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=190.44s)]
*  going to fight for it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=195.72s)]
*  So those people are leaving the room with an assignment of what they're going to do [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=197.24s)]
*  next. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=201.16s)]
*  As opposed to the RNC, the RNC was basically like an inauguration celebration. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=202.16s)]
*  They were like, we won this, we got this, let's go home, we're in charge now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=208.44s)]
*  People didn't leave the RNC with an assignment. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=212.76s)]
*  They left the RNC like, well, we got it now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=215.04s)]
*  Everyone who's watched or participated, my phone is filled with people tonight saying, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=218.68s)]
*  I am charged up, let's go do this thing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=222.84s)]
*  And we heard this assignment from Michelle Obama, from Oprah Winfrey and from Vice President [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=225.0s)]
*  Harris tonight. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=229.16s)]
*  And that's where they appear to be going for the next 70 days. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=230.16s)]
*  The number of people looping back to Michelle Obama's speech saying, do something. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=232.16s)]
*  As Michelle Obama said, do something, do something. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=235.48s)]
*  That's not the tagline they intended for the convention, but it landed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=238.92s)]
*  That speech was such a knockout. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=241.88s)]
*  And it landed as her sort of insistent call and response moment in that speech, that that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=244.12s)]
*  actually is a great thing for people to be able to take away with them as they go home. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=250.68s)]
*  I also just, just to linger on what you just said, Simone, I think it's pretty wild to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=254.72s)]
*  think about, right? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=259.16s)]
*  We saw the way that Barack Obama extremely deftly navigated, I mean, at a level that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=260.52s)]
*  will be written about for 100 years hence, right? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=266.08s)]
*  About the politics of race and becoming the first black man to be president of the United [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=268.6s)]
*  States. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=271.68s)]
*  Even the line, like, they said it couldn't be done. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=273.18s)]
*  It's like, well, what's it? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=274.76s)]
*  What is it? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=275.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=276.76s)]
*  But he never says it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=277.76s)]
*  He just says, they said it couldn't be done. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=278.76s)]
*  It's like, okay, we get it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=279.76s)]
*  There was nothing in the speech tonight. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=280.88s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, nothing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=284.12s)]
*  Not one word, not one illusion, not a hint, not anything about the epic history that would [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=286.4s)]
*  be made by Kamala Harris being the president of the United States. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=293.76s)]
*  Not a wisp of it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=296.36s)]
*  Very smart. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=297.36s)]
*  And even more than Obama, who was much more wink, wink, nudge, nudge about it, that they, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=298.36s)]
*  you know, this was like about my business. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=303.52s)]
*  This was like none of it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=305.52s)]
*  But this was, I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but what I heard you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=307.8s)]
*  saying is, yeah, y'all, everybody can wear white. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  Everybody can talk about what this means for history and looking back and everything. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=314.72s)]
*  But the way we're going to make history here is by me becoming president. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm going to show you I can be president by the fact that I basically already am president [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=321.6s)]
*  in some ways. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  I am vice president. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm doing the work. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  This is what a president looks like. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to make this as easy as possible for you to imagine because I'm already living [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=330.76s)]
*  it and doing this job. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=334.24s)]
*  Rachel is my translator. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=335.24s)]
*  That is it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=336.24s)]
*  That is exactly it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=337.24s)]
*  I mean, let's just put a finer point on it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=338.24s)]
*  This current Republican Party apparatus, the culture wars are not just a distraction. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=341.8s)]
*  They are the playbook. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=345.48s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=346.48s)]
*  And so Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, they would love nothing more than for the vice president [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=347.48s)]
*  to stand on that stage and say, elect me because you will make history. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  She's not saying that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=355.32s)]
*  She's saying, elect me for all of these other reasons. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=356.32s)]
*  Elect me because I'm decent, because I'll fight for you, because I know what needs to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=359.0s)]
*  be done, because I respect America. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZBFf3AHxwc&t=362.2s)]
