# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 15
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec)
*  On the first day of the war, Russian forces took control of a nearby airport, a military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=0.0s)]
*  airport, leading many people to believe that Kiev would fall shortly thereafter. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=5.16s)]
*  But the front lines near that airport outside of Kiev, while fluid, have not moved considerably [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=11.42s)]
*  in two weeks. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=16.78s)]
*  The Washington Post reports that Ukrainian forces have taken the shrewd approach of retreating [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=19.06s)]
*  to the cities, conserving their weaponry and focusing on defending their positions in those [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=23.44s)]
*  cities instead of attacking. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=29.36s)]
*  They've blown up bridges. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=31.4s)]
*  They've lined the roads into the city with obstacles, while still managing to keep corridors [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=32.96s)]
*  open for fleeing civilians. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=37.0s)]
*  And they say they are ready for any Russian advance that comes their way. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=39.24s)]
*  Joining us now from Kiev, Sudarsan Raghavan, correspondent at large for the Washington [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=45.64s)]
*  Post, whom I am happy to announce as of tonight, is an MSNBC contributor. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=50.04s)]
*  Sudarsan, thank you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Welcome to the team. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Tell us more about this, because I was just speaking to people, including Richard Engel, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  who is explaining that this tactic that the Ukrainian army, that none of us would have [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=62.36s)]
*  known or thought would be that strategic or prepared, given their history in that country, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  has been remarkably effective against a much bigger, much more mighty army. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=73.16s)]
*  Great to be with you, Ali. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm glad to be an MSNBC contributor. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, look, everyone expected the Russians to have entered Kiev by now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=85.08s)]
*  But what we're seeing is an unbelievably stiff resistance by the Ukrainian forces. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=91.32s)]
*  And it is a very smart move. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=97.28s)]
*  They understand that they don't have the type of the massive weaponry, the Russian staff. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=99.12s)]
*  So what instead they're doing is they have retreated back to the cities. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=103.92s)]
*  They're using guerrilla-style tactics. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=107.24s)]
*  They've dug trenches in places like Irpin, which is a city just north of, on the northern [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=109.92s)]
*  edges of the capital of Kiev, and a key gateway into the city that the Russians are trying [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=116.2s)]
*  to push through. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=120.64s)]
*  They are inside people's houses. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  They are behind trees positioned, camouflaged, and ready for the Ukrainians to come down [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=125.28s)]
*  streets. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=133.68s)]
*  What they've told me they're being helped by is Russia's own unpreparedness, the Russian [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=135.68s)]
*  soldiers' lack of understanding of the geography of the Ukrainian terrain. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=142.6s)]
*  There have been examples of Russians running out of food and other supplies, on gas as [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=148.32s)]
*  well, turning down wrong streets inside Irpin, and then suddenly getting targeted by an anti-tank [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  missile. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=164.24s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, definitely the Ukrainians are using the smart. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=165.24s)]
*  And the other thing they're not doing is they're not counterattacking. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  So there's this one place where I was, one frontline a couple of days ago, in which it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=172.96s)]
*  was shelled by the Russians at least 20 or 25 times during the night. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=177.88s)]
*  And the Ukrainians told me they didn't reply once because they didn't want to conserve [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  their weaponry. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  But at the same time, they didn't want to turn that frontline into a battle zone because [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=190.4s)]
*  civilians were fleeing along that very road. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  And so when I asked them what happens if at some point if Russian tanks do come through, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=199.76s)]
*  then one of the commanders went and grabbed an En-Law anti-tank missile, which was inside [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=205.0s)]
*  a warehouse, and basically said, we're ready. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=210.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=214.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=215.68s)]
*  One of the, you know, a lot of the people I'm talking to, particularly these members [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=216.68s)]
*  of parliament who have taken up arms and joined the civilian militias, they're talking about [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=219.16s)]
*  their morale. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=223.72s)]
*  And the morale has kept that country alive far larger than U.S. intelligence thought [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=224.72s)]
*  it would survive a Russian onslaught. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=229.4s)]
*  On the other side, there's an argument that there's a lack of morale for those Russian [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=231.76s)]
*  soldiers who are sort of less clear about why they're fighting, combined with the fact [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  that they're in unfamiliar territory and they're getting into urban warfare with people who [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=239.96s)]
*  know the local terrain. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=243.66s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=245.78s)]
*  Now, you've got to understand that, you know, before the war started, actually even now, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=246.78s)]
*  I mean, there's an intense propaganda by the Kremlin, and that's reaching these Russian [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=251.86s)]
*  soldiers. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=257.98s)]
*  They actually thought at one point that the Ukrainians are going to welcome them with [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=258.98s)]
*  flowers. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=263.02s)]
*  That was all over social media. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=264.02s)]
*  Instead, so, you know, so they were expecting pretty much of an easy fight coming in. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=266.58s)]
*  Instead, what they found is a very strong resistance that's not only including the military, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=270.82s)]
*  but also civilians. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=279.34s)]
*  You know, they've joined by the thousands to participate in resisting the Russian forces. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=280.34s)]
*  And they're doing this in many different ways. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=288.53999999999996s)]
*  Many have joined these territorial defense units who are now posted at checkpoints all [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=290.7s)]
*  around Kiev, as well as fighting inside Erpin in that area. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=295.85999999999996s)]
*  But they, you know, but it's more than that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=301.9s)]
*  I mean, some of the soldiers in Erpin were telling me that they're actually getting information [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=304.14s)]
*  from civilians wherever there was cell phone network, which is it's scanned. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=309.46s)]
*  But there are some areas where people still call out of Erpin, and they were giving positions [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=313.5s)]
*  of Russian tanks and artillery so that the Ukrainians can then use their own weaponry [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=318.05999999999995s)]
*  to target them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  So it's a it's a it's a very cohesive resistance and it's involving not just the military, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=325.38s)]
*  but civilians as well. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=332.18s)]
*  One of the people working side by side with President Zelensky as he directs the country's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=334.74s)]
*  war effort and tries to rally support from Western allies is Sergey Leschenko, who currently [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=338.84s)]
*  serves as an advisor to President Zelensky's chief of staff. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  And joining us now is Sergey Leschenko. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=350.04s)]
*  Mr. Leschenko, thank you for making time for us tonight. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=352.38s)]
*  Today, President Zelensky spoke to the Canadian Parliament tomorrow. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=355.73999999999995s)]
*  He's going to address the U.S. Congress. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=359.06s)]
*  What does the president want to achieve in talking to U.S. lawmakers tomorrow? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  Our president want to have the coalition to support Ukraine in this brutal war started [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=367.58s)]
*  by Russia. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=373.7s)]
*  We need weapons. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=375.21999999999997s)]
*  We need military support on the ground, but especially on the air. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=376.46s)]
*  We called for closing the sky to have non-flying zone over Ukraine to stop bombing of Ukrainian [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=381.14000000000004s)]
*  cities. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=388.46000000000004s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have negative answer from our partners. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=389.46000000000004s)]
*  Then we called to provide us Soviet fighter jets, which are now based in our neighbor [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=394.06s)]
*  countries, which are members of NATO. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=400.74s)]
*  But unfortunately, this operation was not succeed as well. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=403.90000000000003s)]
*  Today, we are calling for more anti-aircraft support because what you see on the ground, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=408.54s)]
*  Russia is quite weak. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=414.14s)]
*  Their army is not powerful. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=416.26s)]
*  Their army is just big and long, but they have powerful aircraft, powerful fighters, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=418.22s)]
*  powerful bombing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=425.5s)]
*  And they destroyed a lot of Ukrainian cities. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=426.5s)]
*  They started to attack Kiev starting from the weekend. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=429.34s)]
*  They bombed our not just neighborhoods of Kiev, but city of Kiev itself. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=433.70000000000005s)]
*  And to stop this, we need support on the sky. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=440.1s)]
*  And unfortunately, so today we have very weak answer from our partners on this topic. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=443.90000000000003s)]
*  That is why president going to address the issue for American lawmakers and American [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=449.94000000000005s)]
*  citizens to call for unity, to call for solidarity, to call for humanism, to provide more support [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=454.86s)]
*  for Ukraine. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=462.1s)]
*  I very much appreciate all support done by American citizens, American government for [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=463.14000000000004s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=467.98s)]
*  But as president told today to British prime minister, the support provided us for a week. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=468.98s)]
*  We spend the support during 20 hours. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=476.70000000000005s)]
*  We need more weapons to defend our country. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=479.5s)]
*  One of the problems, Mr. Leshchenko, is that NATO countries are saying that Ukraine is [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=485.5s)]
*  not a NATO member. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=491.14000000000004s)]
*  Today, when he addressed the EU leaders, President Zelensky appeared to give up on the prospect [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=492.58s)]
*  of Ukraine ever joining NATO. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=498.26s)]
*  Ukraine's constitution commits Ukraine to actually pursuing membership in NATO. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=501.29999999999995s)]
*  So why did that happen? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=505.38s)]
*  Why did the president say he thinks that Ukraine is not going to join NATO, which is exactly [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=506.41999999999996s)]
*  what Vladimir Putin wants? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=513.3s)]
*  I cannot commend president to what he said. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=516.54s)]
*  This is his legal right to say. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=519.26s)]
*  But you know what is going on in Ukraine now. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=521.98s)]
*  It's the war. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=524.46s)]
*  And Ukraine expected to have more support from our partners, especially in this critical [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=525.86s)]
*  moment because Ukraine not just fighting for ourselves. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=530.42s)]
*  Ukraine is fighting for Europe. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=534.66s)]
*  We defend Europe from Russia because, believe me, Russia will not stop on Ukraine. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=536.42s)]
*  Russia will expand their power toward European countries, toward Baltic countries, Poland. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  So members of NATO. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=548.26s)]
*  The idea of Putin is not just to occupy Ukraine or to make this denatification of Ukraine [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=549.86s)]
*  or demilitarization of Ukraine as he announced. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=555.9399999999999s)]
*  His goal is to destroy the global order created after the Second World War in Yalta, which [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=559.3s)]
*  is occupied by the way, was occupied eight years ago by Russia. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=564.66s)]
*  That is why Ukraine is calling for support from our partners to provide the weapons which [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=569.8199999999999s)]
*  we are looking for. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=575.46s)]
*  Unfortunately, the answer is very weak. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=577.0200000000001s)]
*  And the argument is that if we as a NATO members provide this weapons to Ukraine, we will escalate. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=579.0600000000001s)]
*  We will provoke Russia more. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=586.7800000000001s)]
*  But my question is, if you as our partners afraid to provide us this weapons because [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=589.86s)]
*  Russia can be nervous, will you accept our application to NATO, which makes Russia crazy? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=597.94s)]
*  It looks like you're not going to do this. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=605.9s)]
*  It looks like we are living in like a in a dream, you know, but it's time to wake up [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=607.7s)]
*  because we are losing our country. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=613.38s)]
*  We are losing our people. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=614.9s)]
*  We are losing our economy. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=615.9s)]
*  And we have to find the form of our guarantees, of our sovereignty, of our integrity, of our [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=617.78s)]
*  security. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=624.02s)]
*  Because without these guarantees, this war can happen again and again. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=627.42s)]
*  That is why the idea of negotiation now is to find the formula of this security guarantees. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=631.62s)]
*  Can be security guarantees from our neighbor countries, can be security guarantees from [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=637.98s)]
*  our guarantors from Budapest Memorandum 1994, when Ukraine stopped nuclear program as a [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=642.34s)]
*  post-Soviet country. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=651.34s)]
*  And this Budapest Memorandum was just lame duck, not able to defend Ukraine. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=653.94s)]
*  So this is a part of negotiation now. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=659.58s)]
*  But the problem is that Ukraine is living in the state of war three weeks already, and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=661.74s)]
*  we are looking for more support from our partners. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=668.0200000000001s)]
*  Sergey Leschenko is the current adviser to President Zelensky's chief of staff. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=671.26s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=678.34s)]
*  On a busy street in Budapest, past a steel gate in a building you'd have no reason to [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=680.82s)]
*  notice is a soft landing for families fleeing Ukraine, where in spite of all they've been [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=686.06s)]
*  through, we found smiles. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=691.8199999999999s)]
*  We actually had this idea in our mind that we would host them in our home, but it was [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=693.86s)]
*  clear that 11 people can't fit there. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=699.9399999999999s)]
*  What Budapest couples Zsuzsanna Uy and Peter Fadesz did have was a second flat under renovation. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  You can see it's not quite finished, but with a little love, this house is becoming a home [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=709.72s)]
*  for Ukrainians who have lost their own. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=715.1s)]
*  Many friends offered food and preparing hot food, and we got washing power and medicine [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=717.58s)]
*  and everything that they need. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=726.54s)]
*  One day we got mattresses and pillows. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=729.1s)]
*  19 people have already filtered through. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=732.9s)]
*  There's no rush to leave. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=736.1800000000001s)]
*  Alexandra Zygilenko landed here with her family and a friend, Rosanna, who also has a daughter. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=737.7s)]
*  So we stay here, I don't remember, four or five, maybe days. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=744.62s)]
*  Their journey to Budapest first took them through Moldova and Romania before a train [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=750.74s)]
*  brought them here. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=755.44s)]
*  I hope it will be good in future, but we want to go home. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=757.38s)]
*  My husband told us stay here or there, not in Ukraine. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=766.9s)]
*  Because the war will not stop for a few days. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=775.3s)]
*  Like so many we've met, her family is not complete. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=781.22s)]
*  Alexandra only sees her husband now in photos, clinging to her phone with hope they will [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=785.4s)]
*  be reunited. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=789.62s)]
*  Maybe they open the border from all women, children, men. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=791.58s)]
*  My husband told me if they open, he will come to us, if it will be possible. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=797.82s)]
*  With her friend Rosanna and their children, they want to make it to Prague. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=807.14s)]
*  For now, this half-finished home is a respite and a reminder. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=810.94s)]
*  I think they are our guests now, and maybe I will be their guest tomorrow. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=815.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's always a threat. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=822.14s)]
*  The global situation is so fragile and the peace is so fragile. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=826.8199999999999s)]
*  So we always think about this, that we can be in their place anytime. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=831.18s)]
*  So far, that Budapest couple has helped 19 of the nearly 270,000 Ukrainian refugees who [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=840.62s)]
*  fled to Hungary as war wages in their country. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=846.54s)]
*  The couple was happy to make their half-finished flat a place where Ukrainian refugees could [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=849.42s)]
*  rest, recover, and figure out their next steps. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=854.18s)]
*  Already, a few of their guests have moved on to join family in Western European countries. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=856.66s)]
*  The hosts say it is the least they can do. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=861.26s)]
*  Already, more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine, and they all need this kind of help [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=863.38s)]
*  and hospitality as they figure out their next steps. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=868.62s)]
*  This is video out of Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=873.1s)]
*  Today, the mayor of Kharkiv said that more than 600 buildings have been destroyed since [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=877.02s)]
*  the Russian invasion began and that the near-constant Russian shelling and airstrikes have hit hospitals [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=882.1s)]
*  and government buildings and have completely destroyed 48 schools. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=888.26s)]
*  Yesterday alone, the Ukrainian government counted 65 instances of Russian shelling in [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=894.02s)]
*  the city, but the people of Kharkiv are amazingly resilient. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=898.94s)]
*  I want you to see this video that was shot yesterday in Kharkiv. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=902.9s)]
*  Let the people take me home [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=932.9s)]
*  That, of course, was Take On Me by the Norwegian 80s synth-pop group Aha, performed entirely [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=941.86s)]
*  with traditional Ukrainian instruments in a basement in Kharkiv. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=948.5s)]
*  Ten people and a cat are sheltering from the near-constant Russian shelling in that basement, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=953.4599999999999s)]
*  But rather than just hiding, this band, Selo and Ludy, has been putting on concerts and [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=958.7s)]
*  streaming them live on Facebook, using joy and music as an act of resistance. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=964.02s)]
*  This is the band leader, Alexander Gonsharov's home, which was destroyed by Russian shelling, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=970.66s)]
*  and yet he plays on. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=976.02s)]
*  Joining us now from that basement in Kharkiv is Alexander Gonsharov, the band leader of [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=978.14s)]
*  Selo and Ludy. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=982.52s)]
*  Alexander, thank you for being with us. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=984.1s)]
*  I have never been in a place where my home has been bombed, and I'm not sure how I would [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=986.26s)]
*  react if that had happened to me. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=990.58s)]
*  Your reaction is entirely surprising. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=993.34s)]
*  You have gone somewhere else with your bandmates and a cat, and you are continuing to perform [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=995.46s)]
*  and putting smiles on people's faces. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1000.58s)]
*  Just tell me about how this has all come to be. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1002.74s)]
*  Well, it was my first time when my home was bombed, so I didn't have such experience either. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1008.14s)]
*  I understand your astonishment that this is the first time I react to such things. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1014.5s)]
*  But what wasn't new to me, well, I was aware that the war was coming. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1022.42s)]
*  The most part of Ukrainian citizens, well, when it comes to such a horror, people tend [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1032.62s)]
*  to stay in denial. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1039.3s)]
*  Since the war is going on for more than eight years in Ukraine, it started in 2014, well, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1044.14s)]
*  many people wouldn't just notice that because, well, it was somewhere to the east, some small [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1053.78s)]
*  part of Ukraine only was occupied. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1060.42s)]
*  It's like I was a little bit prepared for that. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1064.1s)]
*  And when we were looking for... [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1068.06s)]
*  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1069.86s)]
*  I was going to say some might say that playing concerts in a war is denial, but it's not [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1074.34s)]
*  for you. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1080.4199999999998s)]
*  It's resistance, right? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1081.4199999999998s)]
*  You are doing something here for the morale of you and your bandmates and the people who [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1082.4199999999998s)]
*  listen to your live streams. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1087.8s)]
*  Well, I cannot 100% exclude that I also do have some of denial. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1089.7s)]
*  Well, it's not only denial. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1097.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's about resistance. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1099.6599999999999s)]
*  It's about, well, to save the energy, our energy, people's energy, to give support, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1101.3s)]
*  to share support, to stand strong. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1110.82s)]
*  Because well, recent streams, we were mostly talking, not just playing music like we did [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1115.8999999999999s)]
*  before, because many people write the words of support and they are inspired by the fact [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1123.02s)]
*  that we are alive, that we are able to play. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1129.74s)]
*  And so now the war is not only in our house, it actually touched all the world. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1133.1s)]
*  And I see that all the world is scared. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1139.1399999999999s)]
*  And well, we've done that before, inspiring the soldiers at the front line during these [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1141.78s)]
*  eight years, visiting the soldiers and playing music for them. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1148.5s)]
*  And that is the part of my life when I realized that what we do is important because, well, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1152.3799999999999s)]
*  it wasn't always so. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1158.8999999999999s)]
*  I wasn't planning to become a musician. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1160.74s)]
*  It was a hobby. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1162.9399999999998s)]
*  But then when you see some things happen and you understand that it's something important [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1164.6599999999999s)]
*  and it's something that you can share with. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1170.54s)]
*  It's hard to smile in times like this, but watching your video brought a smile to my [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm027aFwsec&t=1175.6599999999999s)]
