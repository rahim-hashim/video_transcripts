# How RFK Jr. became associated with a deadly, preventable disease
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4)
*  This is the biggest increase in deaths we've seen since records began. The figure of 32 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=0.0s)]
*  dead is up from 25 only yesterday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=6.28s)]
*  These hospitals aren't designed to deal with this and I think the minute you're getting [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=9.0s)]
*  hospitals running at 200-300% capacity, I think that speaks for itself. It's incredibly [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=11.76s)]
*  serious. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=15.84s)]
*  That was an Australian news station reporting from the island nation of Samoa in 2019. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=16.84s)]
*  And if it seems familiar, it may look and sound like the kind of news reports we saw [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=24.4s)]
*  from all over the world in 2020 during the global COVID pandemic. But this was not about [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=30.08s)]
*  COVID. And this all happened before COVID. This was 2019, this outbreak in Samoa. It [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=35.92s)]
*  killed more than 80 people, many of them young kids. The government had to order lockdowns [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  to try to save people's lives. Charities from around the world had to ship children's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=47.2s)]
*  coffins to Samoa to deal with a shortage of coffins there for all the little kids and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=52.32s)]
*  babies who were dying. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=57.28s)]
*  What Samoa was experiencing in 2019 was an epidemic of measles, a preventable epidemic. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=60.0s)]
*  And I say that because measles is a disease for which there has been an effective vaccine [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=67.0s)]
*  available for more than 60 years. That entirely preventable disease outbreak in Samoa in 2019 [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=72.16s)]
*  is now newly relevant because one of the factors that contributed to that outbreak was a sudden [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=80.08s)]
*  onset of hostility to vaccination on the island. And that hostility was stoked in large part [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=85.8s)]
*  by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Donald Trump has just tapped to lead the Department of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=92.52s)]
*  Health and Human Services. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=97.64s)]
*  Kennedy's anti-vaccine organization, Children's Health Defense, very aggressively spread anti-vaccine [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=100.24s)]
*  propaganda not only in the United States, but around the world. And in Samoa, they claimed [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=106.76s)]
*  that the measles vaccine itself was the cause of the outbreak and not the solution to it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=112.12s)]
*  R.F.K. Jr. personally lobbied the governor of Samoa, telling the governor that vaccination [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=119.12s)]
*  was what caused the spread of measles, not what needed to be done to stop the spread [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  of it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's insane. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=132.64s)]
*  As journalist Brian Deer writes in a new op-ed for the New York Times today, quote, I was [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  in Samoa during that outbreak as part of my more than 16 years of reporting on the anti-vaccine [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=140.11999999999998s)]
*  movement. The cause of the outbreak was not the vaccine, but most likely an infected traveler [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  who brought the virus from New Zealand, which that year had the biggest measles outbreaks [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  in decades, especially among that country's indigenous and Pacific Islander communities. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=153.6s)]
*  Migration and poverty were likely factors in a sudden spread of measles in Samoa and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=158.52s)]
*  in New Zealand. But as an editorial in the New Zealand Medical Journal reported, so too [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=163.0s)]
*  was a factor that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. specializes in, quote, increasing circulation of misinformation, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=167.96s)]
*  leading to distrust and reduced vaccination uptake. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=175.68s)]
*  Joining us now is Brian Deer. He's a journalist and the author of the book The Doctor Who [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Fooled the World about the anti-vaccine movement. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  Mr. Deer, I really appreciate you taking time to join us today. Thank you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=188.64s)]
*  Pleasure, Rachel. Nice to be here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=191.72s)]
*  I think that since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. associated himself both with this presidential election, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=194.92s)]
*  first as an independent candidate and then secondly with Donald Trump, now especially [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=201.64s)]
*  since he's been put forward for this very powerful health post, I think Americans have [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  started to hear about his very troubling role in this deadly outbreak in Samoa. But I still [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  think the concept of it, the idea of it, is fuzzy to a lot of people. Can you describe [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=216.32s)]
*  to us the nature of the outbreak, how severe it was, and why he's associated with it and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=220.52s)]
*  thought to be potentially partially responsible for the death toll? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=225.12s)]
*  Well, the plot thickens from what you were saying a moment ago in that it's almost certain [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=229.0s)]
*  that the virus got into Samoa by flight from Auckland. And just a little while before that, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=238.04s)]
*  Friends of Kennedy had been in Auckland, in New Zealand, with a film which had been [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=248.64s)]
*  promoted in the United States by Robert De Niro and got a lot of attention in the United [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=255.64s)]
*  States, which was suggesting that there was fraud at the CDC in Atlanta. There actually [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=260.0s)]
*  wasn't. But so they'd been touring in Auckland, South Auckland, where a lot of Pacific [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=266.24s)]
*  Islander communities there, which became very, very susceptible. It was there that that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  year New Zealand saw the biggest outbreak of measles in decades. So it was no surprise [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=279.88s)]
*  really that that virus did get onto an aircraft and got its way out to Samoa. And Mr. Kennedy [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=286.44s)]
*  really has questions to answer about his relationship with the people who made that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=292.92s)]
*  film. It was called Vaxed and Mr. Kennedy became the executive producer of sequel Vaxed [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=299.24s)]
*  2 and was a close colleague of the people who went out to New Zealand and also to Australia [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=305.72s)]
*  to promote fear of vaccines. So that's where it came from. And the catastrophic consequences [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=312.6s)]
*  that I witnessed on the island, I spent much of a week of the time I was there just simply [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  talking to mothers about the loss of their children. And it was really awful to listen [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  to them. And I found myself at the end of it all just sitting in a cathedral and crying [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=332.56s)]
*  and crying. Couldn't stop crying as the accumulation of pain from these mothers really [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=338.44s)]
*  consumed me. It was awful. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  Why would somebody like R.F.K. Junior have influence in a place like Samoa as to whether [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  or not people vaccinated their kids? Why would his influence in particular be something that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=354.8s)]
*  sort of perniciously accelerated the risk there? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=361.68s)]
*  Well, his name opens doors. He's always known that. I mean, he's really not a lot more than [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=366.2s)]
*  his name, is he? He's not a particularly good lawyer. He pays himself the last time I looked [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=371.44s)]
*  five hundred thousand dollars, half a million dollars a year to run Children's Health Defense, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=377.2s)]
*  which he set up himself. But he's not a particularly distinguished man in his own right. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=383.68s)]
*  But he got out to Samoa. He went to visit them. He went to see the prime minister. And as [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=388.96s)]
*  you say, tried to convince the prime minister that it was, in fact, the vaccine that was [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=393.6s)]
*  causing the deaths and not the measles virus. Extraordinary thing to do. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=398.04s)]
*  But, you know, he's been making this kind of mischief for many years now. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=403.36s)]
*  Journalist and author Brian Deer, the author of The Doctor Who Fooled the World. Mr. Deer, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=408.8s)]
*  I appreciate you being with us for this, and I'd love to have you back to talk a few more [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  about this in the future, if you don't mind. Great. Thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=417.20000000000005s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKa4R-kHz4&t=428.04s)]
