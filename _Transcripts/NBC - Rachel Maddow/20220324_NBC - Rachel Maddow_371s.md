# Mounting Deaths Make Russian Censorship Of Ukraine War Harder To Maintain
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA)
*  The highly circulated Russian tabloid KP had an exclusive interview yesterday with the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=0.0s)]
*  former commander-in-chief of the Russian ground forces. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=5.66s)]
*  His take on Russia's invasion of Ukraine is something. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=9.4s)]
*  He says, quote, we are conducting a military humane operation, one might say surgical, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=13.1s)]
*  in order to save people's lives as much as possible. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=20.04s)]
*  Their houses, roads, bridges, factories, end quote. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  Hours after that interview published, Russia bombed one of the main bridges between Kiev [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=27.86s)]
*  and the city to its northeast. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=32.62s)]
*  Over the weekend, Russia bombed one of Europe's largest iron and steel factories in the Ukrainian [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=34.9s)]
*  port city of Mariupol. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=39.82s)]
*  As for the rest of Mariupol, Russian forces there have stopped advancing traditionally. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=42.34s)]
*  Instead, they are leveling the city from afar. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=47.66s)]
*  They're starving out the civilian population, denying them access to medical and humanitarian [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  supplies. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=55.42s)]
*  Russia is quite literally destroying Ukrainian, quote, houses, roads, bridges, and factories, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=56.42s)]
*  end quote. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  On Monday, this same Russian tabloid newspaper ran an article saying that nearly 10,000 Russian [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=65.58s)]
*  troops had been killed in Ukraine. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=72.7s)]
*  Now, within hours, the article had been taken down. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=74.9s)]
*  The site published an advisory saying it had been hacked and the story was a fake. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=77.82000000000001s)]
*  Now keep in mind, 10,000 soldiers is much higher than the Russian government's last [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=84.42s)]
*  public announcement three weeks ago, which only mentioned a loss of 498 troops. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=88.86s)]
*  NATO's estimate is even higher than America's. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  It says up to 40,000 Russian troops have been killed, wounded, captured, or are missing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=98.1s)]
*  in action. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=103.78s)]
*  If any of these non-Russian estimates are correct, it's going to be hard to continue [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=105.54s)]
*  to keep that from the Russian people given images like this one. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=110.18s)]
*  This is a funeral for the deputy commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet yesterday in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=114.18s)]
*  Crimea. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=120.06s)]
*  The funeral is for just one of the dozens of high-level Russian officers that Ukraine [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=121.22000000000001s)]
*  claims they have killed so far. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=126.42s)]
*  Ukraine also claims to have killed six Russian generals, which is basically unheard of in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=128.86s)]
*  modern warfare. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=136.26000000000002s)]
*  At some point, no matter how much the Russian government tries to control the narrative, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=138.3s)]
*  are going to start noticing just how many military funerals there are and how many people [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=142.9s)]
*  they know who've lost loved ones, especially given the victories that we're continuing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=147.78s)]
*  to see from Ukrainian forces. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  Joining us now is Joshua Yaffa. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=154.5s)]
*  He's a correspondent for The New Yorker, based primarily in Moscow, but he was in Ukraine [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=155.86s)]
*  the moment Russian bombs started dropping, and he's done some incredible reporting from [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=160.3s)]
*  there since. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=164.5s)]
*  He's also the author of Between Two Fires, Truth, Ambition, and Compromise in Putin's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=165.5s)]
*  Russia. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  Joshua, thanks for being with us this evening. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=173.66s)]
*  I want to get a sense of, given that you've been inside Ukraine and then to Russia, Putin's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=174.82000000000002s)]
*  got a very tight grip on power in Russia. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=180.82000000000002s)]
*  Does it matter if Russian citizens learn the truth and turn against him? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=183.66000000000003s)]
*  Would it actually change something for Vladimir Putin's reality? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=188.18s)]
*  I think it certainly would change something for Vladimir Putin's reality if, as you say, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=191.78s)]
*  on mass were to learn the truth of this war, whether the degree of destruction of Ukrainian [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=197.70000000000002s)]
*  cities. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=204.22000000000003s)]
*  That's something certainly not talked about on Russian television. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=205.22000000000003s)]
*  This continues to be called a special military operation and official channels. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=207.74s)]
*  If you look at polling, many Russians believe that this is a limited military engagement [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=212.54000000000002s)]
*  in the east of the country, the Donbas region. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=217.94000000000003s)]
*  People aren't aware that Kiev is being bombed, Kharkiv is being bombed, Mariupol. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  You showed those terrible pictures of how destroyed that city is. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=226.22s)]
*  Many people don't know that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=229.7s)]
*  So if Russians were to learn, indeed, the war that is being fought in their name, what [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  it really looks like, the ugliness and horror of that war, I think many of them would be [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=235.01999999999998s)]
*  surprised, if not shocked, at how widespread the violence is against Ukrainian cities and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  against Ukrainian people. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=244.89999999999998s)]
*  And I think, of course, equally impactful could be the knowledge of how many Russian [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  soldiers are being killed in this war. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=251.54s)]
*  This estimate of 10,000 that we saw published in a Moscow paper the other day before it [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  was quickly retracted. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=258.74s)]
*  The question is, will they, not what the effect would be, but will they even learn of that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=260.5s)]
*  information? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=265.58s)]
*  And that, I think, is a bigger question so far since the beginning of the war and in [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=266.58s)]
*  the month since the war began, a month today. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=270.98s)]
*  In fact, a number, in fact, nearly all of the leading independent, not even opposition-minded, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=274.26s)]
*  really just any independent non-state-run, non-state-controlled sources of information [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=281.38s)]
*  in Russia have been blocked, shuttered. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=286.54s)]
*  Its journalists forced to leave the country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=289.62s)]
*  Websites taken down or blocked access to them, even social media, Facebook blocked, Instagram [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=292.34s)]
*  blocked. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=298.58s)]
*  So where will Russians learn that information from? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=299.58s)]
*  That's a really tricky question. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=302.26s)]
*  There are, of course, VPNs. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=304.06s)]
*  People are using them, but not everyone has that kind of technical ability. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=305.6s)]
*  Government regulators are also trying to go after VPN operators. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=310.46s)]
*  So really, it's a cat and mouse game with people left with not many sources where they [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=313.62s)]
*  could find out that sort of information. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=318.18s)]
*  And I think the reason that the Kremlin is being so diligent in going after these sources [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  of information and making sure that Russians don't have access to them is because they [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=325.7s)]
*  know that if en masse, in large numbers, Russians were to learn the truth about this war, it [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=329.29999999999995s)]
*  could be really destabilizing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=334.34s)]
*  But I'm just not sure that that turn of events will really come anytime soon, given the Kremlin's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=336.74s)]
*  control over the social, political, and media spheres. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=342.86s)]
*  And they may well succeed for some time in preventing this information from spreading [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=346.1s)]
*  more widely. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuBGslqbWA&t=350.02s)]
