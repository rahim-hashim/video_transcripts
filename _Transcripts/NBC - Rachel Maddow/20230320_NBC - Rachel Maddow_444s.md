Video Description: Rachel Maddow explains that while Americans and the U.S. system of government is able to function smoothly even as politicians at all levels are routinely indicted on a variety of crimes, the true danger is when that functioning justice system is attacked or corrupted, as Republicans are doing in an effort to protect Donald Trump.

# Trump indictment would only be a problem if he and GOP make it one (and they're trying)
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw)
*  He has called for massive protest in response to his expected arrest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=0.0s)]
*  There are certainly isolated calls for violence online among his supporters, what the Associated [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=4.96s)]
*  Press characterized today as incendiary but isolated calls for civil war and violence [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  and killing people. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=16.4s)]
*  But you do also have high-profile Trump supporters, like this guy, who we do have a mugshot of, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=20.78s)]
*  disgraced former New York police commissioner and convicted felon Bernie Carrick, now a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=27.68s)]
*  high-profile Trump supporter, he is now calling for law enforcement to mutiny, for law enforcement [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=31.28s)]
*  at all levels to refuse to enforce the law if there's any indictment against Donald [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=38.92s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=44.04s)]
*  He's also got lots of high-profile Trump supporters leaning on the governor of Florida, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=45.04s)]
*  saying that if Trump is indicted and he refuses to voluntarily turn himself in, then the Florida [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  governor, Ron DeSantis, should refuse law enforcement cooperation to extradite Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=55.32s)]
*  to New York to face charges, that DeSantis should call out the Florida National Guard [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  or something or have some other kind of state versus federal armed standoff where I guess [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=64.8s)]
*  Trump will hide indefinitely in his Florida house and then there'll be like a war or [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=70.54s)]
*  something I guess to try to stop him from being, from facing potential charges on falsification [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=76.44s)]
*  of business records. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=83.36s)]
*  The reason this stuff matters is because it's one thing to wish for, to try to use violence [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=86.96s)]
*  and intimidation to constrain prosecutors. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=94.28s)]
*  That is not something we do in this country, but I think nobody believes that's a Rubicon [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=98.28s)]
*  that former President Trump doesn't want to cross, not after January 6th. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=102.28s)]
*  He knows what intimidation and violence by his supporters can do for him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=106.2s)]
*  And so therefore we have to watch that closely and we're going to be watching very closely [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=113.76s)]
*  the logistics and the machinations of these possible prosecutions because he's calling [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=119.08s)]
*  for a large-scale protest, because we know he's not shy about the impact of violence [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=124.08s)]
*  potentially benefiting him and the impact of intimidation in terms of whether or not [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  it can constrain those who he perceives as his enemies. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=132.6s)]
*  We get that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=136.28s)]
*  What's worse than that though is if he wants to break the system, is if he wants to break [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=138.48s)]
*  the legal system in response to the legal system threatening him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=144.32s)]
*  And beyond just threatening violence, you know, that's something that all the other [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  hundreds, all the other thousands of public corruption indictments in this country have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=153.88s)]
*  not previously brought to our door. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=157.66s)]
*  But that is what not just former President Trump, but also Republicans more broadly are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=159.72s)]
*  playing with right now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=164.16s)]
*  I mean, right now we have Republicans in the state legislature in Georgia passing themselves [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=165.32s)]
*  a new law by which they empower themselves to remove prosecutors in the middle of cases [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  that the Republicans don't like. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=178.32s)]
*  Georgia Republicans have passed legislation to undo the independence of law enforcement [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=181.52s)]
*  in Georgia. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=188.38000000000002s)]
*  If that's what it takes to prevent the law being enforced against their leader. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  Today Trump's lawyers in Georgia filed a motion to have the prosecutor who's leading the investigation [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=197.5s)]
*  into Trump, they filed a motion to have her removed from that case, while the bill that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=201.62s)]
*  would allow Republicans in the state legislature to remove her from the case is on its way [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=205.98000000000002s)]
*  to that Republican governor's desk. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=210.02s)]
*  I mean, what do they think is going to be the outcome there in Georgia if they do this, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=211.74s)]
*  right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=215.58s)]
*  They just want to set a new standard, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=216.58s)]
*  As long as there are Republicans controlling the state legislature there, prosecutors in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  Georgia can only bring criminal charges against Democrats and not Republicans, because if [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=221.94000000000003s)]
*  you bring them against Republicans, the Republicans in the state legislature will take you out [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=227.66000000000003s)]
*  of your job. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=231.3s)]
*  I mean, that's the, is that what they're trying to set up? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=232.3s)]
*  Is that how they think things ought to work in Georgia? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=234.3s)]
*  That's how things ought to be changed in Georgia. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=236.46s)]
*  So they work like that now. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=238.46s)]
*  And the reason that change is justified is because, well, Donald Trump might get in trouble [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=240.34s)]
*  for some stuff. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=244.18s)]
*  It's one thing to not want your guy indicted. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=247.38000000000002s)]
*  It's another thing and a very bad thing to threaten violence and intimidation if your [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=251.10000000000002s)]
*  guy does get invited, indicted, excuse me. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=255.38000000000002s)]
*  But if your reaction to your guy potentially getting indicted is that you're going to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=259.02000000000004s)]
*  get rid of the system by which people get indicted. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=262.58000000000004s)]
*  That's a bigger problem for the whole country. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  And it's not just Georgia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=270.62s)]
*  Federally now, we have Republicans in Congress trying to summon the New York prosecutor to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=272.18s)]
*  Capitol Hill to give testimony as if they've got jurisdiction over him in this matter, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=277.46s)]
*  as if they, as Congress, can somehow constrain him from bringing New York state charges against [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=283.02s)]
*  an alleged criminal, as if they can somehow stop him from putting people on trial for [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=289.06s)]
*  allegedly breaking New York state law. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=294.38s)]
*  Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is making these threats against the New York [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=297.18s)]
*  prosecutor. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=300.98s)]
*  He's encouraging Republican members of Congress who lead congressional committees that they [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=302.02000000000004s)]
*  should haul in this New York prosecutor to try somehow to stop it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=306.02000000000004s)]
*  And so, yes, we're going to look at all of that tonight and we're going to get some [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=311.06s)]
*  expert help to try to understand it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=313.66s)]
*  But we can be clear eyed and confident here about what's new and what isn't. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=315.06s)]
*  About what poses a challenge to our system of government and what is our system of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=321.02000000000004s)]
*  government. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=325.14000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, we've all seen it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  Every time a public official gets charged with a crime, they get that look in their [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=329.7s)]
*  eye, right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=332.62s)]
*  They always say, oh, it's political persecution. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=333.62s)]
*  My enemies just have to get me because of my position on taxes or gay rights or tort [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=336.46s)]
*  reform or whatever. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=342.06s)]
*  Or they say it's only because I'm so effective as a champion of the people. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=343.06s)]
*  That's why they're after me. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=347.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, they all try that kind of an argument. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=348.53999999999996s)]
*  But they end up being memorable only for the quality of their mugshots. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=353.14s)]
*  Some of them get convicted, some of them get acquitted, some of them get charges dropped, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=357.3s)]
*  some of them keep committing more crimes and get superseding indictments laid on top of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  the initial charges. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=363.66s)]
*  And then we get two, two, two mugshots for the price of one. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=364.74s)]
*  But our system of government can handle it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  Our system of government can demonstrably and absolutely handle the prosecution of alleged [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=371.58000000000004s)]
*  crimes committed by public officials and former public officials. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=376.54s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=380.5s)]
*  It will not break us. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=382.22s)]
*  It does not break us. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=383.46000000000004s)]
*  Unless. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=385.1s)]
*  The political right, in its support of Donald Trump, decides that the prosecution of that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=387.94s)]
*  particular former public official is reason enough to break our system of government, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=393.82s)]
*  to break the legal system with not just threats of violence and intimidation, but by seizing [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=398.54s)]
*  partisan and political control of prosecutors' offices. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=403.54s)]
*  If former President Trump gets indicted, yes, it's unprecedented, but there is no [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=409.18s)]
*  inherent crisis in that for us as Americans. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=414.14s)]
*  Watch who tries to make it one. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9JjxJIBBw&t=418.14s)]
