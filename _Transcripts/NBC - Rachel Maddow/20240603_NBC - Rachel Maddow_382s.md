# More unpleasant legal surprises for Trump possible, newly revealed investigations suggest
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw)
*  All 16 electors have been advised by the governor staff that we're going to be here to vote [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=0.0s)]
*  in electoral college. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=4.4s)]
*  We've been checking. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=5.4s)]
*  We're already here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=6.4s)]
*  But these are the rest of the electors. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=7.4s)]
*  I understand. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=8.4s)]
*  But the Capitol is closed. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=9.4s)]
*  That was outside the Michigan state Capitol December 2020. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=14.56s)]
*  That scene ultimately led to the indictment of 16 alleged fake electors for Donald Trump [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  in Michigan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=22.8s)]
*  It led more recently to testimony in a Michigan state courtroom on Friday, this past Friday. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=23.8s)]
*  As reported in the Detroit News, that same officer who turned the fake electors away [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=29.9s)]
*  at the door to the state Capitol, he testified in court on Friday that he, quote, had been [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=34.82s)]
*  interviewed Thursday by someone from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and two U.S. prosecutors [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=39.739999999999995s)]
*  from Washington, D.C. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=45.18s)]
*  Thursday of course was also the day a jury in New York found Donald Trump guilty in a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=47.3s)]
*  hush money plot to save his campaign in 2016. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  We now know that same day, federal investigators apparently were interviewing Michigan law [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=55.7s)]
*  enforcement in a sign that there is an active federal investigation into the Michigan fake [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=59.86s)]
*  electors scheme. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=65.22s)]
*  As part of those same court hearings where this news came to light, we also learned that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=67.5s)]
*  the state investigation in Michigan might not have reached its conclusion yet either. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=71.78s)]
*  A state investigator telling the court that the Michigan attorney general's office still [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=75.98s)]
*  has outstanding subpoenas and search warrants as part of what he described as an ongoing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=79.78s)]
*  state investigation into the Michigan fake electors. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=85.14s)]
*  He told the court, quote, it's still an open investigation. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  He also told the court at one point that investigators were treating the Michigan State [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=92.58s)]
*  Republican Party headquarters as a, quote, crime scene. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=96.94s)]
*  Joining us now is Craig Mauger. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=102.02s)]
*  He's politics reporter for the Detroit News. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  He's been reporting on the fake elector news out of Michigan. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=105.38s)]
*  Mr. Mauger, thank you very much for being here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=108.22s)]
*  Appreciate you joining us. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=109.78s)]
*  Hey, thanks so much for having me. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=111.38s)]
*  So this is a sort of sprawling case. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=113.7s)]
*  There's 16 defendants and there's been a lot of court proceedings already, not for [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=116.34s)]
*  all of them, but for most of them that are essentially designed to decide whether or [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=123.06s)]
*  not these charges are going to go ahead. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=128.74s)]
*  It's a long process. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=132.38s)]
*  It's a somewhat complex process given the number of defendants. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=133.86s)]
*  What do you feel like have been the major revelations from the court proceedings that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=137.46s)]
*  you've covered so closely thus far? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=140.1s)]
*  I think you've hit on a couple of them tonight that this is very much an ongoing probe. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=141.9s)]
*  The attorney general staff is trying to figure out what the guidance was that was provided [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=146.38s)]
*  to these 16 electors whose signatures ended up on this certificate, falsely claiming that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=151.34s)]
*  Donald Trump had won Michigan 16 electoral votes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=157.42s)]
*  This investigation is ongoing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=160.94s)]
*  There's some element of a federal probe that's looking at this as well. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=163.1s)]
*  That seems very much ongoing, as you mentioned. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=166.54s)]
*  The key thing here is the attorney general's office has to prove as part of this case to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=169.5s)]
*  be successful that these individuals had an intent to defraud the public. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  The question is, did these individuals have that intent or was someone essentially fooling [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=180.46s)]
*  them into signing this document, not letting them know what the true purpose of the document [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=187.34s)]
*  was and then turning around, taking their signatures and doing something different than [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  what they had told them they were going to do? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=197.66s)]
*  That's the crux of all of this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=199.98s)]
*  And if it's not their intent to defraud, if it's someone else's, the question is, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=201.66s)]
*  whose was that and why have they not been charged so far? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=206.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=209.89999999999998s)]
*  And to have the state prosecutors in Michigan, the investigators, say, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=210.45999999999998s)]
*  we've got these 16 defendants, but here's another 11 people who are unindicted co-conspirators, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=216.29999999999998s)]
*  including the former president, including his top lawyer. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=221.57999999999998s)]
*  It really, they are painting a sprawling picture, but the charges haven't necessarily followed all [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=224.54s)]
*  of the allegations. At this point, Craig, part of the reason I wanted to talk to you is that I was [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  really surprised by this revelation that you reported in court on Friday that there does [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=235.89999999999998s)]
*  appear to be an ongoing federal investigation here, a federal investigation on top of what's [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=240.62s)]
*  going on with the state. Do you have any sense from what's been disclosed in court what the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=245.98s)]
*  contours might be of that federal investigation? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=250.06s)]
*  Well, the police captain who revealed this and everyone in the courtroom was surprised by this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=253.58s)]
*  The defense attorneys were surprised. Even the judge kind of used the word surprise to talk [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=258.22s)]
*  about this statement that was made by the Michigan police captain, all of a sudden kind of out of the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=264.14s)]
*  blue is kind of a traditional line of questioning. Who else have you talked to? And this police [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=268.86s)]
*  captain says, oh, I talked to some people yesterday from Washington, D.C. Everyone kind of froze for a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=273.66s)]
*  second. What do you mean you talked to someone from Washington, D.C. yesterday? He said that this [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=279.02s)]
*  interview focused wholly on the electors. This was about the electors. This wasn't some other issue. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=283.97999999999996s)]
*  This was an interview that lasted some amount of time talking about these fake electoral votes that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=289.41999999999996s)]
*  these people brought to the doorstep of the Michigan Capitol on December 14th, 2020. He said that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=295.97999999999996s)]
*  they didn't ask about specific individuals. He read a list of some names. Did they ask about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=302.29999999999995s)]
*  this person? He said no. It must have been from what I could tell from his testimony, it must have [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=308.85999999999996s)]
*  been kind of overall what happened when you were at the doorstep. These people came to the door. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=314.7s)]
*  You answered. What happened? And it was FBI, FBI personnel and federal prosecutors. And it's now [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=319.26s)]
*  that they're asking him these questions. Wow. It's amazing. It's very important to keep your old tape [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=328.14s)]
*  when you play tape of something that happens. Hold onto it for longer than you hold onto your [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=333.97999999999996s)]
*  tax records because you never know when the FBI will finally follow up on the crime that you aired [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=338.14s)]
*  on your TV show. Craig Mauger, you've really helped us and the whole country follow the nitty gritty of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=343.41999999999996s)]
*  these stories as they've unfolded. And they seem to be unfolding in more and more important ways. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=349.82s)]
*  So we're really grateful for you. Thank you. Thank you for having me. Craig Mauger, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=354.78s)]
*  politics reporter for the Detroit News. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=359.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnvejVIYLOw&t=368.14s)]
