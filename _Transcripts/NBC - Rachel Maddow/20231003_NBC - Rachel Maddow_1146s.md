# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Oct. 2
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk)
*  When former President Donald Trump arrived at the courthouse this morning for the first day of his New York fraud trial, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=0.0s)]
*  he came with his standard list of grievances. He stood outside the courtroom and called the case a witch hunt. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=5.88s)]
*  He called New York's Attorney General a racist for firing suit, filing suit against him. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=10.76s)]
*  He said it's all a big conspiracy hatched by the US Justice Department, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=15.68s)]
*  which has no role whatsoever in this New York state case. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=20.44s)]
*  In this case, what was telling, perhaps most telling, about Mr. Trump's courthouse rant this morning [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=24.919999999999998s)]
*  was the very first thing out of his mouth when he arrived. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=30.68s)]
*  The very first thing he complained about was the perceived size of his business. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=33.68s)]
*  He complained that the judge in this case had suggested that Trump is worth less money than Trump says. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=40.2s)]
*  Trump told reporters as soon as he got to court this morning, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=46.68s)]
*  The trial that kicked off today in New York, because it is a civil suit, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=49.56s)]
*  the stakes for Trump would appear to be lower than in the four criminal indictments he's facing in various jurisdictions. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  This civil case could decimate his business, but those criminal indictments could land him in prison. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=70.0s)]
*  And yet, as the New York Times put it today, Trump is essentially treating this civil suit as if it is a fifth indictment. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=75.76s)]
*  As a civil matter, he wasn't required to be there in court today, but he chose to be there, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=83.36s)]
*  sitting at a defense table all day long and then criticizing the New York Attorney General [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=87.36s)]
*  and criticizing the judge who's hearing the case when he passed reporters on the way in and out of the courtroom. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  At one point, he did seem to call on other people to join in his attacks on Attorney General Tish James [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=97.68s)]
*  when he said, quote, You ought to go after this attorney general. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=103.92s)]
*  Seems like a red flag. It's not like this is the first major civil suit that Trump has faced. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=108.4s)]
*  He never showed up in person for the civil case against him from writer E. Jean Carroll. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=114.72s)]
*  That was a case in which she accused him of sexual assault and rape. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  The jury ultimately found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll, but Trump never bothered to show up during that trial. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=122.84s)]
*  He cared enough to show up today, presumably because this case is about a thing that is famously more important to him than anything else, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=131.44s)]
*  which is how big people think his business is, how rich people think he is. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  The judge in this case has already determined that Trump did fraudulently inflate his assets to make his net worth appear larger than it is. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=145.76s)]
*  The trial that started today is just to determine what punishments the judge is going to impose. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=153.6s)]
*  And those punishments could include barring Trump from ever again operating a business in New York. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=158.16s)]
*  Joining us now is MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin, who was in the courtroom today. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=163.64s)]
*  Lisa, I feel like you need a little bit of like augmented pay for having suffered through this all day, but we're really glad you did. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  And it's nice to see you tonight. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=173.68s)]
*  Good to see you too, Rachel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=174.92s)]
*  So one thing I do not understand is that this is a civil case, but it is not just about against business entities which could have their business certificates canceled. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=176.92s)]
*  Those entities could be put into receivership or liquidated or somehow forfeited in terms of their assets. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  What does it mean to have individual people, persons identified as defendants in a civil case? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=191.56s)]
*  What are Donald Trump, his adult sons, the senior executives from his company personally facing by being named defendants in this case? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=197.88s)]
*  Well, one of the things that they're personally facing are a number of bans or bars on their ability to do business in the state of New York. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=205.28s)]
*  And that would include anything from serving as an officer or director or in the case of Alan Weisselberg, the former CFO and Jeff McConney, the current controller, being financial control people of companies. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=212.84s)]
*  The other thing that Donald Trump himself could face here, Rachel, is disgorgement, which is a fancy way of saying clawing back all the profits and he and his business entities got through this persistent fraud that the attorney general has laid out through her 200 plus page complaint last fall and intends to further prove here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=224.16s)]
*  At trial. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=242.84s)]
*  And that's money that they would take from the assets of the business entities involved, or that's something that the individual people named as defendants would be personally responsible for. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=244.32s)]
*  You know, it's not clear to me that all of the individual defendants are people from whom they could seek disgorgement. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=253.6s)]
*  But the short answer to your question is yes, they could seek it likely from Donald Trump himself, and they could seek it from the business entities. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=258.64s)]
*  And indeed, one of the reasons that Donald Trump fears the dissolution of his companies through this action is that it's not clear how liquid he is and how much money he has in cash to satisfy the judgment that the attorney general is seeking here of at least 250 million. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=265.44s)]
*  Lisa, there was a lot of discussion today, I think, started mostly by President Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, and then also Trump himself commenting on the same matter about the fact that this case is being heard not before a jury, but before just the judge. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=282.23999999999995s)]
*  And there was a lot of discussion about that today, essentially saying that President Trump and his legal team made a mistake that if they had in fact wanted a jury, which is what Trump was complaining about today, that they could have been able to get a legal [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=299.4s)]
*  trial, that they could have very easily gotten a jury instead of ending up just before a judge if they had only sent in the correct form. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=308.36s)]
*  And a lot of people were kind of dunking on them today saying they screwed that up just as a matter of basic paperwork. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  I gather from talking to you about this today a little bit that it isn't quite that simple. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=323.6s)]
*  Could you explain how you see that as having gone? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=329.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, they didn't. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  They're right to say that they didn't request a jury trial, and neither, for that matter, did the attorney general. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  But had they requested a jury trial, it's not clear that they could have gotten one, because the relief that the attorney general is seeking here isn't the kind of relief that a jury can award. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=339.24s)]
*  It's what's called equitable relief. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  And all of these bans and bars on the Trumps doing business here in New York, as well as the disgorgement, which is the clawing back of profits rather than the awarding of damages, that's only for a judge [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=351.04s)]
*  to award. So, yes, they could have tried and maybe the judge would have even bifurcated the trial, allowing them a jury on liability and then just to him alone on the equitable portion. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=362.12s)]
*  But as everyone noted today, they didn't try. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=371.64s)]
*  And if you don't ask, you don't get. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=374.56s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin, thank you so much. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=377.48s)]
*  I know this is going to be a bear to cover as this stretches out likely into some sort of two or three month trial schedule. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=380.92s)]
*  Appreciate you being there for us, Lisa. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=387.04s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=388.76s)]
*  As much as I have found it frustrating for years, there is still even now, unbelievably, a lot of lazy punditry, a lot of lazy assuming out there in the press that our two major parties in this country are basically the same, that there are mirror images of each other. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=389.2s)]
*  The actual news from the actual world is here to disprove that most days, particularly today, though. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=408.76s)]
*  I mean, today, you know, Congress just narrowly averted a government shutdown this weekend, right? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=416.12s)]
*  Today, Congress was consumed with drama over whether the farthest right faction in the Republican Party will be successful in their efforts to oust the Republican speaker of the House. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=423.4s)]
*  Why do they want to oust him a speaker of the House? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=435.56s)]
*  Because he had the temerity to work with Democrats on a bill that kept the government from shutting down. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=438.0s)]
*  That is kind of their sum total of their argument against him. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=444.96s)]
*  I mean, for them, it is self-evident that that that grave crime is enough. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=449.52s)]
*  If House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is going to commit the mortal sin of working with the Democrats on anything, then obviously he must lose his trust in the House. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=453.72s)]
*  And that is, I mean, that's what today was consumed with in Congress. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  That is now what Congress is going to be about for at least the rest of this week and maybe longer. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=464.8s)]
*  Congressman Matt Gaetz, Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, tonight actually filed his motion to vacate, which means within two legislative days, members of the House will have to take up the future of McCarthy's speakership. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=470.68s)]
*  Thanks to Gaetz's objection to the House. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=482.44s)]
*  And nobody knows exactly whether this is going to work, whether Democrats are going to help Kevin McCarthy stay in power. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=485.44s)]
*  What they might demand is their price if they choose to do that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=493.44s)]
*  We also don't know how Republicans will line up for and against Kevin McCarthy. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=497.44s)]
*  Fox News is now reporting that some Republicans who have been in office for a long time, have been in office for a long time. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=501.44s)]
*  And they are not going to be able to do that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=506.44s)]
*  We also don't know how Republicans will line up for and against Kevin McCarthy. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=508.44s)]
*  Fox News is now reporting that some Republicans who like Kevin McCarthy might try to end run this whole thing by trying to expel Matt Gaetz from Congress altogether. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=512.44s)]
*  That should make for some happy, happy fun times. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=521.44s)]
*  But bottom line, whether or not Republicans succeed in ousting their own speaker of the House over this narrow miss on a government shutdown, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=523.44s)]
*  whether or not it ultimately ousts him from the speakership, the message here is clear, right? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=535.44s)]
*  I mean, in the Republican Party, if you work with Democrats on anything, you are in big trouble as a Republican. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=541.44s)]
*  That is where the Republican Party is at right now. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=550.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, here's how the Democratic president is campaigning for reelection. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=554.44s)]
*  There was a time in America when we expected leaders to put people over politics, when instead of shouting, people from different parties talked and listened. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=562.44s)]
*  But for Joe Biden, compromise is in a way of the past. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=575.44s)]
*  It's how he's building America's future, passing hundreds of bipartisan laws, a law to rebuild our roads and bridges that puts Americans to work. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=579.44s)]
*  To make America a leader in high tech manufacturing, bringing good jobs home, laws to improve veterans health care and strengthen gun safety. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=589.44s)]
*  Every one of those laws bipartisan. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=598.44s)]
*  He hasn't gotten everything he wants, but that's not how he measures success. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=601.44s)]
*  For Joe Biden, success means lifting everyone in America, no matter where you live or who you voted for, because he is a president for all Americans. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=606.44s)]
*  I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=617.44s)]
*  He hasn't gotten everything he wanted, but that's not how he defines success. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=622.44s)]
*  Now for for for true blue liberals and and real Democratic partisans who are watching that ad, you may object to that strategy. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=628.44s)]
*  Right. And some of that imagery in particular can be hard to swallow. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=635.44s)]
*  You know, Condoleezza Rice and Reagan and even John McCain. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=639.44s)]
*  Right. But that's Joe Biden. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=642.44s)]
*  Right. President Biden has always been a very collegial guy, both with his Democratic colleagues and also with Republicans. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=645.44s)]
*  It is a core part of how he works as a politician and therefore of what people expect from him in politics. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=652.44s)]
*  Yes, he is a liberal. Yes, he is a progressive on almost all policy issues, but he will work with everyone. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=659.44s)]
*  He'll always try to find middle ground. That's Joe Biden. He has been doing this literally for decades. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=665.44s)]
*  It is not a surprise that this is how he works and this is now how he is campaigning for reelection. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=670.44s)]
*  Democrats are campaigning for office by saying all compromise and find middle ground. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=675.44s)]
*  Republicans are run out of their party for even thinking about that, let alone doing it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=680.44s)]
*  There there is no way to both sides this. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=687.44s)]
*  There is no mirror image here. One of these things is not like the other. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=691.44s)]
*  The two parties are working on two different projects. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=695.44s)]
*  And the reasons for that are myriad. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=700.44s)]
*  But here's another piece of it that we are just learning. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=704.44s)]
*  NBC News has just broken a new story tonight, a very provocative story within the last hour that may give us a little bit of a window into why the two sides, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=709.44s)]
*  the two major political parties in the United States right now seem like they are coming from two different planets and they are trying to do two totally different things. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=719.44s)]
*  It may have a little bit to do with the relationship between the fringe, the extreme and the middle. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=728.44s)]
*  The distance between the, you know, not just not governing, but really far out there, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=737.44s)]
*  sort of non respectable fringe and the actual governing part of the party. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=745.44s)]
*  Here's a story about 25 years ago, 1997, the flagship conservative magazine, the National Review went through one of its periodic purges. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=751.44s)]
*  They realized, as they periodically do, that they were employing some writers. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=762.44s)]
*  They were publishing some pieces that were just too racist. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=767.44s)]
*  They have periodically realized this over the course of the history of this magazine. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=771.44s)]
*  They have to do this when they have ended up publishing people who claimed that, you know, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=775.44s)]
*  white people are naturally more intelligent than everybody else, that white people are genetically superior to all other races. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=779.44s)]
*  They were publishing a guy who argued that white parents and Asian parents should teach their children to avoid black people. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=786.44s)]
*  They published a guy who argued that America was in the midst of a genocide of white people because of nonwhite immigrants coming into America. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=792.44s)]
*  The National Review periodically has had to do these kinds of purges, but the one they did in 1997 resulted in a new home being founded effectively for people like that who the National Review has to fire. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=799.44s)]
*  In 1999, an organization was set up called V-Dare. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=813.44s)]
*  And V-Dare, they say, stands for the name Virginia Dare, who they say was supposedly the first white child born in colonial America. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=818.44s)]
*  You can see where this is going, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=830.44s)]
*  The founder of V-Dare, one of these guys who got fired from the National Review for his whites-only immigration stuff, he founded V-Dare, basically set it up as an online hub for people to advance academic-sounding and political-sounding racism. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=832.44s)]
*  And I don't mean that in a vague kind of way. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=846.44s)]
*  I mean it really specifically. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=848.44s)]
*  The founder of V-Dare calls himself a racial nationalist. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=849.44s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=853.44s)]
*  It means in this nation, it should just be the one race. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=854.44s)]
*  He said the Obama administration was a minority occupation government, meaning it was not an American government, but it was a minority occupation by some foreign entity. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=858.44s)]
*  He also says, and forgive me for even quoting this, but he says that Hispanics, quote, specialize in rape. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=870.44s)]
*  He says the United States, quote, is a white nation. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=877.44s)]
*  So this is stuff that's like off the edge, right? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=882.44s)]
*  Or at least, at least it used to be. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=887.44s)]
*  In 2018, CNN reported that a speechwriter in the Trump White House had spoken at a white nationalist conference and done a panel with the founder of V-Dare just a few days before Election Day in 2016. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=889.44s)]
*  And when that news came out in CNN, that speechwriter was fired from the Trump White House. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=907.44s)]
*  But these guys have to land somewhere, right? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=913.44s)]
*  Turns out that guy who went straight from appearing with the V-Dare guy at the white nationalist event the week of the 2016 election, he went straight from there to a job working in the Trump White House as a speechwriter thereafter. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=916.44s)]
*  When he was fired from even the Trump White House, he first briefly landed a new speechwriter job with Congressman Matt Gaetz, who just tonight has filed this motion to vacate, to remove Republican Speaker of the House, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=929.44s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy, from his job for the capital crime of working with Democrats to keep the government open. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=945.44s)]
*  So this guy fired from the Trump White House briefly lands as a speechwriter with Matt Gaetz. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=952.44s)]
*  Then he lands at a website, a right wing website that, among other things, pushes the conspiracy theory that there wasn't really an attack on the U.S. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=957.44s)]
*  Capitol by a Trump supporting mob on January 6, 2021. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=966.44s)]
*  That was actually an FBI operation with FBI agents and informants and operators just pretending to be Trump supporters because deep state, flat earth, QAnon, whatever. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=970.44s)]
*  Well, now NBC News reports just within the last hour that it is that guy's far right website that appears to have published the blueprint for right wing billionaire Elon Musk to buy the social media platform formerly known as Twitter to take it private and then to basically kill it off as a means of helping the far right and hurting the United States of America. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=987.44s)]
*  The article called it a quote declaration of war against the globalist American empire. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1015.44s)]
*  So that's how things are going on the right. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1025.44s)]
*  In the Democratic Party, its former president, Jimmy Carter, in hospice turning 99, he may yet eradicate Guinea worm infection from the face of the earth before he goes as part of his legacy of good works and practical post post presidency. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1028.44s)]
*  Decency and leadership. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1045.44s)]
*  We've got the current Democratic president running for reelection by showcasing how much he wants to work with Democrats and Republicans and how much it's OK to compromise and not get everything you want as long as you bring people together. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1046.44s)]
*  And he's committed to that. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1058.44s)]
*  On the right, it's a what's the phrase a declaration of war against the globalist American empire. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1062.44s)]
*  Shaping the media landscape in America and a former president indicted on 91 felonies and spending his days now trying to sick his supporters on the judges and prosecutors who are confronting him in court. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1070.44s)]
*  Both sides ism about our two major political parties has really never been warranted in this country in modern times, not in my lifetime. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1088.44s)]
*  Right now, it is not just unwarranted. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1097.44s)]
*  It is malpractice. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1099.44s)]
*  One of these things is not at all like the other. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsvVojFc-Kk&t=1101.44s)]
