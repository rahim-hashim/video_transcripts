# Senior FBI counterintel official charged for work helping Russian oligarch Deripaska
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I)
*  The other big national security story we're following tonight is an absolutely shocking arrest and indictment of a senior FBI counter intelligence official. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, this story is legitimately shocking. Do you remember the name Oleg Deripaska from the Mueller investigation from all the Mishigas around Paul Manafort, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=12.0s)]
*  the now convicted felon who served as campaign chairman for the Trump campaign in 2016? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=23.0s)]
*  The name Oleg Deripaska is, you know, it's a Russian name. It can just sometimes if you're not as familiar with a lot of different Russian names, it can be hard to remember these things. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=28.0s)]
*  I feel like he is one of the more memorable ones, if only because we heard his name so many times amid the whole Russia scandal. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=38.0s)]
*  When we learned in the lead up to the 2016 election that Russia was messing with our election to try to help Trump get elected. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=46.0s)]
*  I mean, one of the single most bananas revelations of that whole time period, it was more bananas than that photo of Trump's national security adviser sitting at a table with Putin in Russia at an event for which a Russian propaganda agency paid him thousands of dollars to be there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=54.0s)]
*  It was more bananas than the revelation that even though Trump said he had no business dealings in Russia on the night of the third Republican presidential candidates debate, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=70.0s)]
*  Trump secretly signed a letter of intent to build the biggest real estate project of his life in Moscow. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=79.0s)]
*  The revelation about Oleg Deripaska was more bananas than all of that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=85.0s)]
*  For me, in terms of like revelatory moments in the middle of that scandal, this still sticks out to me as the one that was the most astonishing thing to learn in the moment that I learned it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=90.0s)]
*  It was March 2017, an Associated Press report. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=102.0s)]
*  So this is a public report after we had already learned in 2016 that Russia had intervened in our election in every way they could to try to get Trump into the White House. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=106.0s)]
*  In March 2017, this AP report crossed the wires saying that Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, had been paid on a multimillion dollar annual multi-year contract to promote the interests of the Putin government in the United States and around the world. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=115.0s)]
*  I mean, the guy running the Trump campaign while Russia's trying to get him elected, that guy is on a multimillion dollar annual contract to promote Putin's interest. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=138.0s)]
*  How is this? Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=149.0s)]
*  The man reportedly paying Manafort to promote the Kremlin's interests in the United States was an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin named Oleg Deripaska. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=151.0s)]
*  Oleg Deripaska and Paul Manafort were in business together in various ways for years and years and years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=161.0s)]
*  Oleg Deripaska is all over the Mueller report. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=167.0s)]
*  His name appears in the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report on what Russia did in the 2016 election. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=170.0s)]
*  Deripaska's name is in that report more than 300 times. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=176.0s)]
*  Oleg Deripaska ended up getting sanctioned by the US government for his key role in Russia's efforts to mess with the 2016 US election. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=181.0s)]
*  That's Oleg Deripaska. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=192.0s)]
*  And now look at tonight's headline, The New York Times. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=195.0s)]
*  Former top FBI official in New York charged with aiding oligarch. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=198.0s)]
*  Prosecutors say Charles McGonigal, who is chief of counterintelligence in New York City, worked secretly for Oleg Deripaska. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=202.0s)]
*  We've got a picture on the front page of The New York Times of Oleg Deripaska. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=211.0s)]
*  Again, he's back. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=215.0s)]
*  For the craziest of all possible reasons. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=217.0s)]
*  I mean, here's the headline in The Washington Post tonight. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=220.0s)]
*  Former senior FBI official accused of working for Russian. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=222.0s)]
*  He investigated. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=227.0s)]
*  Charles McGonigal, former counterintelligence chief, is charged with money laundering and other counts connected to oligarch Oleg Deripaska. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=230.0s)]
*  McGonigal was a senior counterintelligence official at FBI headquarters until late 2016. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=239.0s)]
*  Just before the 2016 election in October 2016. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=245.0s)]
*  They moved him from FBI headquarters to the New York field office to be the special agent in charge of counterintelligence there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=249.0s)]
*  McGonigal was arrested this weekend at JFK Airport in New York. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=257.0s)]
*  They indicted him today in D.C. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=261.0s)]
*  For taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from an Albanian intelligence officer while he was on the job at FBI headquarters in D.C. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=265.0s)]
*  They also indicted him in New York where he's charged with being on Oleg Deripaska's payroll and also with taking steps to hide it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=273.0s)]
*  Because, of course, Deripaska is sanctioned by the U.S. government. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=280.0s)]
*  So nobody in the United States should be in business with him anymore. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=283.0s)]
*  Charles McGonigal retired from the FBI after 22 years in 2018. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=287.0s)]
*  2018 is the same year Deripaska was sanctioned by the U.S. government. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=292.0s)]
*  McGonigal is charged with being on Deripaska's payroll. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=295.0s)]
*  Basically through a law firm starting in 2019 and then eventually getting paid by Deripaska directly starting in 2021. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=299.0s)]
*  Deripaska was criminally charged with evading sanctions last year. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=306.0s)]
*  The FBI raided two homes associated with Deripaska, both in New York and D.C. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=312.0s)]
*  But I mean, what of that investigation now? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=319.0s)]
*  Because now this special agent in charge, the senior FBI official who supervised and participated in investigations of Russian oligarchs, including Deripaska, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=322.0s)]
*  now he is charged with secretly working for that same guy and secretly taking money from him. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=332.0s)]
*  As the Times notes tonight, this shows, among other things, that the reach of Russia's oligarchs can extend even into the heart of U.S. law enforcement. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=340.0s)]
*  These revelations and these indictments also raise huge questions about the incredibly sensitive counterintelligence information that this FBI official had access to. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=351.0s)]
*  I mean, he was a very senior counterintelligence official. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=363.0s)]
*  Among other things, he was reportedly the lead FBI investigator looking into why it was that U.S. intelligence assets were getting arrested and murdered in China all of a sudden. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=366.0s)]
*  I mean, these are people who were losing their lives to work with our country. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=377.0s)]
*  The guy charged with investigating how it was that they were being exposed and how it was that they were starting to get murdered. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=383.0s)]
*  He himself was allegedly being paid by foreign governments and spies. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=389.0s)]
*  I only know what I read in the spy books and what I read in the indictments, but from a national security perspective, this seems very bad. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=396.0s)]
*  It also just seems very, very unusual. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W790tGfxy1I&t=404.0s)]
