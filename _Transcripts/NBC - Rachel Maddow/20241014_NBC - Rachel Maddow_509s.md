# Rachel Maddow calls the bluff of Trump supporters who claim to be making a 'business decision'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ)
*  I have a question for business people or for business-minded people or even just for people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=0.0s)]
*  who say that business issues and economic issues are their main concern. That's what's driving [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=6.88s)]
*  them as they think about this election. And, you know, I feel like even for those of us who [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=12.16s)]
*  don't think of ourselves as business-minded people or as business people or people for [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=18.8s)]
*  whom that's our top priority, a lot of us have a lot of respect for people who do define themselves [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  that way, right? You think that's sort of kind of a serious way to look at the world, a respectable [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=26.4s)]
*  way to look at the world. Maybe business issues aren't my top thing, maybe economic issues aren't [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=30.88s)]
*  my top thing, I don't know. But if those are top concerns for you, well, credit to you. I'm interested [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=35.76s)]
*  in how you make your decisions on that basis, right? It's a respectable approach to these kinds [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=41.28s)]
*  of difficult questions. And this issue about sort of making a business decision about your vote, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=45.28s)]
*  a business decision about the election, this comes up all the time when you look at real-world [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=51.36s)]
*  support for Donald Trump, right? When you look at why, you know, relatively normal people say [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=56.24s)]
*  they're going to vote for him. Yes, yes, he tried to stay in power by sickening a violent mob on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=61.04s)]
*  Congress after he lost reelection. Yes, he's awaiting sentencing after being convicted of 34 [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=66.08s)]
*  felonies. Yes, he's awaiting trial on dozens more felony charges. Yes, he told Americans they could [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=71.2s)]
*  inject disinfectant for COVID. Yes, he made it government policy to take little kids away from [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=76.48s)]
*  their moms and dads. Yes, he gave pardons to all his friends and he got impeached twice. And now he [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=81.84s)]
*  is running for reelection by talking about people with bad genes poisoning the blood of America [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=87.28s)]
*  and how we're going to use the military to build gigantic camps and we're going to round up tens of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  millions of people in America and put them in these huge camps. Yes, yes, there are things about him [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=97.36s)]
*  that maybe aren't appealing. There are things about him that maybe sound a little nutty. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=102.88s)]
*  But you hear this all the time, but, you know, but his policies. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=107.76s)]
*  If you're just an economic minded person, if you're just a business minded person, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  then you're sort of big enough or sort of above it all enough to not really care about or not [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=119.36s)]
*  even really think about stuff like that. You're just in it for the policies. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=125.04s)]
*  Like Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said just last week, this is the same Brian Kemp that Trump tried [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=131.68s)]
*  to force to throw out the election results from his state last time. Kemp said he's voting for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=137.04s)]
*  Trump this time anyway. He just said last week, quote, Look, you may not like Donald Trump [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=142.79999999999998s)]
*  personally, but you'll like his policies. It's a business decision. You're making a business decision. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=147.44s)]
*  That's mostly what I want to talk about tonight. Tell me what is a business decision in this case? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=155.92s)]
*  I mean, is it who will do a better job handling the economy? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=162.0s)]
*  Because as we come to the end of the Biden-Harris administration now, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  I mean, here's the special report that's just put out today by The Economist magazine. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  The title is, quote, The American economy, the envy of the world. This is a multi-day [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=178.72s)]
*  special report that's coming out now from The Economist. Here's the first installment in this [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=184.8s)]
*  multi-part series that's just out today. Quote, The American economy has left other rich countries [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=190.4s)]
*  in the dust. That's the American economy at the end of the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=195.84s)]
*  I mean, if you're making a business decision about who will do a better job handling the economy, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=202.96s)]
*  well, the Biden-Harris economy has not only left every other rich country in the world in the dust, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=207.84s)]
*  it has left the record of the Trump administration in the dust. Right? Literally, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=213.76s)]
*  what they're calling a dream economy, the best job market in the history of the United States. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=218.8s)]
*  That's what Biden, the Biden-Harris administration has done in their management of the U.S. economy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  So is that what you're basing your business decision on? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  Maybe it's not the broad question of who will do a good job with the economy, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=236.96s)]
*  who's shown that they can do a good job with the economy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  Maybe your business decision when it comes to this election is more specific. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=243.28s)]
*  Maybe it's about the deficit. Maybe you're a fiscal hawk, and that's the basis of your [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=248.88000000000002s)]
*  business decision that you're making about who to support here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=253.84s)]
*  Well, here's the headline today at The Wall Street Journal. Quote, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  Economists say inflation and deficits will be higher under Trump than Harris. Quote, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=260.56s)]
*  According to a quarterly survey by The Wall Street Journal, most economists think inflation, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=265.92s)]
*  interest rates and deficits would be higher under the policies former President Donald Trump would [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=271.44s)]
*  pursue in a second administration than under those proposed by Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=276.8s)]
*  Quote, 65 percent of economists see Trump's proposed policies putting more upward pressure [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=282.16s)]
*  on the federal deficit than Kamala Harris's policies. The Committee for a Responsible [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  Federal Budget estimates Trump's plans would widen federal budget deficits by more than twice [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=293.92s)]
*  the expected increase under Harris. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=300.24s)]
*  So if that's the basis for your business decision about this election, if all you say you care about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  is fiscal responsibility and the deficit, right, bringing that deficit down. Well, Trump doubles [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=310.23999999999995s)]
*  Harris. He laps Harris in terms of what he's planning to pile on to the deficit. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  Right? Similarly, let's say your business decision on this election is on inflation. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's also a business decision about this election that should point you in one direction. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=328.8s)]
*  Quote, of the economists who responded to The Wall Street Journal's question on inflation, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=334.0s)]
*  68 percent said prices would rise faster under Trump than under Harris. 68 percent of economists [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=338.8s)]
*  don't agree that today is Monday or that the patriots suck this year. But 68 percent of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=346.48s)]
*  economists agree that Trump is proposing really bad policies if what you care about is inflation. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=351.28s)]
*  So what are you basing your business decision on when thinking about this election? I mean, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  maybe your business decision is less about data and policy and it's more about just the kind of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=365.11999999999995s)]
*  person you want the candidate to be. You hear this all the time from people who describe themselves [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=371.28s)]
*  as making a business decision about how to vote. They say they want somebody centrist, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=376.64s)]
*  somebody moderate, sensible, right, somebody right in the middle. That's good for business. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  Somebody who can appeal to reasonable people in both parties. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=386.0s)]
*  If that's your approach to your business decision about this election, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=392.56s)]
*  well, there is a candidate in this election who has a lot of very high-profile support from [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=397.28s)]
*  people in the other party. Just today, the Harris campaign released the latest ad from another [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=402.0s)]
*  Republican endorsing Harris, in this case, the Republican mayor of an important conservative [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=408.56s)]
*  city in swing state Arizona. I mean, there's like a campaign trail tour group now of former [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=413.44s)]
*  Trump administration officials who are doing swing state events to tell people to not vote for the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=420.4s)]
*  man they served under in the last presidential administration under Trump. They are instead [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=426.08s)]
*  touring the swing states telling people to vote for Kamala Harris. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=430.88s)]
*  Notice that there's no equivalent without on the other side. There's no group that's like [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=433.76s)]
*  former Biden officials for Trump or former Obama officials for Trump. There's nothing like that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=437.44s)]
*  But there are lots and lots of officials from former Republican administrations and from [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=443.6s)]
*  Trump's own administration who are publicly begging Americans by the dozens, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=448.8s)]
*  the thousands, publicly begging Americans to vote for Harris and not for him. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=455.12s)]
*  So just, I mean, just on the facts. I mean, if your business decision is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=462.8s)]
*  economic performance broadly, that breaks for Harris. If your business decision is the deficit, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=468.16s)]
*  that breaks for Harris. If your business decision is inflation, that breaks for Harris. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=474.88s)]
*  If your business decision is on whether the candidate is bipartisan-seeming and can appeal [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=480.0s)]
*  across both parties, clearly that's Harris. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce3NynoFYSQ&t=484.8s)]
