# Maddow: For a supposed populist, Trump is strangely attached to unpopular ideas
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y)
*  Special message for everybody in the media and political commentary who keeps calling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump a populist. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=4.88s)]
*  When you are a baby girl that is 11 years old, you do not need 30 dolls. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=7.24s)]
*  President Donald J. Trump, quote, I don't think that a beautiful baby girl needs, that's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=15.1s)]
*  11 years old, needs to have 30 dolls. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=19.36s)]
*  I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=23.02s)]
*  was just unbelievable. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  We had a trade deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars with China. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=28.7s)]
*  President telling NBC News, quote, I'm just saying they don't need to have 30 dolls. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=33.379999999999995s)]
*  They can have three. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=37.48s)]
*  They don't need to have 250 pencils. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  They can have five. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=40.86s)]
*  Three dolls, five pencils. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=43.9s)]
*  And you'd be grateful if you get that American child. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=46.86s)]
*  Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One yesterday, quote, all I'm saying is that a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=52.14s)]
*  young lady, a 10-year-old girl, 9-year-old girl, 15-year-old girl doesn't need 37 dolls. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=56.12s)]
*  She could be very happy with two or three or four or five. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=64.86s)]
*  So now that is how many dolls, two or three or four or five. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=68.22s)]
*  Who gets five dolls when some people only get two dolls? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=71.38s)]
*  President has recently mused publicly that he does not care if the price of cars goes [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  up. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=80.8s)]
*  He does not care if we have a recession. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=81.8s)]
*  He does not care if small businesses want relief from the tariffs. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=83.34s)]
*  He does not care if strollers cost more. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=86.64s)]
*  He called them the thing you put the baby in. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=90.26s)]
*  But there's more to being president than not worrying about the price of cars or causing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=94.2s)]
*  a recession or even setting important policy on dolls and pencils. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=97.62s)]
*  At the top of his supposedly populist agenda this week, as of today, President Donald Trump [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=102.16s)]
*  is sickening collection agencies on Americans whose student loans aren't paid up to date. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=107.46s)]
*  This is a change from the policies of President Biden. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=113.94s)]
*  The Trump administration, as of today, has sent out the first notices that the Treasury [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=115.94s)]
*  is going to start taking away tax refunds and then siphoning your wages if you do not [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  pay up on student loans. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=126.78s)]
*  Five million Americans are in default on their student loans already. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=128.74s)]
*  Millions more Americans are on the verge of default on their student loans. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=132.64s)]
*  And now Trump is handing these millions of Americans over to the tender administrations [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=136.1s)]
*  of collections agencies. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=141.34s)]
*  Ever had a collections agency come after you? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=143.22s)]
*  Remind me please what populism is. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=147.7s)]
*  Somehow three dolls, five pencils and a pounding on the door from the collection agency is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=151.34s)]
*  not how I imagined it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7z2K-nyY3Y&t=155.14s)]
