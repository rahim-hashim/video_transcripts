# Garland Memo Doubles Down On Barr Policy On Investigating Candidates
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y)
*  This is a document that we have just obtained that has not been published elsewhere. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  It is from Attorney General Merrick Garland. It is addressed to all Justice Department employees. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=3.68s)]
*  It is dated May 25, 2022. So that's about eight weeks ago. But again, we believe the first time [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  this document has been shown to the public. As you can see, it is titled, Election Year Sensitivities. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=15.44s)]
*  Department of Justice employees are entrusted with the authority to enforce the laws of the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=22.72s)]
*  United States and with the responsibility to do so in a neutral and impartial manner. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=26.639999999999997s)]
*  This is particularly important in an election year now that the 2022 election season is upon us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=31.04s)]
*  And as in prior election cycles, I am issuing this memorandum to remind you of the department's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=36.48s)]
*  existing policies with respect to political activities. And again, this is a memo that is [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=41.44s)]
*  from Attorney General Merrick Garland. It has his signature on the top of it in blue ink. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=46.0s)]
*  And then it says this under the heading, Statements, Investigations and Charging [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=52.08s)]
*  Near an Election. Quote, the Department of Justice has a strong interest in the prosecution [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=55.84s)]
*  of election related crimes, such as those involving federal and state campaign finance laws, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=60.24s)]
*  federal patronage laws, corruption of the election process. As department employees, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=64.4s)]
*  however, we must be particularly sensitive to safeguarding the department's reputation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=69.04s)]
*  for fairness, neutrality and nonpartisanship. Simply put, partisan politics must play no role [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=73.04s)]
*  in the decisions of federal investigators or prosecutors regarding any investigations or [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  criminal charges. Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of public [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=83.6s)]
*  statements, attributed or not, meaning on background or not. Investigative steps, criminal [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  charges or any other action in any matter or case for the purpose of affecting any election [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=94.8s)]
*  or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Such a purpose or the appearance of such a purpose is inconsistent with the department's mission [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=104.16s)]
*  and with the principles of federal prosecution. If you face an issue or the appearance of an issue [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=108.88s)]
*  regarding the timing of statements, investigative steps, charges or other actions near the time of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=113.36s)]
*  a primary or general election, contact the public integrity section of the criminal division for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=118.64s)]
*  further guidance. Such consultation is also required at various stages of all criminal matters [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=123.52s)]
*  that focus on violations of federal and state campaign finance laws, federal patronage crimes [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=129.2s)]
*  and corruption of the election process. And now get this. Finally, department employees must also [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=133.76s)]
*  adhere to the additional requirements issued by the attorney general on February 5th, 2020. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=141.92s)]
*  February 5th, 2020. Governing the opening of criminal and counterintelligence investigations [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=148.88s)]
*  by the department, including its law enforcement agencies related to politically sensitive [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  individuals and entities. See memorandum of attorney general William Barr, February 5th, 2020. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=158.88s)]
*  Any questions regarding the scope or requirements of the February 2020 attorney [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=166.0s)]
*  general's memorandum should be directed to the public integrity section. Again, this memo from [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=169.92s)]
*  Merrick Garland to the justice department, to all justice department employees was sent out about [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=177.2s)]
*  eight weeks ago in late May. We have just obtained it. We believe this is the first time it's been [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=181.83999999999997s)]
*  made public. And in large part, this memo from the attorney general follows both the letter and the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=185.2s)]
*  spirit of previous letters from other attorneys general around election time. Basically says, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=192.64s)]
*  look, we can't look like we're acting to effectuate some particular partisan outcome around [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=198.96s)]
*  election time. That means we may delay certain steps we would otherwise take in order to avoid [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=205.6s)]
*  even the perception that we are trying to influence election outcomes. We have seen that kind of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=210.72s)]
*  guidance before from attorneys general of all stripes. That's fine. That's at least non-controversial. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=216.24s)]
*  But this last part about Bill Barr's instructions from 2020, that's kind of a surprise. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=220.56s)]
*  February 2020, Trump attorney general Bill Barr put out new guidance over and above what all [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=230.08s)]
*  attorneys general had previously said. And what Bill Barr said in February 2020 was specifically [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=235.2s)]
*  that, in essence, nobody's allowed to investigate anybody connected to a presidential candidate [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=241.44s)]
*  without his permission personally as attorney general. Barr's memo from February 2020, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=247.28s)]
*  the language of it specifically, it said, quote, no investigation, including any preliminary [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=253.92s)]
*  investigation, may be opened or initiated by the department or any of its law enforcement agencies [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=258.32s)]
*  of a declared candidate for president or vice president, a presidential campaign, or a senior [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=263.44s)]
*  presidential campaign staff member or advisor absent prior written approval of the attorney general [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=268.08s)]
*  through the deputy attorney general. Trump attorney general Bill Barr established that new rule [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=274.4s)]
*  in February 2020, no investigating any declared candidate for president or anybody working for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=281.52s)]
*  that candidate unless I personally give my permission. That new rule was established by [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=287.52s)]
*  Bill Barr when he was working for Donald Trump. Merrick Garland has just formally extended that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=293.84s)]
*  guidance and told every employee of the Justice Department that it is still in effect. Notice went [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=300.56s)]
*  out in late May, we are reporting the memo here, making it publicly available for the first time. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=305.76s)]
*  Well, what's happened in the meantime since that guidance went out from Merrick Garland [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=312.16s)]
*  to every Justice Department employee telling them that the Bill Barr advice is still in effect [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=319.2s)]
*  and any investigation, including the opening of any investigation that applies to a candidate for [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=324.08s)]
*  president or anybody working for a candidate for president that has to get his personal sign off. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=329.52s)]
*  What has happened since late May when this went out? Well, former president Donald Trump has had [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  the delightful experience of the January 6 investigation, essentially rolling out a real [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=338.96s)]
*  time prime time criminal referral of him to the Justice Department. Justice Department, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=344.64s)]
*  which is poking along with its own cases at its own pace, may be more interested in the fake [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=351.52s)]
*  electors part specifically, maybe just spending a lot of time watching the January 6 investigators [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=355.76s)]
*  marveling at all the neat stuff they've turned up that the Justice Department is apparently [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=360.96s)]
*  learning about the same time we all are by watching the hearings. That's happened since [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=365.84s)]
*  this memo went out. And also since this memo went out, Trump has responded to all these revelations [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  about him in January 6th by reportedly moving to speed up his own declaration that he's going to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=378.32s)]
*  be a candidate for president again. And that of course is despite the interests of the Republican [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=383.92s)]
*  Party, which will likely not be helped at all by him telling the country formally that he intends [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=388.64000000000004s)]
*  to lead the Republican Party again right before people have to decide this fall whether to put [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=393.68s)]
*  Republicans in power in Congress. It wouldn't be good for the Republican Party if Trump announces [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=397.92s)]
*  he's a candidate for president again before the midterm elections happen. Wouldn't be good for [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=403.04s)]
*  his party, but it would be very much in keeping with his own interest and putting as many roadblocks [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=407.92s)]
*  as possible in the way of any possible prosecution of himself. Jennifer Rubin writing at the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=411.84s)]
*  Washington Post today said, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  The January 6th committee's remarkable success in fact finding and presenting evidence against Trump [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=420.0s)]
*  leaves the Justice Department on the defense and scrambling to staff up. The department now faces [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=424.88s)]
*  the prospect that Trump will announce his presidential run in the fall, which the former [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=429.84s)]
*  president will use to cast any subsequent charges as political efforts to keep him from office. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=433.35999999999996s)]
*  Fair enough. January 6th investigation chairman Benny Thompson was just asked about this tonight. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=438.08s)]
*  Even I don't know even if [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=468.88s)]
*  I look at the law and if a person breaks the law, uh, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=471.76s)]
*  if a person breaks the law or is accused of breaking the law, he's not one who can just do [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=496.8s)]
*  what he chooses because he's running for president. So Donald Trump is just like every other American [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=500.96s)]
*  citizen in this situation. Yes, it would be unorthodox for him to announce two years in [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  advance that he's a candidate for president. Why would he do that? Well, now we know now that we've [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  obtained this Justice Department memo from a few weeks ago. Now we know for sure that it does kick [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=516.4s)]
*  something into action. If he in fact announces himself as a declared candidate for president, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=521.36s)]
*  that means any investigation that relates to him or anyone working for him has to be personally [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=525.76s)]
*  cleared in writing through the very highest echelons of the Justice Department. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMl4C2qIF4Y&t=530.16s)]
