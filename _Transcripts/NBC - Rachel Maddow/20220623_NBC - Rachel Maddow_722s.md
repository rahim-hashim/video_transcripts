# Detailing Crimes May Have Discouraged Trump From Pardons
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0)
*  The idea that Republican members of Congress were worried enough about their criminal exposure [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=0.0s)]
*  that they'd sought pardons in the waning days of the Trump presidency, it's not totally [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=4.2s)]
*  a new idea. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=9.76s)]
*  There had been some press reports to that effect in the immediate aftermath of the January [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=10.76s)]
*  6th attack. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=14.48s)]
*  But then at the first hearing of the January 6th committee a couple of weeks ago, Liz Cheney [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=15.92s)]
*  basically teased that news and said that more on it might be coming. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=20.54s)]
*  At that hearing, she specifically mentioned one obscure Pennsylvania Republican congressman [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=25.2s)]
*  named Scott Perry. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=29.84s)]
*  She mentioned him by name. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=30.88s)]
*  She said he had contacted the White House in the weeks after January 6th to seek a presidential [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=32.2s)]
*  pardon for himself. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=36.76s)]
*  Now Congressman Perry reacted angrily to that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=38.44s)]
*  After Liz Cheney made those remarks at the first hearing, he said the idea that he sought [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=41.84s)]
*  a pardon from President Trump was absolutely not true. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=45.04s)]
*  He told reporters that Cheney's assertion about that was, quote, ludicrous and a soulless [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=48.56s)]
*  lie. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=54.32s)]
*  But it apparently is something that he did, and it was apparently not just him. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=56.84s)]
*  At that first hearing, Cheney said that Perry sought a pardon and that multiple other Republican [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  congressmen had sought pardons in connection with their efforts to keep Trump in power. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=66.7s)]
*  Well, today the committee showed their receipts on that front. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=71.48s)]
*  My colleagues and I up here also take an oath. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=76.60000000000001s)]
*  Some of them failed to uphold theirs and instead chose to spread the big lie. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=80.66s)]
*  Days after the tragic events of January 6th, some of these same Republican members requested [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=88.14s)]
*  pardons in the waning days of the Trump administration. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=94.06s)]
*  Five days after the attack on the Capitol, Representative Mo Brooks sent the email on [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=100.5s)]
*  the screen now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=105.06s)]
*  As you see, he emailed the White House, quote, pursuant to a request from Matt Gaetz, requesting [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=107.72s)]
*  a pardon for Representative Gaetz himself and unnamed others. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=113.02s)]
*  Witnesses told the select committee that the president considered offering pardons to a [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=118.92s)]
*  wide range of individuals connected to the president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=122.92s)]
*  Let's listen to some of that testimony. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=127.32s)]
*  The president was Representative Gaetz requesting a pardon? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=132.08s)]
*  Believe so. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  The general tone was we may get prosecuted because we were defensive of the president's [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  positions on these things. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=147.44s)]
*  The pardon that he was discussing, requesting, was as broad as you could describe. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=150.4s)]
*  From the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=159.28s)]
*  He mentioned Nixon and I said Nixon's pardon was never nearly that broad. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=164.72s)]
*  Are you aware of any members' democracy pardons? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=169.68s)]
*  Mr. Gaetz and Mr. Brooks, I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon for members [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=175.68s)]
*  involved in that meeting and a handful of other members that weren't at the December [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  21st meeting as the preemptive pardons. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=189.68s)]
*  Mr. Gaetz was personally pushing for a pardon and he was doing so since early December. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure why. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Gaetz reached out to me to ask if he could have a meeting with Mr. Meadows about receiving [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=204.08s)]
*  a presidential pardon. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=209.36s)]
*  Did they all have that meeting? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=210.56s)]
*  Not all of them, but several of them did. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=212.56s)]
*  Mr. Gaetz, Mr. Brooks? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=214.56s)]
*  Mr. Fakes did. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=216.56s)]
*  Mr. Dorn talked about congressional pardons, but he never asked me for one. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=220.56s)]
*  It was more for an update on whether the White House is going to pardon members of Congress. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=226.56s)]
*  Mr. Gohmert asked for one as well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=232.56s)]
*  Mr. Perry asked for a pardon too. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=238.56s)]
*  Did he talk to you directly? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=240.56s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=244.56s)]
*  Did Marjorie Green contact you? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=246.56s)]
*  No, she didn't contact me about it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=248.56s)]
*  I heard that she had asked the White House Counsel Office for a pardon from Mr. Philbin, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=250.56s)]
*  but I didn't frequently get this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=256.56s)]
*  Are you aware of any conversations or communications regarding the possibility of giving Congressman Matt Gaetz a pardon? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=264.56s)]
*  I know he had asked for it, but I don't know if he ever received one or what happened with it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=274.56s)]
*  How do you know that Congressman Gaetz asked for a pardon? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=280.56s)]
*  He told me. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=284.56s)]
*  Tell us about that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=286.56s)]
*  He told me he had asked Meadows for a pardon. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=288.56s)]
*  Were you involved in or did you witness any conversations about the possibility of a blanket pardon for everyone involved in January 6th? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=290.56s)]
*  I heard that mentioned. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=300.56s)]
*  Do you know whether the President had any conversations about potentially pardoning any family members? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=302.56s)]
*  I know he had hinted at a blanket pardon for the January 6th thing for anybody, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=312.56s)]
*  but I think he had for all the staff and everyone involved, not with January 6th, but just before he left office, I know he had talked about that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=318.56s)]
*  The only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you've committed a crime. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=330.56s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=338.56s)]
*  That testimony coming at the end of today's hearing, confirming that the committee has evidence that at least a half dozen Republican members of Congress sought presidential pardons against potential criminal prosecution in the waning days of the Trump administration. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=340.56s)]
*  You add those six names to Trump lawyer John Eastman, who the committee revealed last week also asked for a presidential pardon for his role in this plot to overthrow the government. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=354.56s)]
*  I should mention that tonight many of those half dozen Republican members of Congress are denying this from the committee today. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=365.56s)]
*  Congressman Scott Perry said he stands by his statement that he never sought a pardon. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=370.56s)]
*  He said tonight, quote, This never happened. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=375.56s)]
*  Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene says the committee is, quote, spreading gossip and lies. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=378.56s)]
*  After the hearing, Congressman Mo Brooks released a copy of the email that was shown by investigators in part. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=384.56s)]
*  The copy shows that, in fact, he did request pardons for himself and a large number of congressional Republicans. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=389.56s)]
*  He did not deny that he sought a pardon. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=395.56s)]
*  He can't. It's right there in black and white. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=398.56s)]
*  He just wanted you to see more of the email in which he asked for one. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=400.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=403.56s)]
*  Congressman Brooks tells NBC that he sent this out of concern that, quote, Democrats would abuse the judicial system by prosecuting and jailing Republicans who acted pursuant to their constitutional or statutory duties. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=405.56s)]
*  And so all Republicans needed pardons. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=418.56s)]
*  And Matt Gaetz's pardon was supposed to be from the beginning of time up until today for any and all things. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=421.56s)]
*  And he started asking for that in early December. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=428.56s)]
*  That seems normal. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=431.56s)]
*  Any of all things. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=432.56s)]
*  That seems normal. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=433.56s)]
*  What things, I wonder. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=434.56s)]
*  Our colleague Stephanie Ruhl joins us now. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=435.56s)]
*  Stephanie, you said that you were most eager to talk about the congressional pardons today. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=436.56s)]
*  I am not so much the members of Congress, but the president. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=440.56s)]
*  Why didn't he give them pardon? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=444.56s)]
*  Why didn't he pardon them? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=446.56s)]
*  He had 100 percent control. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=447.56s)]
*  And he's OK with pardoning people who commit money laundering, all sorts of criminals. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=449.56s)]
*  But in this case, would they be his co-conspirators? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=455.56s)]
*  And I turn to Ari here because if any of them had been pardoned, they could turn around the next day and be asked to testify against Trump. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=458.56s)]
*  And if they were, they can't plead the fifth, which Jeffrey Clark did 105 times. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=466.56s)]
*  So did former President Trump not pardon them because it would hurt him? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=472.56s)]
*  That's the question I have. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=477.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, given that he pardoned Roger Stone and Steve Bannon and others, the self-interest really seems to be a big issue here. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=478.56s)]
*  Michael Flynn poof made things better for Paul Manafort, but this would touch him. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=484.56s)]
*  This would hurt him. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=488.56s)]
*  I mean, all this talk about blanket pardons, this isn't Bed Bath and Beyond. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=489.56s)]
*  You can't just say you get a pardon for all time for anything and wrap yourself in it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=493.56s)]
*  The Nixon example is interesting that the former lawyer for the White House mentioned because you have to write it down. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=497.56s)]
*  And so to your point, if you start writing down what you're pardoning, obstruction of a proceeding, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=502.56s)]
*  a plan inside the government to do selective prosecution, as we were discussing earlier, to abuse investigative findings, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=509.56s)]
*  those are all things coming out of the White House Oval Office of Donald Trump. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=516.56s)]
*  So yes, writing it out might actually incriminate him. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=519.56s)]
*  It might just announce it. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=522.56s)]
*  And then secondarily, yes, it might also make the more subject to cooperation. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=524.56s)]
*  One other point, Rachel, I'm so glad everyone's hearing you emphasize that, yes, we can report out denials and what people are saying, but these are not equal. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=527.56s)]
*  We have people who have cooperated with the committee, who have provided testimony. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=536.56s)]
*  And the nature of these depositions, I just want to remind everyone and underscore, is that they were conducted separately. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=541.56s)]
*  So the people don't have the benefit of always getting all their stories straight. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=546.56s)]
*  And through that contemporaneous evidentiary process, they have found under oath testimony about these pardons. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=549.56s)]
*  And then you have some Republican members of Congress out here just saying, no, we deny it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=557.56s)]
*  So number one, that's not weighted equally. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=560.56s)]
*  Number two, if there are any Republican members of Congress who are serious about these denials, they could submit a signed and sworn affidavit to the committee. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=562.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=569.56s)]
*  And testify. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=570.56s)]
*  Or they could testify. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=571.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=572.56s)]
*  No, you go. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=573.56s)]
*  You go. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=574.56s)]
*  Okay, wait. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=575.56s)]
*  Rock paper scissors. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=576.56s)]
*  Okay, here you go. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=577.56s)]
*  I was just going to say that they all have different levels of exposure, right? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=578.56s)]
*  I mean, I am sort of fixated on the fact that Ali Alexander, who we know was a plotter, you know, in sort of the Stop the Steal movement, he named two of the people who are named here, right? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=582.56s)]
*  Biggs and Brooks are named by him and Gosar is the third. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=592.56s)]
*  Gosar is not on the list of people who are asking. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=595.56s)]
*  But people like Biggs and Brooks might have a different level of accountability since they've been named by another guy who we know is a conspirator in the thing that became the violence. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=597.56s)]
*  In the criminal part. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=605.56s)]
*  In the criminal part. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=606.56s)]
*  And then you have people like Perry, who we now know is pushing this environmental lawyer to become the attorney general. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=607.56s)]
*  They're all different. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=612.56s)]
*  Someone like Marjorie Taylor Greene, we were talking about this a little bit in the break. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=613.56s)]
*  She may just think because she went to the meeting, I might be in trouble. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=616.56s)]
*  You just don't know what their level is. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=619.56s)]
*  But a couple of these people might want to actually need a pardon. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=621.56s)]
*  They might actually need it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=624.56s)]
*  And there was contemporaneous reporting at the end of the Trump presidency about him seeking legal opinions about a blanket pardon. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=625.56s)]
*  And I come back to the simple anything. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=632.56s)]
*  Liz Cheney has only used these hearings to publicly plead with one witness to cooperate and do his duty. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=634.56s)]
*  It's Pat Cipollone. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=639.56s)]
*  And I think the reason that we may never hear from him is from what you're talking about. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=640.56s)]
*  If you have to put on paper and to your point, I mean, there's not much that any of them did that Trump didn't do or direct. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=644.56s)]
*  What they're guilty of is helping or covering up for him. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=651.56s)]
*  And it's not like he's doing nothing. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=655.56s)]
*  Right. The Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=656.56s)]
*  Trump's inner circle. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=658.56s)]
*  They're getting them friendly lawyers. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=660.56s)]
*  Sidney Powell's fund is paying for those lawyers. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=661.56s)]
*  Just yesterday, the Department of Justice objected to the fact that Powell is paying for the Oath Keepers lawyers. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=664.56s)]
*  What did you do to Devin Nunes? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=670.56s)]
*  I'm going to get you a better job. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=672.56s)]
*  You're not going to be powerful in government. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=673.56s)]
*  I'm going to make you rich working for me. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=675.56s)]
*  So he's doing all these things on the edges saying I'm going to help you in a million dollar donation to the nonprofit that employs Mark Meadows. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=677.56s)]
*  Right around the time that Mark Meadows decided maybe I'm not going to cooperate with the hearing with the investigators anymore. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=683.56s)]
*  But what they all really do potentially need is a pardon. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=689.56s)]
*  But he's not touching that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=693.56s)]
*  That could hurt him. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=695.56s)]
*  . [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdnUNKw2cZ0&t=719.56s)]
