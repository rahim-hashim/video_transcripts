# Senator Hassan Shames Republicans For Failure To Stand Up For Democracy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo)
*  Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas at one point tried to say that Democrats were [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=0.0s)]
*  hypocrites because he read a letter from 2017 in which several Democratic senators said [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=4.88s)]
*  they supported keeping the filibuster as it is. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=11.4s)]
*  One of the senators who signed that letter is New Hampshire Democratic Senator Maggie [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=15.8s)]
*  Hassan who has talked here on the show a couple of times, including last night, about how [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=19.14s)]
*  her position on the filibuster has evolved and why. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=23.28s)]
*  After Senator Cotton invoked her and the other Democratic senators who signed that letter, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=27.0s)]
*  Senator Hassan actually got up for an impromptu response. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=32.92s)]
*  This was really interesting. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=36.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=37.0s)]
*  I know I was not scheduled to speak, but I do want to respond as one of the signatories [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=38.0s)]
*  of the letter. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=44.32s)]
*  I associate myself with everything that the other signatories have talked about in terms [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=45.32s)]
*  of wanting to restore the Senate's tradition of extended debate on issues of grave importance [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=50.32s)]
*  to the American people. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=56.92s)]
*  But let me be clear about the reason that I now support an adjustment to the long-standing [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=58.72s)]
*  rules of the Senate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=68.64s)]
*  And it is because I never imagined when I signed that letter that not a single member [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=70.6s)]
*  of the Republican Party would stand up for our democracy since January 6 when we saw [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=76.28s)]
*  an acceleration of state laws that would allow partisans to overturn the impartial count [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=85.52s)]
*  of an election. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=92.6s)]
*  But if we do not have a functioning democracy where people know that when they vote, that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=93.98s)]
*  vote will be impartially counted and upheld, and the people who are defeated will accept [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=101.48s)]
*  defeat so that they can have an accountable elected representation in Washington, then [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=106.88s)]
*  there is no democracy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  And when I signed that letter, I never imagined that today's Republican Party would fail [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=116.88s)]
*  to stand up for democracy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv1JYJ8siqo&t=125.08s)]
