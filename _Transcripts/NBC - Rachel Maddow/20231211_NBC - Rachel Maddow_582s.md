# Texas abortion ban, Republican politics drive woman out of state for life-saving care
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4)
*  In the Trump presidency, Republicans finally succeeded in their machinations to stack the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. Supreme Court with hardline anti-abortion conservatives, and then they were able to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=5.12s)]
*  get through the policy they most wanted. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=9.96s)]
*  They overturned Roe v. Wade, and that allowed Republican-controlled states all over the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=12.58s)]
*  country to ban abortion. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=16.6s)]
*  And even those bans have not been enough for Republicans in many states. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=18.56s)]
*  Republicans are now proposing in the state of Missouri, for example, that abortion be [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=23.64s)]
*  charged as homicide, that abortion be charged criminally as murder. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=27.1s)]
*  Republicans in the Missouri House and the Missouri Senate are now proposing murder charges [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=33.660000000000004s)]
*  for abortion in legislation that they are bringing up this month. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=38.300000000000004s)]
*  This comes after Republicans have proposed similar legislation in Kentucky and in Georgia [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=42.72s)]
*  and in Arkansas and in South Carolina and in Colorado. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=48.3s)]
*  Republicans in all of those states have proposed murder charges for abortion, which usually, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  of course, means life in prison or even the possibility of capital punishment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=56.9s)]
*  In Ohio, a young woman is newly facing criminal charges for having had a miscarriage at home, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=61.5s)]
*  bringing criminal charges against her, threatening her with prison for the handling of the fetal [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=69.98s)]
*  remains after she miscarried at home. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=75.34s)]
*  And in Texas, the case of 31-year-old Kate Cox has played out over these last few days [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=80.02s)]
*  as a Republican fantasy of how they would most like to wield really, really, really, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=86.14s)]
*  really big government. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=91.82s)]
*  Kate Cox is a mother of two. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=95.02s)]
*  She's 31 years old. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=96.62s)]
*  She very much has wanted a third child. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=98.26s)]
*  She was pregnant with that third child when she learned that it would not be a viable [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=100.26s)]
*  pregnancy, a fatal genetic abnormality. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=104.58s)]
*  She had already been in and out of the hospital with fairly serious complications in this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=108.34s)]
*  pregnancy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=112.1s)]
*  Her doctor advised her that if she wants to be able to try again, if she and her husband [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=113.1s)]
*  want to try to get pregnant again, to try for another child, which they desperately [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=117.3s)]
*  want, this non-viable pregnancy must be ended by abortion in order to protect her health [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  and potentially to save her life. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=126.97999999999999s)]
*  But Texas bans abortion because Texas is a Republican-controlled state. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=130.7s)]
*  So Kate Cox had to go to court to try to get an exception from Texas' abortion ban. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=135.38s)]
*  And a Texas judge ruled late last week that she could have an exception from the abortion [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=141.24s)]
*  ban. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=145.84s)]
*  She could get this abortion in this special case to preserve her health, to potentially [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=146.84s)]
*  preserve her own life. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=150.68s)]
*  The Texas Republican attorney general responded by writing to Kate Cox's doctor and to the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=153.28s)]
*  Texas hospitals where the doctor has admitting privileges. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=159.08s)]
*  Texas attorney general threatening that he would potentially criminally prosecute them [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=162.12s)]
*  If they did the abortion, regardless of that Texas court ruling. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=167.88s)]
*  He then filed an appeal with the Texas Supreme Court. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=171.72s)]
*  Texas Supreme Court only has Republican judges on it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=174.84s)]
*  And that all-Republican Supreme Court in Texas promptly agreed to hear the appeal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=178.76s)]
*  That stayed the lower court ruling. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=184.92s)]
*  The practical effect of that is that Kate Cox was once again legally blocked from being [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=186.64s)]
*  able to get an abortion in Texas. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=190.94s)]
*  And then the Supreme Court just sat on it and did nothing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  They blocked the ruling allowing her abortion on Friday and then they just sat on it all [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  weekend and today. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  Who knows when they would have got around to finally making some sort of decision about [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=207.76s)]
*  She's already 20 weeks pregnant, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=208.76s)]
*  She's been in and out of the emergency room at least four times with complications from [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=210.92s)]
*  this pregnancy, but no rush, guys. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  Today Ms. Cox's legal counsel, the Center for Reproductive Rights, announced that Ms. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=218.84s)]
*  Cox finally was effectively forced to flee. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=222.34s)]
*  She left the state to go to some safer place where there isn't a ban like this one that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=227.86s)]
*  Republicans have imposed in Texas. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=233.1s)]
*  Nancy Northup, the chief executive for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=235.94s)]
*  been representing Ms. Cox in this case, said this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=239.26s)]
*  She said, quote, Kate desperately wanted to be able to get care where she lives and recover [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=242.1s)]
*  at home surrounded by family. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=245.78s)]
*  While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not and a situation like this [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=247.9s)]
*  could be a death sentence. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=253.58s)]
*  That was this afternoon. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=257.06s)]
*  And now tonight, hours after that announcement from the Center for Reproductive Rights, hours [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=259.58s)]
*  after we learned that Kate Cox had to leave the state of Texas so she could get this abortion [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=263.8s)]
*  somewhere else. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=268.26s)]
*  Tonight, the Texas Supreme Court has nevertheless just issued its ruling in this case. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=269.42s)]
*  They ruled that the lower court was wrong to give Kate Cox an exception to the ban. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=275.18s)]
*  They ruled that Kate Cox effectively should have been forced by the government of the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=279.54s)]
*  state of Texas to carry this pregnancy to term of a baby that would not live despite [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=285.02s)]
*  the fact that doing so would risk her health, would risk her ability to ever have a child [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=290.14s)]
*  again and potentially even risk her death. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=294.1s)]
*  A government would compel that of her and her body. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  While the Republican Attorney General threatened criminal prosecution of anyone who helped [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=304.32s)]
*  her in a state where the penalty for helping a woman in this circumstance is up to 99 [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=308.24s)]
*  years in prison. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=314.84s)]
*  Because you know, limited government, freedom. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=318.28s)]
*  Joining us now is Nancy Northup, President and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  It's a group that's been representing Kate Cox and her case against the state of Texas. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=327.56s)]
*  Ms. Northup, thanks very much for being here. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=331.32s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for covering this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  Did I get any of that wrong? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  No, unfortunately you got it all right. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean just imagine as you went through what Kate went through this week. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  First she had a terrible diagnosis. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  Then she had to go to court, plead in front of the court, you know, in front of the world, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  right, because it's on video, to get basic health care. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=354.04s)]
*  She has the judge rules that she can and yet as you pointed out, Attorney General Paxton [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=359.0s)]
*  says no, you know, I'm threatening your doctors, I'm threatening the hospitals and eventually [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  she has to flee the state as she did today. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=368.72s)]
*  I mean we're at the point in the United States where we have reproductive freedom states [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=371.48s)]
*  and we have reproductive oppression states and one has to flee an oppression state to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=376.2s)]
*  be able to get basic health care. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=381.2s)]
*  But that's what Kate has gone through this week. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=383.52s)]
*  It is unacceptable, but that is what we're living with in post-Roe America. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=385.4s)]
*  I know that Ms. Cox has left the state of Texas seeking care elsewhere. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=391.08s)]
*  I'm not going to ask you obviously to disclose anything about the circumstances of where [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=396.64s)]
*  she is or what she had to do, but can you tell us if she's okay? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  She's okay. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=403.32s)]
*  She's had a really, really devastating time. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=404.32s)]
*  I mean as you pointed out, all weekend long waiting and hoping that the Texas Supreme [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=407.76s)]
*  Court would rule that she could go ahead as the district court ruled, having heard [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=413.12s)]
*  the medical evidence, that she could have the abortion in the state of Texas to preserve [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=417.88s)]
*  her health, to preserve her future fertility. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=421.72s)]
*  And despite all that, that ruling did not come. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=424.76s)]
*  It is just simply devastating. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=428.06s)]
*  What do you make of the ruling that they issued tonight? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  I did not know if the case would be considered moot and they would decide that they didn't [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=434.96s)]
*  have to rule once your office had announced that she had left the state and was obtaining [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=438.5s)]
*  the procedure elsewhere. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=442.64s)]
*  They nevertheless decided to rule. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=443.91999999999996s)]
*  Was that definitely going to happen either way? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  Do you have a reaction to the ruling? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=447.44s)]
*  I mean the ruling did not give any more clarity and guidance to doctors about when they can [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=449.12s)]
*  perform abortions in the state of Texas. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=455.2s)]
*  So we're right back into the place that we have been for a very long time. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=457.52s)]
*  Court's not giving guidance. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=461.56s)]
*  The state's medical board's not giving guidance. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  And Attorney General Ken Paxton is running around telling everybody that nothing qualifies [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  under their exception. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=470.4s)]
*  It also just shows how these medical health exceptions that these states pass saying, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  oh no, we're compassionate, we have these health exceptions, they don't mean anything [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=476.91999999999996s)]
*  because nobody can access them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  This is a difficult question and please tell me if I'm off base in asking it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=484.56s)]
*  But given what Attorney General Ken Paxton did here after that initial court ruling in [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=488.12s)]

*  and threatening criminal prosecution of anybody who helped Ms. Cox and her family in this case. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=500.0s)]
*  Is it possible that Ms. Cox and her husband could face like civil suits or charges? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=506.8s)]
*  Are they potentially liable as Texas residents for somebody like Ken Paxton coming after them, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=512.48s)]
*  even though they had to leave the state to get this done? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=518.56s)]

*  That would be extreme intimidation and it would be a misuse of the prosecutorial authority [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  of the state of Texas. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=535.12s)]
*  Let's hope that does not happen and people should know you can go to a reproductive freedom state [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=538.0s)]
*  and get health care that you need. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvK0BIq1DM4&t=544.24s)]
