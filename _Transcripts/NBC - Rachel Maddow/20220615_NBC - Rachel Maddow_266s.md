# Jan. 6 Committee Releases Loudermilk Tour Video After 'Weird Letter' From Capitol Police
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw)
*  Joining us now is California congresswoman, member of the January 6th investigation, Zoe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=0.0s)]
*  Lofgren. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=4.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Lofgren, it's a real pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=5.0s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=9.64s)]
*  Good to be here, Rachel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=10.64s)]
*  Let me just give you a chance to correct me if I explained any of that wrongly. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=12.96s)]
*  That's how I understand it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  We've been following this for more than a year now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=17.72s)]
*  Did I get any of that the wrong way around? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=19.76s)]
*  No, I think you've got it right. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=21.88s)]
*  Bonnie Davis is the ranking member of the House Administration Committee that I chair. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=28.72s)]
*  He and Mr. Loudermilk, who also serves on the House Administration Committee, had demanded [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=33.76s)]
*  the release of footage and claimed that they had seen all of the videos and there was nothing [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=39.64s)]
*  there, no one with a MAGA hat. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=46.32s)]
*  When we found the videos of Mr. Loudermilk leading a tour, we did ask him to come in. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=49.72s)]
*  We didn't accuse him of anything. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=57.36s)]
*  We just asked him to come in and talk to us and he refused to do it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  And then, of course, we got this weird letter from the Capitol Police Chief and we thought, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=63.92s)]
*  well, you know, we were going to show him this video, Mr. Loudermilk, privately and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  ask him about it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=76.76s)]
*  So now he has a copy of it, as does the rest of the public. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  We'd still like to hear from him. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=82.88s)]
*  Are we right to surmise him? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=86.08s)]
*  Am I right to surmise tonight that you and the other investigators have confirmed the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=87.12s)]
*  identity of the person who's seen on that tour taking pictures in the House Office buildings [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  and that that is the same person who's heard making those threats against members of Congress [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=96.72s)]
*  at the Capitol attack the next day? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=101.4s)]
*  You know for sure that that's the same person? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=102.84s)]
*  It's my understanding, yes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=107.72s)]
*  Congressman Loudermilk said these were constituents from Georgia. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=108.72s)]
*  He said they were not members of the mob. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=112.64s)]
*  You have confirmed that one member of the tour participated in the events of January 6th. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=115.14s)]
*  How does this fit into the overall investigation that you and your colleagues are conducting? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=122.86s)]
*  I mean, I think when Mikey Sherrill and colleagues raised these concerns at the beginning, I [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=128.26s)]
*  think it sent a chill down the collective spine of the nation with the idea that some [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=132.98s)]
*  members of Congress might knowingly have abetted people who are participating in the January [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=137.72s)]
*  6th events in trying to hunt down individual members of Congress and menace them more effectively. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=142.94000000000003s)]
*  That's the scary implication here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  Is that in fact what you believe you have stumbled upon? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=150.3s)]
*  Well, we don't know that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=153.5s)]
*  I mean, we have not accused Representative Loudermilk of that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=155.3s)]
*  We said we wanted to talk to him. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=158.58s)]
*  That he won't talk to us is concerning to me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, he led a tour. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=165.74s)]
*  I mean, they took video of the tunnel from the Rayburn building to the Capitol. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=169.38s)]
*  That was the same tunnel. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=177.06s)]
*  The next day, I was evacuated through that tunnel from the House floor. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=178.74s)]
*  They took video of the stairwell that led into the Ways and Means Committee room where [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  like a hundred or so members of Congress were sheltered in place after the evacuation from [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=191.82s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=198.86s)]
*  So we'd like to know about this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=199.86s)]
*  And, you know, to say he actually filed an ethics complaint, that was bizarre when he [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=201.38000000000002s)]
*  must have. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=208.38000000000002s)]
*  Well, he knew he himself led a tour. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=209.38000000000002s)]
*  And let's remember that the Capitol was completely closed to the public because of the COVID. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=213.74s)]
*  One of the Capitol Police told me yesterday that they were told that they couldn't even [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=220.46s)]
*  bring their own families into the Capitol complex. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  It's completely closed. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=228.02s)]
*  California congressman, member of the January 6 investigation, Zoe Lofgren, we look forward [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=229.26s)]
*  to tomorrow's hearing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=234.5s)]
*  Thanks for helping us understand the committee's work. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=236.3s)]
*  I appreciate you being here, Mel. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=237.74s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiw2eORgTfw&t=240.02s)]
