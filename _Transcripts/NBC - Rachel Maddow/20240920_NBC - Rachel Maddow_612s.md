# 'Worst theme week ever': Shocking Nazi streak runs through Trump campaign
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k)
*  In contrast to Harris jetting from Michigan to Georgia to Wisconsin in this one 24-hour [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=0.0s)]
*  period, Trump in this 24-hour period has kind of gone fallow today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=5.84s)]
*  No events, no travel, no appearances. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=11.48s)]
*  I don't know what he's doing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=13.84s)]
*  That said, that may potentially be for the best for his campaign. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=16.12s)]
*  I say that because the last event he did for his campaign was yesterday, and it produced [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=20.68s)]
*  headlines like this all day today. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=26.12s)]
*  This was at Huffington Post today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=30.04s)]
*  Don shocks. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=31.92s)]
*  If I lose, blame the Jews. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=33.72s)]
*  Now, I should say, in fairness, in fairness, I need to note that this headline from our [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=37.36s)]
*  friends at Huffington Post is entirely accurate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=43.72s)]
*  I mean, you may think they are exaggerating with a headline like that, but they are not. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=48.6s)]
*  Here's what it looks like at the Drudge Report tonight. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  Blame the Jews if I lose. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  And again, in fairness to the people who operate the Drudge Report, that headline is accurate [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  because that is a fair characterization. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=65.0s)]
*  That is actually what Trump said. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=67.64s)]
*  And he did it twice. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=70.0s)]
*  It started at an event that was supposed to be against anti-Semitism. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=73.48s)]
*  Stick a pin in that amazing fact just for a moment. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=77.88s)]
*  But he got up at this event yesterday and he said this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  He said, quote, I am not going to call this a prediction, but in my opinion, the Jewish [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=82.64s)]
*  people would have a lot to do with a loss, meaning they'd have a lot to do with an election [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=87.92s)]
*  loss by him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=94.8s)]
*  That was the first event. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=97.2s)]
*  Then he went to a second event the same night last night. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=98.68s)]
*  And he said it again, even more pointedly, just in case people didn't get it the first [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=101.48s)]
*  time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  He said at the second event, quote, if I don't win this election, the Jewish people would [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  really have a lot to do with that if it happens. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=112.36s)]
*  These were not closed door events. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=118.12s)]
*  These were not off the record events. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=120.08s)]
*  This is him putting it on the record for the American people. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=122.26s)]
*  Hey, if I lose the election, blame the Jews. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=125.52s)]
*  I'm not going to call this as a prediction, but in my opinion, the Jewish people would [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=131.04s)]
*  have a lot to do with a loss. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=136.96s)]
*  If I don't win this election and the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=139.4s)]
*  that if that happens. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=144.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=146.56s)]
*  I mean, what could possibly go wrong? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=148.6s)]
*  Jews are like 2% of the American population. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=152.4s)]
*  According to the Republican candidate for president and former president, if anything [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=155.84s)]
*  goes wrong in this next election for him, blame the Jews. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=161.12s)]
*  It'll be the Jews' fault. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=164.96s)]
*  2.4% of the American population. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=167.92s)]
*  Put it on them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=170.64s)]
*  As I mentioned, the first comments from him were at an event which is supposed to be an [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=173.14s)]
*  anti-antisemitism event. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=178.04s)]
*  What is antisemitism again? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=180.98s)]
*  Well, most of the time, it's people saying, hey, pay no attention to who's ostensibly [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  in charge because really it's the Jews in charge. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=186.32s)]
*  And so you can blame them for all bad things. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  Most of the time, that is what antisemitism looks like, which is exactly what Trump is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=191.82s)]
*  doing. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=198.5s)]
*  Just astonishing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=200.66s)]
*  We're 46 days out and the Republican candidate for president is telling America, if I lose, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=201.66s)]
*  blame Jewish people. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=208.5s)]
*  That is really where we are in the campaign right now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=211.62s)]
*  And it turns out it's worse because this is not just a couple of comments at a couple [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  of adjacent events. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=218.74s)]
*  This is turning into kind of a theme week for them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=220.16s)]
*  Remember when he used to declare infrastructure week all the time and nothing ever happened? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=222.04s)]
*  This is a different kind of week, a much worse one. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=225.62s)]
*  All in the space of a few days, we've got Trump saying twice, if I lose the election, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  blame the Jews. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=232.84s)]
*  Within a day of that, we also get the release of an interview that his running mate did [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=234.34s)]
*  with an RNC primetime speaker, former host from the Fox News Channel, who very famously [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=238.76s)]
*  a celebratory, laudatory, totally uncritical two hour fan fest interview with a Holocaust [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=247.3s)]
*  denier in which the two of them talked about how Hitler wasn't the bad guy in World War [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=254.86s)]
*  II. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=260.5s)]
*  I mean, this is a guy to be clear who says we need to be more understanding of the fact [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=261.5s)]
*  that really Hitler was just looking for a solution in his words for quote, an acceptable [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=265.86s)]
*  solution to the Jewish problem. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=272.62s)]
*  That's all he was doing. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=275.3s)]
*  Why can't we be more understanding of that? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=276.3s)]
*  He wasn't a bad guy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=277.94s)]
*  He was just looking for an acceptable solution to the Jewish problem. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=279.58s)]
*  After this former Fox News host and the primetime RNC speaker interviewed him for two hours [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=287.1s)]
*  and praised him as the best public historian in the country, his podcast or his own podcast, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  the Holocaust Denier Guy, went to number one in the country. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=299.22s)]
*  And the most notorious, like famous godfathers of Holocaust denial in this country all praised [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=302.46s)]
*  it, right? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=307.82s)]
*  Said they wanted credit. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=308.82s)]
*  Finally, their words are getting out there. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=309.82s)]
*  Number one podcast in the country on Apple podcasts. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=312.18s)]
*  On the day the White House had to put out a denunciation of that guy and the fact that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  an RNC primetime speaker just did a laudatory two hour interview praising him. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=321.9s)]
*  On the same day the White House had to put out their denunciation of that, JD Vance, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=328.54s)]
*  the Republican nominee for vice president, taped an interview with that same RNC speaker [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  and Fox News host who had just celebrated America's best public historian as America's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=339.72s)]
*  best public historian, this Holocaust denial guy. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  So now that JD Vance interview, which was taped at that auspicious time, it's just [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=350.70000000000005s)]
*  come out. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=355.70000000000005s)]
*  Great timing, right in time for blame the Jews day from his running mate. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=356.7s)]
*  In that interview, which again has just come out, JD Vance makes the case that we don't [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=362.97999999999996s)]
*  really have a democracy in this country. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=367.82s)]
*  And why not? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=371.58s)]
*  We shouldn't have a democracy in the future. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=372.98s)]
*  It's not making that argument, although he kind of is. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=374.62s)]
*  What he's saying is that we don't have a democracy now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=376.53999999999996s)]
*  And why is it that he thinks we don't have a democracy now? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=379.7s)]
*  Because he says there's a secret powerful group who really controls things behind the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=383.64s)]
*  scenes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=388.28s)]
*  So we should blame them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=389.7s)]
*  In reality, right now we don't live in a real democracy in this country, right? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=392.7s)]
*  The people who call the shots in this country have further and further divorced themselves [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=396.68s)]
*  from any kind of real democratic accountability, right? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=402.18s)]
*  It's like a junior high school class and how this stuff works. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=406.8s)]
*  Why exactly do we always get like Holocaust denial and weird blame the Jews stuff going [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=411.84s)]
*  along with anti-democratic movements and movements to end democracy and to install a strong man [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=417.11999999999995s)]
*  or a fascist form of government instead? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=422.26s)]
*  Why do these things go together? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=425.76s)]
*  Well, wouldn't you know it, that specific idea also came up. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=427.38s)]
*  So if you guys win and you start firing people who are acting against orders of their commander [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=431.85999999999996s)]
*  in chief and against the expressed will of voters, the New York Times will call it a [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=439.2s)]
*  fascist takeover. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=442.4s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=443.4s)]
*  So the question is, do you care? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=444.4s)]
*  Well, I think we have to not care. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=445.96s)]
*  We have to not care. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=448.72s)]
*  Yes, yes, what we're going to do, some people will call it a fascist takeover, but that's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=450.92s)]
*  not, you know, any concern to us. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=456.88s)]
*  It's what we're going to do. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=459.44s)]
*  So we're not going to care when they call it a fascist takeover. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=460.48s)]
*  Because after all, our so-called democracy is a sham anyway. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=465.6s)]
*  Would it really be so bad to give it up since we all know who's really in charge? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=468.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=473.6s)]
*  And Trump says you can blame them if he loses. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=474.6s)]
*  I mean, this is the worst theme week ever. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=477.88s)]
*  Trump did his blame the Jews thing yesterday twice, just after the yes, it's going to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=482.44s)]
*  look like a fascist takeover and no, we don't care interview came out. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=487.04s)]
*  Now, today, they're doing nothing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=490.8s)]
*  Neither of them doing any campaign stuff at all. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=493.04s)]
*  Tomorrow, JD Vance is going to do a live appearance with that same same interviewer, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  a for-profit ticketed event. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=499.36s)]
*  And Trump is going to go to North Carolina tomorrow, where his campaign says he has no [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=502.16s)]
*  plans to distance himself from or denounce the Republican candidate for governor who [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=506.0s)]
*  Trump endorsed there. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  The same candidate who reportedly announced himself online years ago as, quote, a black [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  Nazi, quote, I'm a black Nazi. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=517.0s)]
*  The all capitals on the word Nazi and the exclamation point at the end of it, those [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=521.56s)]
*  are not my embellishments. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=525.8399999999999s)]
*  Those are his. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=527.88s)]
*  According to online posts that CNN has somewhat meticulously documented as those of Trump [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=529.4799999999999s)]
*  endorsed Republican candidate for North Carolina governor Mark Robinson. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=534.7199999999999s)]
*  And other online posts, he said he preferred Hitler to any American politician in Washington. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=539.52s)]
*  Now, the latest reporting tonight is that his online remarks also include him explicitly [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=546.4399999999999s)]
*  praising Mein Kampf. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  So Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson is denying all of this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  He is rejecting calls to quit the governor's race in North Carolina. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=563.16s)]
*  No Republicans in the state appear to have denounced him for these specific posts in [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=567.16s)]
*  which he praises Hitler and proclaims himself to be a Nazi. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=572.0799999999999s)]
*  No Republicans in the state apparently feel the need to distance themselves from it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=575.52s)]
*  And apparently neither does Trump. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=579.72s)]
*  The deadline for removing Mr. Robinson from the ballot passed at midnight last night. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=581.6s)]
*  So apparently they are they are sticking with him. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=586.76s)]
*  I told you this is the worst theme week ever. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mDKRggaF-k&t=589.16s)]
