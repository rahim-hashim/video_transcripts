# Trump-Inspired Anti-Democracy Activism Spreads In New Mexico
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8)
*  My vote tonight is going to be no. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=0.0s)]
*  And my vote to remain a no isn't based on any evidence. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=3.0s)]
*  It's not based on any facts. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=10.0s)]
*  It's only based on my gut feeling and my own intuition. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=12.0s)]
*  And that's all I need to base my vote on the elections right there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=17.0s)]
*  It isn't based on any evidence. It's not based on any facts. Who needs them? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=22.0s)]
*  That was a county commission meeting in Otero County, New Mexico this past Friday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=26.0s)]
*  County commissioners met to certify the results of recent elections, elections in which there were no complaints about fraud or irregularities at all. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=30.0s)]
*  As we reported on the show last week, Republicans in Otero County were threatening, this county commission was threatening that they wouldn't certify the election results because something, something, Donald Trump, voting machines, bamboo fibers, Rudy Giuliani, something, something. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=40.0s)]
*  Not really based on any facts, just bad feelings. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=54.0s)]
*  On Friday, the state Supreme Court in New Mexico ordered the county to drop the nonsense and certify the elections. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=57.0s)]
*  They did by two to one vote. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=63.0s)]
*  The one no vote was that disembodied voice you heard at that meeting on Friday saying he was still voting no, but not because of any facts. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=66.0s)]
*  The reason he's a disembodied voice at that meeting is because he had to phone into that hearing from D.C. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=74.0s)]
*  He was in D.C. because he was being sentenced by a federal judge for his part in the January 6th attack. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=79.0s)]
*  So that's how it worked out in Otero County. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=85.0s)]
*  Court order begrudging agreement. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=88.0s)]
*  But look at this. Look at what happened that same day in two other counties in New Mexico as officials in other counties voted to certify their own primary elections. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=91.0s)]
*  This is our county. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=101.0s)]
*  This is our county. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=104.0s)]
*  You need to hear us and you may not push us out of the meeting. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=107.0s)]
*  We have the fear to be heard. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=111.0s)]
*  I'm going to let you, can I, can I, I'm going, we can continue this in our own if you would like to leave, sir. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=114.0s)]
*  This is your only warning. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=120.0s)]
*  Who elected you? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=122.0s)]
*  I'm calling the vote. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=125.0s)]
*  Commissioner Candler. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=127.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=128.0s)]
*  Commissioner Schwab. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=129.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=130.0s)]
*  Commissioner McClellan. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=131.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=132.0s)]
*  Now we're traitors. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=133.0s)]
*  Now we're traitors. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=134.0s)]
*  Now we're traitors. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=135.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=136.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=137.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=138.0s)]
*  Now we're traitors. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=139.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=140.0s)]
*  Now we're traitors. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=141.0s)]
*  What country? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=142.0s)]
*  I just sent him out of the shot already. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=143.0s)]
*  I sent him over to watch you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=144.0s)]
*  I sent him over to watch you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=145.0s)]
*  Your legacy is like this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=146.0s)]
*  What is so good? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=147.0s)]
*  You should have been like Otero County. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=148.0s)]
*  You should have been like Otero County. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=155.0s)]
*  Again, no complaints of fraud or irregularities in these elections just don't certify election [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=157.0s)]
*  results anymore. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=161.0s)]
*  I mean, what happened in Otero County for all its clownishness was the first overt act [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=162.0s)]
*  we have seen taken by a Republican dominated elections body to nullify election results [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=169.0s)]
*  just on the basis of fact-free Trumpian extremism, just as a matter of Trumpie principle. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=174.44s)]
*  That happened in Otero County last week, but seeing other counties facing the same pressure [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=181.12s)]
*  is a clear and dark sign of where things are headed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=185.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=188.0s)]
*  This is not the same as angry conservatives showing up to complain at a local school board [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=189.0s)]
*  meeting or a zoning committee. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=192.0s)]
*  This is don't certify election results anymore. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=193.64s)]
*  This is an organized anti small D democratic movement in our country pushing to nullify [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  all election results. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=203.04s)]
*  And it is spreading. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=205.64s)]
*  It has started. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=207.01999999999998s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4qiYwkL4_8&t=208.01999999999998s)]
