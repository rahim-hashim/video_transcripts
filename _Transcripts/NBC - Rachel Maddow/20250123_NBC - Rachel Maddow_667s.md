# NEW: Hegseth divorce papers bar 2nd wife from publicly 'disparaging' statements
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI)
*  The kind of drunk that you take work folks to a strip club and so drunk then that you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=0.0s)]
*  try to get up on stage and dance with the strippers. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  The kind of drunk that stopped the Uber because you're going to vomit drunk. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=12.52s)]
*  Look, I understand there are people who have alcohol problems, but we cannot trust the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  safety of our country to someone who has demonstrated repeatedly using very bad judgment with alcohol [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=23.32s)]
*  and doing it in ways that truly have incapacitated him. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=33.56s)]
*  Senator Elizabeth Warren at her most memorable last night here on the show speaking on the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=39.24s)]
*  subject of Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=43.8s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth is the co-host of a weekend morning show on Fox News and now the nominee to be [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=45.72s)]
*  defense secretary in the Trump administration. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=53.24s)]
*  Despite concerns like the ones expressed by Senator Warren and other Democrats on the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=56.28s)]
*  Armed Services Committee, Pete Hegseth's nomination advanced today in the Senate largely [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  along party lines. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=64.28s)]
*  There were two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, who joined all Democrats [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  in voting no against him today. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=71.12s)]
*  That means if one more Republican joins the two of them in the final vote tomorrow, the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=73.48s)]
*  vote on him will be tied, but he'd still get through because J.D. Vance as vice president [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=79.36s)]
*  would break the tie in Pete Hegseth's favor. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=84.48s)]
*  If two more Republican senators said no, though, Mr. Hegseth's nomination would fail. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=87.76s)]
*  Even as the Hegseth nomination has continued to move forward, so has the reporting that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=93.16s)]
*  has Democrats and a few Republicans questioning whether he is an okay pick to oversee the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=98.36s)]
*  entire U.S. military. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=104.88s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth has been dogged by a long list of allegations, each of which he has denied. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=106.84s)]
*  He denies allegations of excessive drinking, including by work colleagues who said he was [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=111.68s)]
*  frequently drunk, sometimes very drunk, at work functions and that he had alcohol on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=116.2s)]
*  his breath even at his morning show job. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=122.68s)]
*  He denies alleged mismanagement of two nonprofits for veterans. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=126.0s)]
*  He denies an allegation of sexual assault in a 2017 case where prosecutors didn't press [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=130.0s)]
*  charges, but where Mr. Hegseth did reach an agreement with the woman who had gone to police, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=135.04s)]
*  the agreement included a payment to her that she should be quiet about it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=140.04s)]
*  Today we learned how much he paid. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=145.04s)]
*  Answering a written question from Senator Warren, Pete Hegseth said that he paid this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=147.2s)]
*  woman $50,000 for her silence. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=150.8s)]
*  But new questions this week about Hegseth began with a story first reported by NBC News. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=155.48s)]
*  Here's the headline. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=160.6s)]
*  Quote, Senators receive affidavit containing new allegations against Pete Hegseth, who [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=161.6s)]
*  denies the claims. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  The sworn affidavit comes from his former sister-in-law, a woman who was married to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=168.4s)]
*  his brother. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=173.2s)]
*  She submitted the affidavit at the request of the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  Committee. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=179.44s)]
*  NBC News reporting, quote, Danielle Hegseth described in the affidavit allegations of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=180.44s)]
*  volatile and threatening conduct by Hegseth that made his second wife, Samantha, fear [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=185.0s)]
*  for her safety. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=190.04s)]
*  And the affidavit, the former sister-in-law, details instances in which she says she was, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=192.04s)]
*  quote, a witness to and even a victim of emotional abuse by Pete Hegseth. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=197.04s)]
*  She says she personally witnessed him abusing alcohol numerous times. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=201.88s)]
*  That reporting is what Warren was responding to so memorably last night. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=206.72s)]
*  An attorney for Hegseth denied the story, telling NBC News, excuse me, telling NBC News [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=212.2s)]
*  that Hegseth's ex-wife, quote, has never alleged that there was any abuse. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=219.0s)]
*  She signed court documents acknowledging there was no abuse. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=223.4s)]
*  She recently reaffirmed the same during her FBI interview. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=225.84s)]
*  The ex-wife herself told NBC there was no physical abuse in my marriage, end quote, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=230.24s)]
*  I have not and will not comment on my marriage to Pete Hegseth. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=235.16000000000003s)]
*  For the record, NBC reports that she gave the FBI a prepared statement that said Hegseth [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=239.88s)]
*  has had and continues to have a problem with alcohol abuse. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=245.6s)]
*  But the question of whether Hegseth's two ex-wives were able to publicly discuss details [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=249.6s)]
*  of their marriages to Pete Hegseth, that came up during his Senate hearing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=259.4s)]
*  In finalizing divorces from your first and second wives, were there nondisclosure agreements [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=264.4s)]
*  in connection with those divorces? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=270.64s)]
*  Senator, not that I'm aware of. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  If there were, would you agree to release those first and second wives from any confidentiality agreement? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=275.64000000000004s)]
*  Senator, it's not something I'm aware of. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  But if there were, you would agree to release them from a confidentiality? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=283.6s)]
*  Senator, that's not my responsibility. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=286.44s)]
*  Turns out that while this is not a full nondisclosure agreement, there is something in the divorce [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=291.12s)]
*  papers from Pete Hegseth's second marriage. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  What is worth knowing about, given how his confirmation hearings have gone? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=303.36s)]
*  Check this out. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=308.36s)]
*  This is the divorce decree from 2018 in the Minnesota court system. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=309.36s)]
*  MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Rubin was able to obtain this today. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=313.36s)]
*  You can see the decree contains a quote, parenting plan, setting out how the Hegseths [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=318.36s)]
*  would handle taking care of the kids after the divorce. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=323.36s)]
*  Part of that plan includes quote, avoiding derogatory comments. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=326.36s)]
*  They both signed this document, Pete Hegseth and his second ex-wife, Samantha. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  Again, to be clear, this clause is not a full nondisclosure agreement. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=359.8s)]
*  A lawyer for Mr. Hegseth, Tim Parlatori, tells MSNBC, quote, it is a limited nondisparagement agreement. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=363.8s)]
*  These are two legally distinct concepts. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=371.8s)]
*  There's nothing inappropriate or inaccurate about Mr. Hegseth's answers to the committee. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=373.8s)]
*  It takes some significant imagination and intellectual dishonesty for anyone to consider [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=377.79999999999995s)]
*  this to bear on the credibility of his testimony. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=382.79999999999995s)]
*  Both parties will refrain from engaging in any public discourse disparaging the other party. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=389.8s)]
*  Senator Kaine provided a statement to MSNBC as well, saying, quote, that clause in a divorce [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=395.8s)]
*  settlement could expose someone to severe consequences for sharing unflattering information [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=400.8s)]
*  about an ex-partner, even if that information is true. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=405.79999999999995s)]
*  The existence of this agreement, which has not been previously reported, seems important [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=410.79999999999995s)]
*  on the eve of Pete Hegseth's confirmation vote tomorrow in the United States Senate, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=417.12s)]
*  one that seems to hinge on just one or two votes. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=422.12s)]
*  Joining us now is Lisa Rubin, MSNBC legal correspondent. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=426.12s)]
*  Lisa, it's good to see you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=428.12s)]
*  Thanks for your reporting on this. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=429.12s)]
*  Good to see you, too. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=430.12s)]
*  Can you describe the document that you found? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=431.12s)]
*  Tell us how it fits into the broader picture of reporting on Hegseth. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=434.12s)]
*  Well, I think, Rachel, let's talk about, first, I want to clarify something. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=438.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=441.12s)]
*  This is not a full nondisparagement provision. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=442.12s)]
*  In fact, it's a very broad nondisparagement provision. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=445.64s)]
*  What it's not is a nondisclosure agreement in typical fashion. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=448.64s)]
*  In terms of how this fits into the larger reporting about Hegseth, Hegseth has been [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=452.64s)]
*  dogged by all sorts of allegations about his past, which you recounted in your earlier [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=456.64s)]
*  segment, including ones related to his two marriages. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=460.64s)]
*  The fact that Hegseth had denied that he had nondisclosure agreements might be technically [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=465.64s)]
*  correct, but we talk a lot about the difference between the letter of the law and the spirit [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=469.64s)]
*  of the law. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=472.64s)]
*  So, the nondisclosure versus nondisparagement is the distinction. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  That's correct, but functionally, even though this doesn't say either one of them can't [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  say anything, functionally, this operates almost as if it were a nondisclosure agreement, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  because by agreeing not to engage in any, and this is the quote, public discourse that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  would disparage the other spouse, essentially, Samantha Hegseth has her hands tied. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  She is precluded legally from saying something that could be construed by Pete Hegseth and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=499.15999999999997s)]
*  his legal representatives to be damaging to him. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=503.68s)]
*  And as we know, Pete Hegseth and his lawyers have alleged multiple times to multiple people [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=507.68s)]
*  that the things they have said in the public are themselves defamatory, if not violations [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  of other agreements that he has entered into with them. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  And this matters in the confirmation process because of claims about his relationship with [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  his ex-wives, particularly his second wife, that are things that raise questions about [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  his character. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to put this into context, particularly with respect to Samantha Hegseth's [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=532.1999999999999s)]
*  one and only public statement in regards to that affidavit submitted by her former sister-in-law. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  That's an affidavit in which Samantha Hegseth's former sister-in-law says that based on things [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  that Samantha said to her, as well as things that she observed, she believes not only that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  Pete Hegseth has an alcohol abuse problem, but that he was abusive to Samantha. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  Samantha Hegseth's statement to NBC says, there was no physical abuse during my marriage, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  but she doesn't deny any emotional abuse. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=561.72s)]
*  She doesn't deny that she feared for her safety, which is another allegation that Danielle [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=564.72s)]
*  Hegseth makes in the affidavit. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=568.72s)]
*  She doesn't deny even that she had a code word that she used with friends and family [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=571.72s)]
*  in case she ever needed an escape plan with respect to that fear of Pete Hegseth. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=575.72s)]
*  All she is saying in her public statement is that there was no physical abuse. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=581.72s)]
*  There is not a lot of contradiction between that statement and what Danielle Hegseth is saying. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=585.72s)]
*  She says that this is an allegation of one instance of sexual abuse, and she herself [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=591.72s)]
*  draws a distinction between physical and sexual abuse in her affidavit. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=595.72s)]
*  Briefly, have you heard anything from Capitol Hill tonight? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=599.72s)]
*  I have. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=602.72s)]
*  I've heard from Senator Tim Kaine's office, because Senator Kaine was asked what this [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=603.72s)]
*  means to him. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=607.72s)]
*  He said not only can he understand this language as sort of a disincentive for someone to speak, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=609.72s)]
*  but a spokesperson for the senator commented to me tonight when I asked them, do you think [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=613.72s)]
*  Hegseth was untruthful or misleading in his answers to the question Senator Kaine asked [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=617.24s)]
*  him during his testimony? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=622.24s)]
*  The response on the record attributable to a spokesperson for Senator Tim Kaine is yes, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=624.24s)]
*  he does think that, Rachel. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=628.24s)]
*  That's important given that his vote is slated for tomorrow. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=630.24s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, MSNBC, Leo Correspondent, thank you for this reporting. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=634.24s)]
*  Thanks for helping us get it on the air. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=637.24s)]
*  I know it was a bear to get it sorted tonight, but we've got every i dotted, every t crossed, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=639.24s)]
*  and I really appreciate your work on this. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=644.24s)]
*  Thank you, Brad. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGnZMP6KbzI&t=645.76s)]
