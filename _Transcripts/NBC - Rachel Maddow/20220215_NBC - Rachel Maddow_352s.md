# Wave Of New Candidates Eager To Counter Wave Of Right-Wing Activists In Local Elections
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po)
*  The Mesa County Colorado clerk, who Rachel has talked about before on this show, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=0.0s)]
*  is now running for secretary of state while she is at the very same time under local and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=5.04s)]
*  state investigation for allegedly orchestrating a break-in in order to access critical election [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=11.6s)]
*  equipment. Authorities say the alleged culprits copied hard drives and election data from voting [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=17.52s)]
*  machines with some of that information eventually being published online by the conservative website [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=22.8s)]
*  Gateway Pundit. The New York Times reports that nearly two dozen Republican election deniers [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=28.08s)]
*  are now running for secretary of state across the country to oversee elections. In order to counter [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=33.92s)]
*  this, one group is doing something about it. If you watch the show over the years, you've heard of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=40.72s)]
*  the grassroots organization Run for Something. The group, launched five years ago at the start of the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  Trump administration, works to recruit and help elect first-time candidates to state and local [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=51.84s)]
*  races across the country. And since their launch, they have recruited thousands of people to consider [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=57.28s)]
*  running and elected nearly 650 candidates to local offices across the country. And this year, they [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=62.88s)]
*  are going after election deniers, the ones who want to take control of elections across the country. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=69.92s)]
*  But they're not just focused on the big-name secretary of state races. They are also recruiting [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=75.84s)]
*  and supporting candidates for local election administration roles, so as to box out extremists [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=80.4s)]
*  looking to secure those positions. And here is why. This is from the group's 2020 plan. Quote, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=85.92s)]
*  these are the positions that will determine whether or not democracy survives past 2024. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=92.56s)]
*  Practically, local election administrators quite literally determine how elections are run. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=99.68s)]
*  We're planning for both wide and targeted recruitment, staffing up to run a cohort [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=105.28s)]
*  program specifically for these candidates and investing in support for folks both before and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=109.6s)]
*  after election day to ensure they're ready to do the job and handle the pushback they might experience. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=114.72s)]
*  These positions have the bully pulpit. The people who take it can use it for good and to restore [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=120.8s)]
*  faith and trust in the system and build and bring transparency to the electoral process. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=125.92s)]
*  Or they can use that same bully pulpit to undermine democracy itself. Joining us now is Amanda Litman, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=131.84s)]
*  co-founder and co-executive director of Run for Something. Ms. Litman, thank you for being here [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=139.2s)]
*  tonight. Great to have you. So let's just talk first about how these election conspiracy candidates [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=144.24s)]
*  queue in on time travelers and so forth. The ones who are running for election administration posts, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=152.72s)]
*  how have they shifted your focus? Do you feel like you need to offer your potential candidates [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=158.08s)]
*  extra support or resourcing or training to combat the misinformation that is out there [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  as part of those campaigns? We do. These candidates running for local election administration positions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=169.28s)]
*  need every possible resource. They're going to be going door to door talking to voters who are [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  hearing from an opposition that is admittedly in many places absolutely crazy. So they need to be [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=180.48s)]
*  armed with every possible tool that they can access, whether that's good data, good skills to run strong [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  campaigns, money, support. These races are usually very low and very under the radar. We're going to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=191.76s)]
*  need to bring them up to the level and make sure they have every possible resource. Have you seen [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=198.24s)]
*  greater interest in running in the wake of folks that believe in time travel and lizard people? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=203.44s)]
*  Have you seen greater interest in progressives in terms of running and making sure these folks [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  aren't elected to positions at the school board level, to the secretary of state level, or are [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  people scared of having to combat that kind of, in your words, crazy? So in 2021 we had about 25,000 [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=222.48s)]
*  people sign up to tell us they want to run. So we set that as a goal for 2022. We have already had [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  nearly 20,000 people sign up at runforwhat.net to tell us they want to run for office. And we're [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  barely six weeks into the year. People are fired up about this, especially seeing federal legislation [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  about voting rights fail. They understand that to save democracy, we need to fight for and win for [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=248.8s)]
*  it on the local level. We know that you guys, your group is prioritizing school board elections. Can [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  you talk to us a little bit about why you made that choice? Well, we have seen just as crazy people [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=259.44s)]
*  who are running for local election administration roles run for school boards. This has been the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=265.6s)]
*  priority for the Republican Party and the conservatives for decades. Ralph Reed said 25 or 30 [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=270.0s)]
*  years ago, I'd rather have a thousand school board members than one president. They understand that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=275.68s)]
*  if you control what kids learn, you determine the kind of citizens they grow up to be. And we've seen [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  that over the last two years with protesters and fights over book banning and equity and masks in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=285.36s)]
*  these schools. So we're going to make sure that for the more than 20,000 school board races on the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  ballot this year, half of which are in November, half of which occur at other points throughout the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=294.8s)]
*  year, we are doing everything we can to recruit and support incredible candidates for these races. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=299.04s)]
*  Is there anything that makes it a different crop of candidates than previous years? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=303.84s)]
*  You know, for us, these folks are brave. They see the threats that people are getting. They see how [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  dangerous it can be and they see what the opposition is and they are willing to put their names on the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=314.0s)]
*  ballot anyway. I find it incredibly inspiring to see folks who are going from person who cares to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=319.12s)]
*  candidate to elected official to public servant who's really doing something meaningful for people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=324.64s)]
*  They're inspiring. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6JZGxE5Po&t=329.76s)]
