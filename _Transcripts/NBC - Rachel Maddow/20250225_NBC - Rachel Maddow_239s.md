# Trump taunted with fake video of him kissing Elon Musk's feet over cuts at HUD
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M)
*  I want to show you two very different, totally incredible, expressions of protest in our [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=0.0s)]
*  time. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=6.12s)]
*  The first one depends on nature, on an annual natural event that's called Firefall. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=7.12s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Every February, the way the sunset hits this waterfall at the top of the rock formation [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=14.4s)]
*  called El Capitan in Yosemite National Park, it creates a surreal orange glowing effect, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=19.5s)]
*  almost like the waterfall is made of fire. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=26.6s)]
*  Firefall at Yosemite is a really big tourist attraction, like on a geologic scale. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=30.92s)]
*  Thousands of people camp out to look up at this exact spot where the February sun hits [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=36.08s)]
*  the waterfall in just this way. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=40.64s)]
*  Well, it's now February, and Firefall is on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=42.84s)]
*  And on Saturday this weekend, a group of Yosemite Park employees made it the site of a peaceful [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=46.92s)]
*  but dramatic protest. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  They climbed to the top of this 3,000-foot rock formation, and they hung an American [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=54.5s)]
*  flag upside down, which in U.S. flag code is the symbol of dire distress. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=59.9s)]
*  The park employee who provided the flag told the San Francisco Chronicle the point was [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=67.66s)]
*  to bring attention to what is happening to the parks, by which he means the Trump administration [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=70.98s)]
*  indiscriminately cutting huge numbers of jobs in the national parks, about a thousand so [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=76.42s)]
*  far, enough to raise questions about how well the parks can function, not to mention [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=82.58s)]
*  potentially opening up public lands as widely as they can to drilling and mining. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=86.14s)]
*  Upside down American flag in Yosemite, that's just an incredible expression of protest. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=92.74s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=98.74s)]
*  The second example happened today, all the way across the country at the Department of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=100.86s)]
*  Housing and Urban Development in Washington, D.C., where senior-level managers at HUD have [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=105.58s)]
*  been told to expect half of their staff to be fired. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=110.98s)]
*  Now, I should tell you that what I am about to show you is super gross, really gross. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=114.66000000000001s)]
*  So if you would like to turn away, now is your chance. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=120.78s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=123.86s)]
*  Throughout the D.C. headquarters for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, there are [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=124.86s)]
*  internal TV monitors, the kind that might show you what's for lunch in the cafeteria [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=129.3s)]
*  or whatever, but instead today, when employees showed up for work, the first day everybody [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=134.18s)]
*  was expected to be back in the office full-time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=140.06s)]
*  Instead, on those monitors, they saw this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=141.98000000000002s)]
*  A fakeity fake video of President Trump passionately kissing the feet of Elon Musk with the text, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=146.78s)]
*  Long live the real king, superimposed over it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  What appeared on those internal TVs at HUD today needs to not exist in nature, and thank [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=163.3s)]
*  heavens it does not. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=168.66s)]
*  From our own very helpful internal network guidance on this, quote, our editorial teams [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=170.38s)]
*  indicate this video appears to be AI-generated and fake. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=175.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=180.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=181.38s)]
*  Thank you, Jesus. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=183.54s)]
*  The video does have telltale signs of being fake. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=184.7s)]
*  If you look closely, which I don't recommend, you might notice, for example, that Elon Musk [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=186.9s)]
*  is depicted as having two left feet. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=191.74s)]
*  We ourselves have not seen Mr. Musk's feet, but the ones on screen at HUD today do look [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=196.66s)]
*  like fictional feet. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=201.1s)]
*  NBC News has reached out to the White House for comment. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=204.14s)]
*  We will keep you posted. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=206.18s)]
*  From the tops of the mountains to the bottoms of the president's top donors' fake feet, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=208.3s)]
*  Americans are getting creative in their pushback, creative and unforgettable. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26SNH8iuC-M&t=214.98s)]
