# Putin signaling to trade detained Americans for captured assassins 'like dealing with a drug gang'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4)
*  Whether or not you remember this exact broad daylight kids playground swing set adjacent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=0.0s)]
*  Kremlin assassination in a western capital in 2019, you probably remember some of the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=6.54s)]
*  other things kind of like this, right? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=13.86s)]
*  They kind of start to blend together after there's been a bunch of them. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=15.44s)]
*  The year before the German park mountain bike hitman, there was the Novichok assassination [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=18.86s)]
*  attempt. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=26.38s)]
*  Remember that one? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=27.38s)]
*  The Russian agent assassination attempt by Russian agents in Salisbury in England. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=28.38s)]
*  The Russian agents in that one just missed killing their target and his daughter, but [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=33.019999999999996s)]
*  they did kill a random British citizen who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=36.94s)]
*  Before that, it was Russian agents with the radioactive polonium poisoning plot. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=41.82s)]
*  The fatal radioactive dose of polonium in the teapot. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=47.22s)]
*  That one was in London. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=50.34s)]
*  You might remember just in June this summer, the New York Times reported on another plot [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=52.26s)]
*  by Russian agents to try to assassinate a guy in the United States in Miami. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=56.46s)]
*  That plot was disrupted, but the Justice Department explicitly named the Russian government as [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=63.06s)]
*  directing that operation and the Biden administration kicked out 10 Russian diplomats from this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=68.78s)]
*  country in retaliation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=73.54s)]
*  I mean, there's so many of these things they blend together. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=74.86s)]
*  Apparently, they've got a whole section of the FSB that's just for sending Russian government [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=78.26s)]
*  hit men to other countries all over the world to carry out Kremlin ordered assassinations. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=83.18s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=87.62s)]
*  Because among the many fine and practical accomplishments of the Putin government in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=88.62s)]
*  Russia, one of the things they do all the time is send professional hit men all over [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=91.66000000000001s)]
*  the world to assassinate people in broad daylight, in city parks, in city streets, in department [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=97.18s)]
*  stores and parking lots. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=101.82000000000001s)]
*  And then when their hit men get caught, the Russian government takes hostages. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=104.5s)]
*  They take foreign hostages in Russia, which is why the 2019 Kleiner Tiergarten swing set [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=112.02s)]
*  assassination in Berlin is back in the news today, back in the pages of the Wall Street [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=119.22s)]
*  Journal today, because the latest American hostage, the latest innocent American civilian [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  hostage taken by the Russian government is a Wall Street Journal reporter. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=130.82s)]
*  A young man just 31 years old, his name is Evan Gershkovich. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=134.22s)]
*  And as the Wall Street Journal puts it in their headline now, quote, Putin wants his [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=138.3s)]
*  hit man back, meaning the Kremlin is now signaling that if the United States wants to ever get [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=142.82000000000002s)]
*  Evan Gershkovich, if the United States wants to get this innocent American reporter hostage [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=149.58s)]
*  out of Russia or maybe some other Western hostages, some other American hostages they're [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=155.62s)]
*  holding, maybe U.S. Marine veteran Paul Whelan, if the Kremlin, if the U.S. ever wants any [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=160.38000000000002s)]
*  of those people back, while the Kremlin is now signaling that they want some kind of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=165.3s)]
*  trade that will give them back the swing set mountain bike assassin from Berlin. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=169.58s)]
*  They want their Russian special forces FSB hit man out of prison in Germany, not because [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=175.94s)]
*  he didn't assassinate a guy in broad daylight in a public park in Germany, but because they [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=181.4s)]
*  asked him to do it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=187.02s)]
*  He was just doing his job for the Russian government and now they'd like him back. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=188.18s)]
*  So they'll take American hostages in order to get him back. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=193.86s)]
*  It's not even like dealing with a country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=198.74s)]
*  It's like dealing with a drug gang, right, or like a cartel or some sadistic low-level [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=201.74s)]
*  mob boss, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=207.58s)]
*  This is how they do things. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=209.78s)]
*  All right, we've got the Berlin assassin from 2019 back in the news right now because [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  wants to trade him for the American reporter they took hostage in March. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=218.46s)]
*  Somebody end up with cement shoes here? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=224.94s)]
*  Somebody going to be swimming with the fishes? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=226.78s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=228.5s)]
*  Are we checking each other for switchblades in our in our boots? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=229.5s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=232.78s)]
*  I mean, this is this is international relations. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=233.78s)]
*  This is diplomacy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=236.86s)]
*  This is how you do it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=237.86s)]
*  We've also got Victor Bout back in the news at the same time right now. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=239.18s)]
*  Victor Bout, the Russian international gun runner who's known internationally both for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=243.9s)]
*  his mustache and for his nickname, the Merchant of Death. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  To get him back, Russia took WNBA star Brittany Greiner hostage. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  February of last year held Brittany Greiner in prison in Russia for 10 months. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=258.74s)]
*  They only released her in December in an exchange for Victor Bout being let out of federal prison [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=263.74s)]
*  in the United States and shipped back to Russia. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=268.74s)]
*  Now that their hostage maneuver with that young American woman, that American athlete, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=272.94s)]
*  now that that worked to spring Victor Bout from prison, Victor Bout is apparently now [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=278.62s)]
*  going to go into politics in Russia. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=283.92s)]
*  We learned this this weekend in the New York Times. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=287.62s)]
*  Victor Bout is going to going to be a real star in Russian politics. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=289.54s)]
*  They're going to make him a real asset to Putin's dictatorship, the weapons smuggler [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=292.58s)]
*  to rogue states and terrorist groups. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=296.94s)]
*  Because that's the kind of hero Russia needs. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=300.34s)]
*  It's just like an acute toxicity. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=304.94s)]
*  There are lots of bad governments in the world, right? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=310.02s)]
*  Lots of bad leaders, lots and lots and lots of bad governments. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=313.44s)]
*  But this is like the difference between a scratch and a stabbing, right? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=317.62s)]
*  What Putin is doing is something special in the world, something acutely, deliberately [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  toxic, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=327.28s)]
*  It's not a stomach ache. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=329.7s)]
*  It's food poisoning. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=330.86s)]
*  In Russia, 10 days ago, Putin's government decided to declare that the winner of the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=335.26s)]
*  Nobel Peace Prize, Dmitry Muratov, literally the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=339.58s)]
*  Putin has just declared that he is a foreign agent, making it literally illegal for anyone [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=346.46s)]
*  to work with him in Russia, making it a crime to work with him. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=351.41999999999996s)]
*  What is foreign agent-y about him? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=357.08s)]
*  What is so evil and criminal about him? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=360.5s)]
*  He's a newspaper editor. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=362.8s)]
*  His newspaper has already been chased out of Russia under threat of imprisonment or [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=364.76s)]
*  worse. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=370.12s)]
*  But why wouldn't he? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=372.8s)]
*  Why would a Nobel Peace Prize stop him? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, Putin's on like a kind of a doctor evil high at the moment, still apparently [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=375.64s)]
*  pumped after what appears to have been the plane crash assassination of the warlord he [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=380.36s)]
*  cultivated to force Russian prisoners to fight against their will in Ukraine. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=384.94s)]
*  A man who at the time of his death was under federal criminal indictment in the United [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=390.29999999999995s)]
*  States for his alleged role in helping carry out the Kremlin's attack on our 2016 presidential [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=394.58s)]
*  election to mess with American democracy, to try to make Americans hate and distrust [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=399.34s)]
*  each other more than we already do. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=404.06s)]
*  And not incidentally, to try to get a particularly pro-Putin Republican candidate, Donald Trump, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=406.17999999999995s)]
*  into the U.S. White House. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF5_7eWzOe4&t=411.34s)]
