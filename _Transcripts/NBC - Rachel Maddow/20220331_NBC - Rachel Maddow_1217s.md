# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 30
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo)
*  Well, what everyone seems to agree upon, except the Russians of course, is that Ukraine has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=0.0s)]
*  managed to fight the Russian ground advance to a halt almost everywhere. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=4.94s)]
*  And in some places, Ukrainian forces are regaining territory. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=10.18s)]
*  One of the reasons this Russian failure has so surprised observers and experts is that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=14.36s)]
*  many people assumed that Russia had learned from its previous botched military operations, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=18.88s)]
*  Russia's been in this situation before, less than 30 years ago, when President Boris Yeltsin [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=25.52s)]
*  sent a column of tanks into neighboring Chechnya. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=31.52s)]
*  The aim was to quickly take Chechnya's capital and put down its bid for independence, but [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  it did not go as planned. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=41.28s)]
*  Tonight, Yeltsin is in serious trouble at home and abroad as a result of his clumsy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=43.76s)]
*  and so far disastrous invasion of the breakaway republic of Chechnya. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=50.32s)]
*  NBC's Tom Aspel tonight is in the little mountainous province that will not die. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=54.64s)]
*  The Chechens celebrated their victory against the mighty Russian army with a traditional war dance. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=84.84s)]
*  There is no place more symbolic or more important for the Chechens than their presidential palace. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=90.08s)]
*  If the Russians do get reinforcements, they'll probably try to take it again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=95.08s)]
*  They'll need crack troops, not conscripts, who are seeing battle for the first time. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=99.8s)]
*  Nikolai Sergeyev, 19 years old, was sent from more than a thousand miles away. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=104.48s)]
*  He'd never heard of Grozny before his 200-man company reached the city railway station [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=109.92s)]
*  in the middle of a battle. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=114.64s)]
*  He's one of only three survivors. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=116.16s)]
*  The Chechens blew us to bits, he said. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=118.12s)]
*  We talk now about how much smaller Ukraine is than Russia, but Chechnya was tiny. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=123.08s)]
*  Ukraine has over 40 million people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=129.84s)]
*  Chechnya had just over 1 million, and yet they managed to stop a tank column and wipe [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=132.12s)]
*  out an entire brigade of one of the world's most powerful armies. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=138.16s)]
*  The longtime New York Times foreign correspondent, Carlotta Gall, was in Grozny at the time. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=143.08s)]
*  She says there was, quote, a stunned silence in Russia in the days that followed as the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  leadership took stock of what had happened in the army and the army sent in reinforcements. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=153.58s)]
*  She describes what happened next, quote, the Russian army unleashed a terrifying onslaught [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=159.32s)]
*  of air and artillery strikes on the city. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=164.26s)]
*  A modern European city became a ravaged moonscape. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  I remember how buildings were shorn in half and the contents of people's lives spilled [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=172.12s)]
*  out of their apartments into the open air. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=176.84s)]
*  After three months, Russian forces took the city center and soldiers sat on plastic chairs [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=180.28s)]
*  guarding a wasteland of destroyed buildings, gouged earth, and stricken tree stumps. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=185.72s)]
*  After leveling the place, Russia signed a peace deal with Chechnya, but Russia didn't [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=193.32s)]
*  seem to have gotten much out of the whole deal besides widespread destruction and tens [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  of thousands of deaths. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=202.68s)]
*  The peace deal even seemed to tacitly acknowledge Chechnya's independence, but then Boris [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=204.84s)]
*  Yeltsin tapped Vladimir Putin to be Russia's prime minister, and Putin decided he was going [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=209.64s)]
*  to finish the job. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=216.64s)]
*  The people here are still dazed. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  The surprise attack tore through the central food market. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=221.72s)]
*  The sudden brutal rain of rockets and shrapnel was totally unexpected. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=224.84s)]
*  This home video taken moments after the attack here in the heart of Chechnya, and nearby [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=230.2s)]
*  witnesses say four missiles exploded overhead. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=234.94s)]
*  U.S. officials say they were scuds. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=238.24s)]
*  Within minutes, the dead were everywhere. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=241.16s)]
*  The Chechens claim 120 died, 400 injured. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=242.96s)]
*  Today Moscow says it is not responsible. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=247.4s)]
*  Today Russia is threatening to double its forces in Chechnya to 100,000 strong. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=251.84s)]
*  The assault began Christmas Day. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=262.68s)]
*  The Russians using multiple launch missiles causing widespread damage. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=264.4s)]
*  And now reports they are using fuel air explosives, which literally drop huge balls of fire. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=268.76s)]
*  Today Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin reported to President Boris Yeltsin the war [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=274.12s)]
*  plan is on track. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  The next year Vladimir Putin became Russia's president and he kept at it in Chechnya for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=281.76s)]
*  nine more years. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=287.12s)]
*  By the time Russian forces left for the second time, not only was Chechnya reduced to rubble [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=289.68s)]
*  once again, but Putin had installed his own puppet leader there who has now ruled Chechnya [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  for over 15 years with notorious cruelty. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=300.64s)]
*  He currently has Chechen forces fighting for Russia in Ukraine. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=304.72s)]
*  Now remember yesterday when Russia's chief negotiator at the peace talks in Istanbul [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  said that Russia would take steps to de-escalate military operations around Ukraine's capital? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=314.68s)]
*  Well today Putin's hand-picked despot who controls Chechnya put out this video in which [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=320.92s)]
*  he says that Russia's negotiator was wrong. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=326.56s)]
*  Russia will make no concessions. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=330.68s)]
*  Putin will not stop and Russian forces will be going into Kiev in a few days. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=333.08s)]
*  And look, this guy may not know what he's talking about, but he is a reminder that for [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=339.64s)]
*  Vladimir Putin the lessons of Russia's decade and a half of grinding war in Chechnya may [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=343.96s)]
*  not be to have a better military strategy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=349.84s)]
*  The lesson Putin may have taken is that if you reduce a place to rubble, you get to install [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=352.96s)]
*  your most loyous ruthless henchman to run it, someone who will be your biggest cheerleader [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=357.8s)]
*  in your next invasion. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=363.84000000000003s)]
*  Everyone's suspicion is that Putin may just be using these peace talks to buy time, to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=366.24s)]
*  regroup and launch a new offensive. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=370.56s)]
*  Despite Russian claims that they would de-escalate around Kiev and Chernihiv, this was Chernihiv [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  this morning, a market building destroyed by Russian strikes overnight, eerily similar [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=378.68s)]
*  to that market attack in Grozny 23 years ago, though thankfully there were no reports of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=384.24s)]
*  casualties today. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=389.64000000000004s)]
*  While the Ukrainian leader was soliciting more military aid from President Biden, an [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=392.48s)]
*  all-female delegation of Ukrainian members of parliament was in Washington for meetings [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  with U.S. lawmakers like this one, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=401.04s)]
*  They're in D.C. asking for more sanctions and weaponry like fighter jets to boost Ukraine's [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  defenses. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=409.8s)]
*  Their very presence is a reminder of what's at stake. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  Yesterday, as the Ukrainian delegation asked for that desperately needed aid, an air raid [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=414.48s)]
*  siren alert sounded from one of their cell phones. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=419.76s)]
*  As it blared, one of the Ukrainian lawmakers said, quote, I need you all to hear that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  One of those Ukrainian lawmakers, the member of parliament Yevhenia Kravchuk joins me now [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=428.48s)]
*  from Washington. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=432.5s)]
*  Ms. Kravchuk, thank you for making time to be here with us. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=433.5s)]
*  The last I saw you was on Friday in Warsaw and you were on your way. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=437.0s)]
*  You've been meeting now with those lawmakers you told us about, including the House Speaker [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=441.76s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=445.0s)]
*  What kind of response are you getting? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=446.76s)]
*  You know, when I was watching this piece of TV, I can't, you know, I just need to give [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=448.68s)]
*  this emotion. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=456.0s)]
*  And there was an eight-years-old girl drawing a chalk. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=457.18s)]
*  Well, you know, I remember my daughter, who is eight years old, and, you know, and she [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=461.36s)]
*  is in Ukraine right now waiting for me to come, you know, with some sort of news saying [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  that, you know, America will help us. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=473.40000000000003s)]
*  So that's basically the question that I've been asked from, you know, everyone. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=476.0s)]
*  So we do send our messages about the weapons, about the sanctions, about the financial support. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=481.16s)]
*  And we're really thankful for, for example, we've got the news that from President Biden [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  saying that they're going to be half a billion of dollars sent to Ukraine, to Ukrainian budget. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=494.02000000000004s)]
*  So we, you know, we see we're getting there. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=500.38000000000005s)]
*  But about weapons is still, you know, will be satisfied when we'll have them on the ground. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=503.70000000000005s)]
*  It can't be on the table. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=509.18s)]
*  Let's talk about the negotiations that are underway. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=514.1s)]
*  The ones that have just ended in Istanbul. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=518.78s)]
*  There's a lot of doubt from the people I'm speaking to inside the country that these [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=520.1s)]
*  negotiations are meaningful and that the and that the Russian side on this can be trusted. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=524.0s)]
*  They said they're pulling back from from Kiev and other places, and that has not turned [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=528.86s)]
*  out to be true. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=532.8s)]
*  What's your sense of whether these are meaningful negotiations and whether they should they [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=534.48s)]
*  should continue? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=538.5s)]
*  First, we do not believe Putin because Putin has done, you know, everything before. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=541.5s)]
*  Violating his own words. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=548.2s)]
*  So what we believe in is our army, Ukrainian army and our soldiers. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=549.76s)]
*  So we basically think that we need a victory on the battlefield and then we can drag altogether [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=555.88s)]
*  with civilized world put into the table of negotiations because we do need to negotiate, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=564.16s)]
*  for example, the reparation to restore Ukraine. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=570.62s)]
*  But the winning on the battlefield is essential. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=574.4s)]
*  So that's why we've been asking for this battle jets for this air defense system for artillery [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=577.88s)]
*  for tanks. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=583.6s)]
*  You know, there's a big list sent to Pentagon and we actually asked members of Congress [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=584.6s)]
*  both from House of Representatives and from the Senate to, you know, sort of control how [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=591.16s)]
*  this list is going and how we're getting those weapons. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=597.52s)]
*  One of the things that you said to me in Warsaw that that struck me is that you, like every [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=604.96s)]
*  other Ukrainian I've spoken to, has has decided this will end and that Ukraine will sustain [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=609.86s)]
*  itself. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=616.08s)]
*  And then you want the world to start talking about what happens next. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=617.08s)]
*  You actually said to me, it's going to need something that looks like a Marshall Plan [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=619.52s)]
*  to rebuild Ukraine. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=623.12s)]
*  Are you at the point where you can start to have that conversation with people or is it [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=625.06s)]
*  too early right now? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=628.7s)]
*  Because as you said, Ukraine has to win on the battlefield first. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=629.82s)]
*  We do start this conversation and also in parallel, we're having conversations about [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=635.0s)]
*  International Tribunal for Putin and for, you know, all of these military generals who've [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=640.04s)]
*  been giving the orders to bomb the cities. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=647.2s)]
*  I mean, that will be a separate track as well. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=649.92s)]
*  But yes, we will need a new Marshall Plan for Ukraine. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=654.4s)]
*  And I'm sure that United States will take a leading role in this. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=658.18s)]
*  But hey, there is so much Russian frozen money around the world from Central Bank. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=663.0s)]
*  You know, we should think about the way how to use the to use it to restore Ukraine after [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=669.48s)]
*  the victory. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=675.52s)]
*  But, you know, the first thing what we need, we need to kick out Russians from our country [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=676.52s)]
*  because, you know, there can't be any negotiations when somebody puts a gun to your head. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=682.88s)]
*  Evhenia Kravchuk, thank you for joining us again. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=688.6s)]
*  We appreciate that. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=694.08s)]
*  I understand you are you are you're continuing your travels and your efforts to get the world [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=695.08s)]
*  on your side. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=699.8000000000001s)]
*  You have had a Kravchuk as a member of the Ukrainian Parliament. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Alex Bornyakov. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=704.88s)]
*  He's the Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Bornyakov, thank you for making time to be with us tonight. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=710.28s)]
*  Hi, everyone. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=713.28s)]
*  Pleased to be here. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=714.28s)]
*  I want to start by asking you some very basic things about this. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=715.9599999999999s)]
*  How have you managed to keep the Internet up and running despite all of the Russian [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=719.48s)]
*  attacks? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=723.72s)]
*  Well, you know, I think the reason behind this is because the first place during the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  day one, they supposed to and they have this vision to invade Ukraine in three days. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=731.56s)]
*  So they didn't want to touch any of communication or administrative matters. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=737.76s)]
*  So this gave us some time to regroup and to defend the critical parts of it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=743.12s)]
*  We have a number of services, government authorities that are in charge of this. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  One of them and the major it's like it's called special communication authority that [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=755.2s)]
*  basically take charge for cybersecurity defense and communication inside a country. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=761.1600000000001s)]
*  So after a week or a week or two, we have a number of services that are in charge of [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=766.0s)]
*  two. They realize they're not going to get this so quickly. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=773.2s)]
*  Whole Ukraine and they started to disrupt this infrastructure. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=777.1600000000001s)]
*  But we were ready. So right now, in most of the territory of Ukraine, excluding war zone, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=780.8000000000001s)]
*  of course, the communication is stable and cell reception is fine. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=786.48s)]
*  The ministry for which you work, the Ministry of Digital Transformation was not actually [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=792.1600000000001s)]
*  an agency built for war. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=796.4000000000001s)]
*  It's a bureaucratic agency that is now helping modernize Ukraine. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=798.72s)]
*  How has this transition to becoming a large part of Ukraine's military response been for you? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=802.8s)]
*  Well, it's because we have to act according to the realities. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=809.64s)]
*  And, yeah, indeed, we we completely shifted our focus from what we were doing before the [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=816.4s)]
*  war. And right now, our focus is digital diplomacy or someone called this digital [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=821.68s)]
*  blockade when we really appeal to hundreds and thousands of companies, mostly like tech [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=827.76s)]
*  companies. We also take care of cyber defense of the country and cyber offense. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=833.84s)]
*  And we still maintain government services, which you mentioned before. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=842.08s)]
*  DIA is a government service that was installed on almost 15 million users. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=846.48s)]
*  So this app is very popular in Ukraine. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=853.28s)]
*  So you can get so. But again, there was new features added like you can get government help [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=856.88s)]
*  with one click in your app if you were from war zone. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=863.12s)]
*  You mentioned before this app that alert people. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=867.92s)]
*  And right now, we also added a functionality so you can make your look for applying for [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=872.0s)]
*  your reconstruction of your damaged property and get help for the government to restore your [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  property, which were destroyed by Russian troops. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=887.68s)]
*  I am amazed at this chat bot that you've developed so that civilians anywhere in the country [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=893.1999999999999s)]
*  can report the locations of Russian troops. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=898.16s)]
*  Help us understand how you're able to confirm those reports and how helpful that tip line has been. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=900.56s)]
*  Well, it's a great question, though. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=906.16s)]
*  The thing is, the idea, which is which was installed, installed on 15 million applications, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=907.36s)]
*  has a bank A.D. authorization. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=914.24s)]
*  So it's kind of bulletproof authorization made on a two factor. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=917.52s)]
*  And so it's it's it's very powerful. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=924.0s)]
*  So we use the authorization in this chat bot. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=927.36s)]
*  So we make sure that there is no Russians or spies or infiltrators. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=931.12s)]
*  So being essential part of this chat bot on the first on the first pace. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=937.28s)]
*  Let me ask you about the speculation at the beginning of this war that Russia would launch [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=948.8s)]
*  a large scale cyber attack against Ukraine and perhaps any anyone who helped Ukraine. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=953.68s)]
*  That does not seem to have happened. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  Why do you think that? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=960.96s)]
*  Well, who said they didn't? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=963.44s)]
*  They actually did. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=965.6800000000001s)]
*  And they instantly attacking us with a lot of incident. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=966.88s)]
*  We track a lot of incidents, but it appeared that their cyber offence machine or cyber cyber [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=970.72s)]
*  offence force is not so powerful as it was imagined by some experts before the war. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=979.28s)]
*  So they didn't really penetrate it, penetrate any critical part of our digital infrastructure, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=987.92s)]
*  but they trying they instantly trying. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=995.28s)]
*  Let's talk about the recruitment work that your ministry is doing, either crowdsourcing [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=999.84s)]
*  money for Ukraine's military online and actually recruiting for the military. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1005.68s)]
*  So after two days of war, we realized that National Bank of Ukraine's very limited [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  ability of commercial banks and just regular peer to peer transfers, especially abroad. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1019.28s)]
*  So we decided to use crypto in order to fundraise. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1027.84s)]
*  This is really hectic, but we managed to partner with their private crypto exchange [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1032.48s)]
*  Ukraine, Kulcuna, and they help us to establish the security parameters, all the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  exchange mechanisms. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1047.04s)]
*  So and we announced that we basically ready to get donations and form a Bitcoin, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1049.3600000000001s)]
*  Ethereum, Tether. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1056.0s)]
*  And it was beyond our expectations. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1059.04s)]
*  The community of the world, the crypto world community started to donate millions of dollars. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1060.64s)]
*  So we managed to raise to around 70 million dollars in crypto. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1065.04s)]
*  And this is this is really what helping our army and was really helpful, especially during [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1070.3999999999999s)]
*  the first day of war, where payments and dollars in Europe were not so available like they available [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1076.1599999999999s)]
*  right now. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1084.0s)]
*  It's a fascinating discussion, and we appreciate you having it with us this evening. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1087.36s)]
*  Alex Bornyakov is the Ukrainian deputy minister of digital transformation. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1090.96s)]
*  Mr. Bornyakov, thank you for making time to be with us tonight. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  Late last night, three men said goodbye to fellow crew members on the International Space Station [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1100.4s)]
*  and made their way into a tiny Soyuz capsule for their return to Earth 250 miles below. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1105.6000000000001s)]
*  Earlier today, the three men made it safely back to the ground, plopping down in a big puff of dust [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1111.76s)]
*  in the Kazakhstan desert. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1118.4s)]
*  Inside that capsule were two Russian cosmonauts and one American astronaut, Mark Vande Hei. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1120.24s)]
*  All three men were extracted from the capsule safely, and after some medical testing, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1126.96s)]
*  they went their separate ways, heading back to their home nations. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1131.04s)]
*  Images like these of Americans and Russians and Europeans and others working together and [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1134.64s)]
*  depending on each other are how space exploration is supposed to work. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1138.56s)]
*  250 miles above Earth, national boundaries are supposed to disappear, along with terrestrial [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1144.08s)]
*  politics. Up there, it's about mutual dependence. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1149.44s)]
*  But politics did threaten to intervene earlier this month after the US started imposing [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1153.04s)]
*  sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1157.68s)]
*  The head of Russia's space agency warned that sanctions against Russia could disrupt their [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1160.72s)]
*  ability to keep the ISS up in orbit and also stop supplying rocket engines to two US aerospace [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  suppliers. And Russia still has not signed on to an agreement to extend the life of the space station [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1172.0s)]
*  past 2024. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1177.84s)]
*  And then there's China, which is building its own space station and is strengthening [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1179.84s)]
*  its ties with Russia in space as well as on Earth. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1183.28s)]
*  While war rages over terra firma, low Earth orbit is considered neutral territory. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1187.84s)]
*  For now. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1193.6799999999998s)]
*  But watch this space. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1194.8799999999999s)]
*  Literally. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zFxcrmwOBo&t=1196.6399999999999s)]
