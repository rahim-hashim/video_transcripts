# McCarthy Changes Tune On Cooperation As January 6th Committee Seeks His Testimony
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc)
*  So the day was already not going great for the House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=0.0s)]
*  But then, at four o'clock this afternoon, it got worse when the January 6th investigation [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=5.2s)]
*  posted this letter to Kevin McCarthy himself. It is a letter inviting him to please provide [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=10.88s)]
*  information to the investigation. Quote, Dear Leader McCarthy, we write to request your voluntary [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=16.56s)]
*  cooperation with our investigation on a range of critical topics, including your conversations [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=21.84s)]
*  with President Trump before, during, and after the violent January 6th attack. You have acknowledged [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=26.96s)]
*  speaking directly with the former president while the violence was underway on January 6th. This [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=32.56s)]
*  information bears directly on President Trump's state of mind during the January 6th attack as [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=37.44s)]
*  the violence was underway. The select committee is aware that, notwithstanding the unacceptable [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=41.84s)]
*  violence that day, you nevertheless agreed to support continued objections to the electoral [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=46.8s)]
*  votes from multiple states late in the evening of January 6th and into the morning of January 7th. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=51.44s)]
*  The select committee wishes to question you regarding communications you may have had with [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=57.28s)]
*  President Trump, President Trump's legal team, Representative Jim Jordan, and others at the time [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=60.8s)]
*  on that topic. Congressman Jim Jordan, really. Quote, It appears that you may also have discussed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=68.32s)]
*  with President Trump the potential that he would face a censure resolution, impeachment, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=75.28s)]
*  or removal from office under the 25th amendment. It also appears that you may have identified other [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=80.0s)]
*  possible options for President Trump, including his immediate resignation from office. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=85.12s)]
*  Relatedly, the select committee is concerned about the potential for continued violence after January [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=91.76s)]
*  6th, provoked by President Trump's false claims that the election was stolen. The committee is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=96.4s)]
*  aware of communications among White House staff and President Trump's supporters regarding the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=100.56s)]
*  potential for further violence. For example, and this is new today, Fox News host Laura Ingraham [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=105.04s)]
*  texted White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on January 12th, 2021. Quote, Remarks on camera, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=111.36000000000001s)]
*  discouraging protest at state capitals, especially with weapons, will be well advised given how hot [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=117.76s)]
*  the situation is. Again, that text reportedly from a Fox News host to the White House chief of staff. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=124.56s)]
*  The committee continues, quote, during this same time period, you shared this concern about the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=131.12s)]
*  president's stolen election claims with your local news organization, saying, quote, it's raising [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=135.92s)]
*  the ability for greater violence. The letter then goes on to ask Congressman Kevin McCarthy to meet [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=141.28s)]
*  with the investigators the first week of February. They also quote back to him a statement he made to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=148.56s)]
*  a local news station in California just a couple of weeks ago, indicating in response to a question [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=154.24s)]
*  that he would speak to the investigation. He told that local news source, quote, I have been very [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=159.12s)]
*  public. I wouldn't hide from anything. That said, just tonight, literally just in the past few [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=163.44s)]
*  minutes, it has been handed to me since I started this segment. It has just come out. Kevin McCarthy [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=169.44s)]
*  has just put out this statement saying that he will not cooperate with the January 6th investigation. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=176.4s)]
*  He says in part, quote, as a representative and the leader of the minority party, it is with [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=181.68s)]
*  neither regret nor satisfaction that I have concluded to not participate with this select [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=186.96s)]
*  committee's abuse of power that stains this institution today. So we shall see. The lead of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  the January 6th investigation, Chairman Benny Thompson said today that he actually expects that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=203.28s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy will agree to provide information. He said that they don't anticipate even having to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  subpoena him. Now Kevin McCarthy has come out and said that he is not going to cooperate. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=214.56s)]
*  We shall see how this resolves. The question of whether or not members of Congress, let alone [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=221.68s)]
*  leaders in Congress, can be subpoenaed by this committee appears to be settled as a constitutional [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=225.36s)]
*  matter. It appears to be uncontroversial as a black letter matter in terms of constitutional law. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=230.88s)]
*  The problem is that it's never been done before, and any time a new precedent like that is set, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  a lot of people are reluctant to go there and nobody quite knows how the fight over it will happen. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lry3bjV7TCc&t=240.88s)]
