# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Mar. 2
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU)
*  All right, so big breaking news this evening from the January 6 investigation, and it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=0.0s)]
*  involves this man, John Eastman, an attorney for President Trump, seen here pumping up [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=4.88s)]
*  the crowd at Trump's big January the 6th rally just before the attack on the Capitol. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=9.88s)]
*  The January 6 investigation has described Eastman as a, quote, central player in the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=14.8s)]
*  development of a legal strategy to justify a coup. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=19.6s)]
*  Now Eastman infamously wrote that two memos for President Trump outlining what he described [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=23.88s)]
*  as a legal path for Vice President Mike Pence to toss out electoral votes from several states [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=28.6s)]
*  that Joe Biden had won and thereby handing the 2020 election to Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=33.96s)]
*  Eastman and Trump both repeatedly pressured Mike Pence to follow these plans, to toss [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  out those electoral votes when it came time for him to preside over the certification [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=44.84s)]
*  of the election on January the 6th. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=49.36s)]
*  And of course, Pence, as we know, did not bow to the pressure campaign. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  The January 6 investigation naturally had a lot of questions for John Eastman. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=56.04s)]
*  But when they subpoenaed him, Eastman pled the fifth. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=61.54s)]
*  He asserted his right not to incriminate himself under questioning. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=64.76s)]
*  Politico called it, quote, an extraordinary assertion by someone who worked closely with [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=68.44s)]
*  Trump to attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  Now unable to get his testimony, as you can imagine, the January 6 investigation subpoenaed [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=76.4s)]
*  John Eastman's records. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  More importantly, his emails from his time working with Trump to overturn the election. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=82.6s)]
*  Mr. Eastman has been trying to block the investigation from getting those emails, claiming that he [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  was acting as Donald Trump's attorney and therefore his emails are protected by attorney [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=94.24s)]
*  client privilege. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=99.74s)]
*  Now, here is where things actually get interesting. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=100.74s)]
*  Tonight, the January 6 investigation has filed a motion in court making its case for why [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=103.32s)]
*  those emails are actually not protected by attorney client privilege. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=108.8s)]
*  And what they're saying is that the attorney client privilege is void if what the lawyer [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=113.08s)]
*  and the client are communicating about is doing something illegal or fraudulent. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=118.72s)]
*  Under the law, you and your lawyer can't just simply plan something illegal and then claim [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=124.0s)]
*  attorney client privilege to shield all the evidence of that crime. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=129.28s)]
*  And the January 6 investigation is now saying to the judge tonight, we believe Donald Trump [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=133.48s)]
*  and his lawyer, John Eastman, were engaged in crimes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=138.94s)]
*  Let me read some of it for you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=143.76s)]
*  This is from tonight's filing for the January 6 investigation. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=144.88s)]
*  Evidence and information available to the committee establishes a good faith belief [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=148.48s)]
*  that Mr. Trump and others may have engaged in criminal and or fraudulent acts. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=152.16s)]
*  And that plaintiff's legal assistance was used in furtherance of those activities. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=157.7s)]
*  The president sought to use the vice president to manipulate the results in his favor. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=162.56s)]
*  Had this effort succeeded, the electoral count would have been obstructed, impeded, influenced, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=169.24s)]
*  and at the very least delayed all without any genuine legal justification and based [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=174.0s)]
*  on the false pretense that the election had been stolen. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=179.62s)]
*  There is no genuine question that the president and plaintiff attempted to accomplish this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=183.08s)]
*  specific illegal result. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=188.36s)]
*  The select committee also has a good faith basis for concluding that the president and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=190.2s)]
*  members of his campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States by [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=194.56s)]
*  interfering with the election certification process, disseminating false information about [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=199.48s)]
*  election fraud and pressuring state officials to alter state election results and federal [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  officials to assist in that effort. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=210.32s)]
*  The conspirators also obstructed a lawful government function by pressuring the vice [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=213.12s)]
*  president to violate his duty to count the electoral certificates presented from certain [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=217.68s)]
*  states. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  The apparent objective of these efforts was to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  election and declare Donald Trump the winner. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=229.24s)]
*  In this way, the conspiracy aimed to obstruct and interfere with the proper functioning [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  of the United States government. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=238.16s)]
*  So again, tonight, let's be clear about this. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=240.12s)]
*  The January 6 investigation has gone to court to say that Donald Trump's lawyer can't claim [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=242.08s)]
*  attorney-client privilege for his communications because he and Trump and others on Trump's [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=247.88000000000002s)]
*  campaign were engaged in crimes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=254.56s)]
*  Joining us now is former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Barbara [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=258.52000000000004s)]
*  McQuade. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  Last week, she published what she called a model prosecution memo analyzing actual potential [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  charges against Donald Trump for his scheme to pressure Mike Pence to overturn the election. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=267.5s)]
*  And incredibly, the two crimes that she thought may have been committed are the two crimes [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=272.38s)]
*  the January 6 investigation names in this filing tonight. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=277.94s)]
*  Conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of an official proceeding. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=281.82s)]
*  Barb, it's great to have you with us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=286.06s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=287.82s)]
*  As the person who kind of, you know, I'm using this word here, predicted that these might [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=289.94s)]
*  be the statutes that Trump violated. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=294.34s)]
*  What's your reaction to this filing tonight and how significant is it? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=297.17999999999995s)]
*  Well, I think it's a very significant filing because it's the first time the committee [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=301.09999999999997s)]
*  has said out loud what the crimes may have been and pulled together the evidence of what [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=305.34s)]
*  that crime may have looked like. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=310.9s)]
*  I think that any prosecutor who looked at that evidence in the way I did and the way [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  that the former prosecutors who are leading this investigation for the January 6 committee [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=317.82s)]
*  are doing, it really jumps out as fairly obvious potential crimes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  Now, of course, the details of the evidence matters here. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=326.08s)]
*  But one of the things they do in this filing that I think is so significant is they document [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=329.24s)]
*  all of the evidence that they have that is beginning to come into focus that they've [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=334.0s)]
*  been gathering from all of these sources. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=337.96s)]
*  We know that because of some public statements that Donald Trump was pressuring Mike Pence [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=340.0s)]
*  to refuse to certify the election. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=344.84s)]
*  But I think some of the things that are coming into view are the hard part, which is showing [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=347.53999999999996s)]
*  that Donald Trump knew that it was false to say that he had won the election. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=350.92s)]
*  And they document and list all of that evidence in this filing. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=357.12s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to ask you if you can lay that out for us a little bit. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=360.08s)]
*  The investigation has told the federal court it has a good faith reason to believe Trump, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=363.4s)]
*  Eastman and others have committed federal crimes. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  Explain for us the case they lay out. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=371.12s)]
*  And do you think at this point it is a convincing one? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=372.84s)]
*  I do. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=377.76s)]
*  For either of these crimes, obstruction of an official proceeding or conspiracy to fraud [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=379.36s)]
*  the United States, each has slightly different elements. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=383.88s)]
*  But I think the key factor that has always appeared may be elusive is proving Donald [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=386.64s)]
*  Trump's intent that he knew that what he was saying was fraudulent. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=391.92s)]
*  When he was telling Mike Pence you should change the outcome of the election, that he [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=395.64s)]
*  knew that was based on a lie and based on fraud. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=399.04s)]
*  And so they document all the ways that he knew that this was false. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=401.6s)]
*  Number one, his own cybersecurity chief at the Department of Homeland Security said so [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=405.12s)]
*  publicly. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=409.72s)]
*  William Barr, his attorney general, said so publicly. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=410.72s)]
*  The director of the Office of National Intelligence, John Radcliffe, his appointee, said so publicly. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=413.56s)]
*  Barr's successors at the Justice Department told him repeatedly there was no fraud. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=419.24s)]
*  He had an internal campaign memo for the Trump campaign that concluded there was no fraud. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=423.64s)]
*  And 61 out of 62 judges in all the court cases that were filed across the country found that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=429.36s)]
*  there was no fraud. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  One case that the Trump campaign won was on an unrelated issue relating to affidavit. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=434.88s)]
*  Mounts to suggest that Donald Trump absolutely knew that there was no fraud here. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=441.11999999999995s)]
*  In fact, one judge said there was not a scintilla of evidence that there is fraud. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's like, Aiman, it's like there's an instruction in the juries get about willful [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=450.32s)]
*  blindness. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=454.52s)]
*  You can't turn a blind eye to something when it's highly probable that it's true. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=455.52s)]
*  If someone tells you that the world is round, you can't say the world is flat. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=459.96s)]
*  You can't say that in the face of repeated evidence that it is round. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=464.6s)]
*  If scientists tell you and they show you photos and you continue to persist that the world [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=467.64000000000004s)]
*  is flat, at some point a jury will believe that you're lying. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=471.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=473.8s)]
*  And at the point, I guess the point you're making is that you can't just plead stupidity [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=474.8s)]
*  and ignorance and saying, I didn't know, despite the overwhelming evidence that was presented [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=477.56s)]
*  to you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=481.12s)]
*  I want to ask you about another piece of the January 6th news tonight, because there's [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=482.12s)]
*  a member of the far right oath keepers militia who has just pled guilty to seditious conspiracy [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=484.92s)]
*  the attack on the Capitol, which in of itself is pretty significant. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=491.08s)]
*  What does that mean and how big of a deal is it? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=494.71999999999997s)]

*  not only a use of force to interfere with the government authority, but it requires [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=504.44s)]

*  And so what they argued there in that case, the allegation was that they were using force [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=512.14s)]
*  to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=517.8199999999999s)]

*  I want to ask you about another piece of the January 6th news tonight, because there's [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=550.0200000000001s)]

*  Kursan, as we mentioned, and encircling other key strategic cities like Mariupol, we're [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=622.1999999999999s)]
*  also getting reports from the battlefield of Russian troops abandoning their vehicles [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=626.8199999999999s)]
*  without a fight. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=631.28s)]
*  In fact, the New York Times put it this way. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=632.28s)]
*  They're reporting that some Russian soldiers plagued with poor morale, lack of fuel and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=634.1s)]
*  food have, quote, surrendered en masse or sabotage their own vehicles to avoid fighting. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=637.74s)]
*  Now, those reports appear to confirm pictures and videos posted online by Ukrainians across [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=643.38s)]
*  the country showing abandoned Russian military hardware with reliable battlefield information, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=648.34s)]
*  often hard to come by, as you can imagine, by one of the people that has proved most [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=654.5s)]
*  adept at examining this user generated content and proving context on what we are seeing [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=658.32s)]
*  is Rob Lee. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=663.3s)]
*  He's an expert on Russian defense policy and Russian military hardware. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=664.6999999999999s)]
*  Lee is a former Marine Corps infantry officer who is also a senior fellow at the Foreign [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=668.9799999999999s)]

*  He joins us now. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=677.62s)]
*  Rob, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=678.62s)]
*  So what's your impression after seeing this New York Times report based on U.S. Intel [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=680.0999999999999s)]
*  that entire units of Russian troops are abandoning their vehicles, laying down their weapons [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=685.74s)]
*  rather than fighting in Ukraine? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=690.5799999999999s)]
*  Does that comport with some of the reporting and user generated content you are able to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=692.58s)]
*  see online? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=696.82s)]
*  Yes, it confirms what we're seeing online. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=697.82s)]
*  A lot of the videos, many of the Russian soldiers who were surrendering or being captured, a [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=702.1800000000001s)]
*  common theme is just saying they didn't know they were going to war. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=707.38s)]
*  So they were deployed. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=710.08s)]
*  They thought they were doing a training exercise. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=711.26s)]
*  It's clear many of them were not told they're going to war until maybe a day or two prior. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=713.1800000000001s)]
*  And so it's really bewildering for them. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=717.1400000000001s)]
*  know what the purpose of this war is and maybe they've never seen a task, but they don't [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=719.9s)]
*  know why they're there in so many cases. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=723.74s)]
*  In many cases, the civilian resistance they're seeing is something that's also quite surprising. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=725.98s)]
*  And so I think in many cases, they're being told to move into Ukraine. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=730.6999999999999s)]
*  The planning isn't that clear. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=734.5799999999999s)]
*  And in a lot of cases, we're seeing abandoned vehicles and vehicles that appear to be in [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=736.5s)]
*  working order and yet they're still being abandoned in large numbers, which indicates [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=739.98s)]
*  that this is something that might be deliberate or there are significant morale issues. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=743.8199999999999s)]
*  It's basically confirmed by the New York Times report of what we're seeing from open sources. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=749.74s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen this, but US officials today, they said that Russia has put a large [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=755.0600000000001s)]
*  number of rank and file soldiers on the ground in Ukraine by some estimates, as many as 70 [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=758.74s)]
*  percent of those that were committed along the border. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=764.0600000000001s)]
*  But perhaps with inadequate resources, you know, they are yet to control the space, the [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=766.82s)]
*  airspace over Ukraine entirely. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=772.7800000000001s)]
*  Are you surprised by what we have seen thus far in terms of how Russia is executing this war? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=774.6999999999999s)]
*  Yes, there are a number of surprising aspects. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=783.5s)]
*  One thing that I thought was when Russia started this war, I thought they're going to maximally [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=786.86s)]
*  employ their use of fires, of aviation, of airstrikes, all those things to grade Ukraine's [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=790.3s)]
*  defensive capabilities, to try and knock out the Ukrainian Air Force, to knock out their [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=795.4599999999999s)]
*  air defense systems, all those things I thought they were going to achieve. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=799.3399999999999s)]
*  I thought they're going to use electronic warfare very heavily to knock out communications [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=802.26s)]
*  in Kiev. And we haven't really seen that. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=805.22s)]
*  And it's been quite surprising. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=806.9s)]
*  It appears they're adapting at this point, but it appears that when they went in, that [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=808.46s)]
*  they had overly optimistic goal or idea of what was going to happen. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=812.14s)]
*  I don't think they thought they're going to get this much resistance. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=816.34s)]
*  It includes many of these cities that they've taken so far, moved into, are the more pro, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=818.78s)]
*  it shouldn't be the more pro-Russian areas or the Russian speaking areas. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=823.74s)]
*  And they're still seeing a significant amount of resistance. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=826.5s)]
*  And so it is quite surprising to them of what they're seeing. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=828.62s)]
*  And it's clear that the initial goal was to try to get to Kiev as quickly as possible [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=831.7800000000001s)]
*  with light forces. And they did that aerosol operation and airport outside Kiev on the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=836.26s)]
*  first day. That failed. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=839.98s)]
*  And now they're moving into Plan B. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=841.6600000000001s)]
*  But it's not completely clear to me how they're going to translate military force into [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=843.22s)]
*  achieving long term political goals. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=847.7800000000001s)]
*  It seems as though the political goals they have are unrealistic to be achieved through [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=849.5s)]
*  military force. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=853.46s)]
*  You also probably saw that Russia today announced that 500 of its soldiers have died in [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=854.9399999999999s)]
*  this conflict so far. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=859.18s)]
*  Two Western officials tell NBC News today that it's probably closer to around 6000 [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=861.54s)]
*  Russians that have been killed in Ukraine so far. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=865.58s)]
*  That is a significant number of losses in one week. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=868.7s)]
*  If true, that means more Russian troops have died in Ukraine in seven days than U.S. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=871.54s)]
*  troops did in Afghanistan in 20 years and almost the same number of Russians who died [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=877.9s)]
*  in Chechnya during that war. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=881.46s)]
*  What do you make of those conflicting reports? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=882.7s)]
*  So, you know, even if we accept the Russian figure, right, about 500 KIA and about 1500 [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=886.9000000000001s)]
*  wounded in action, those are unprecedented numbers for the Russian military under Putin's [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=891.7s)]
*  leadership. Right. So in Chechnya, Russia lost more than 3000 soldiers. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=896.5400000000001s)]
*  That was over many, many years. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=900.0600000000001s)]
*  Right. It wasn't under such a confined time period. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=901.58s)]
*  In Georgia, Russia lost fewer than 100 soldiers. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=903.7800000000001s)]
*  And that was over five days. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=906.7800000000001s)]
*  In the Donbass in 2014, 2015, Russia probably lost a couple hundred, two to three [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=908.1400000000001s)]
*  hundred. And then Syria, they've only lost a couple hundred over a long campaign to. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=912.1s)]
*  So even if the 500 K figure is is accurate, that is still substantially more over a short [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=916.38s)]
*  period of time than Russia has suffered at any time. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=922.14s)]
*  These other wars Putin has fought. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=924.78s)]
*  And if we're talking about, you know, 6000, that really is an astounding figure. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=926.1s)]
*  And again, it comes back to it. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=930.22s)]
*  Did Russia expect they would sustain these kind of losses? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=932.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure they did. But if it's on the higher end, that really is significant. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=935.62s)]
*  And one of the big problems and one of the things unique about this war is that when [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=939.54s)]
*  you compare it to the Iraq war, the Bush administration made a yearlong [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=943.7s)]
*  mobilization campaign. They tried to mobilize public support in support of the war. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=948.38s)]
*  Putin didn't do that this time. Right. And they kept denying they were going to war up [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=952.42s)]
*  until a few days prior. And so because the Russian government did not mobilize the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=956.1s)]
*  public, there's a bit of a question of if this war drags on and casualties increase, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=959.86s)]
*  what is the public backlash? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=964.14s)]
*  And I think that's a real question. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=965.98s)]
*  I don't really know, but I think over the next few weeks, with the economic [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=967.34s)]
*  disruptions, that could become a significant factor. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=970.22s)]
*  And I think it's very possible that President Putin will be facing possibly the [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=972.62s)]
*  greatest domestic threat to his time in office in the last 10 years or maybe his [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=977.02s)]
*  entire time he's been in office. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=981.74s)]
*  Rob Lee, former Marine Corps infantry officer and senior fellow at the Foreign [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=984.3s)]
*  Policy Research Institute. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=988.42s)]
*  Thank you so much for your analysis. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=989.74s)]
*  Greatly appreciate it. Learned a lot. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=991.46s)]
*  It seems clear the Russians are now targeting residential areas or they are [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=993.6999999999999s)]
*  shelling indiscriminately. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=998.06s)]
*  Either way, it is civilians that are now caught in the middle. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=999.22s)]
*  This weekend, we heard from a Russian general who said maybe they would create a [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1002.42s)]
*  humanitarian corridor leading from the city. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1006.1s)]
*  And when people heard that here, it just sent chills up their spines. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1008.86s)]
*  It's not just what happened in Grozny in 1994, but also what happened in Syria. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1012.26s)]
*  The Russians bombed and targeted hospitals across Syria. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1016.9399999999999s)]
*  And so the model is there and people here are aware of that. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1020.66s)]
*  And they were kind of waiting for this next phase of the war. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1023.18s)]
*  There was initially in the last week, maybe a thinking that Ukrainian forces and [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1025.4199999999998s)]
*  these civilian defense forces had stood their ground. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1029.02s)]
*  Now, I think we're starting to enter into this period where people are starting to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1031.4199999999998s)]
*  realistically think that the Russians are not stopping. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1034.7s)]
*  They continue to move on these cities and it doesn't seem like they are going to [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1037.22s)]
*  stop or pause or turn around. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1040.98s)]
*  And the shelling is concerning everybody. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1043.02s)]
*  Yeah. And so with that shelling, Cal, Ukrainian refugees are telling you, I [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1044.6599999999999s)]
*  understand that Russians are attacking residential areas. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1048.7s)]
*  Others are reporting that as well. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1051.18s)]
*  We have seen some photos and videos suggesting that. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1052.5s)]
*  How is that changing the situation where you are? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1056.42s)]
*  You said it was giving people chills to hear of a potential humanitarian corridor. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1059.46s)]
*  But what has it meant in terms of the influx of people and the fear that people [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1063.26s)]
*  have as they get to safer parts of the country in Lviv? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1067.26s)]
*  So we're seeing people arrive in this city completely traumatized. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1073.74s)]
*  I mean, I mean, just gripped with fear. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1077.02s)]
*  They've just come from a hellish place where they were dealing with bombs and [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1078.9s)]
*  trying trying to get their families out. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1082.66s)]
*  And then they come here to Lviv, a place that was supposed to be safe. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1084.3s)]
*  We've had five separate air raid sirens go off today throughout the day. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1086.54s)]
*  And so you see people scrambling to these shelters. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1090.06s)]
*  I'm 350 miles from Kiev. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1093.34s)]
*  We have not heard jets at all. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1095.14s)]
*  We haven't been hit once here. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1097.5s)]
*  But people are so traumatized. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1099.3s)]
*  They're so scarred by what they've seen that they go sprinting to those bomb [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1100.74s)]
*  shelters and they have nothing with them. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1103.74s)]
*  Nobody chooses to be a refugee. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1105.82s)]
*  It's a thing that happens to you and happens in an instant. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1107.6599999999999s)]
*  And you have 10 minutes to get whatever you can carry and leave your home. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1109.78s)]
*  And the majority of refugees never go back to their homes. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1112.86s)]
*  They end up raising their families in foreign countries. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1115.1399999999999s)]
*  They end up living their lives in foreign countries. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1117.74s)]
*  And Ukraine is no different. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1121.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, we have a generation that is going to be scarred. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1123.3799999999999s)]
*  You have a million people that have already left the country. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1125.78s)]
*  Most of those folks will never come back. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1127.8999999999999s)]
*  The cities will never be the same. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1129.26s)]
*  And I'm trying to paint a picture here of how Vladimir Putin can destabilize a [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1130.6599999999999s)]
*  country without even really holding on to it. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1134.74s)]
*  If his goal is to destabilize it, make this in a livable place, take out the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1137.42s)]
*  government and replace it, you know, that's still quite possible. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1141.22s)]
*  People here are fleeing for their lives. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1144.38s)]
*  And those who don't want to stay and fight are just trying to get out. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1146.34s)]
*  Military age males between 18 and 60 are now forced to stay and fight. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1149.3s)]
*  And as more and more civilians pick up weapons, civilians become soldiers and [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1153.22s)]
*  soldiers are dying. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1157.06s)]
*  And that's the reality of what's happening here. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1158.3s)]
*  Talk to me a little bit, Cal, about, and you just mentioned about a million have [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1160.26s)]
*  a flood already. A million people have fled already since the conflict began. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1163.9s)]
*  Talk to me about how the authorities are managing that exodus, the flow of people [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1167.0600000000002s)]
*  both on the Ukrainian side and in the neighboring countries from what you've [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1173.0600000000002s)]
*  been able to gather. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1176.1000000000001s)]
*  The Ukrainians are reeling from this. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1179.5400000000002s)]
*  I mean, look, just over a week ago, Ukrainian government was saying that there [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1181.5s)]
*  was likely not going to be an invasion. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1184.66s)]
*  They were disagreeing with Washington's intelligence and there was clearly an [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1186.6200000000001s)]
*  effort on behalf of the government not to spook people. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1190.5400000000002s)]
*  They didn't want to run on the banks. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1192.98s)]
*  They didn't want the refugee crisis to start without a war actually starting. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1194.1s)]
*  And so they didn't put in the preparations that they otherwise would have put in [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1198.06s)]
*  because they didn't want to raise alarm. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1201.3s)]
*  And so here we are a week later. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1203.1s)]
*  These train stations are being overrun. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1204.58s)]
*  People are sleeping in the train stations. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1206.42s)]
*  They're sleeping outside the train stations here in Lviv. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1207.94s)]
*  The city is literally bursting at the seams. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1210.18s)]
*  The restaurants are running out of food. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1211.94s)]
*  It's becoming a more and more difficult situation. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1213.54s)]
*  And then at the border, it's even worse. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1215.5s)]
*  I'm 50 miles from the Polish border and the backup of cars runs about halfway [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1217.46s)]
*  here, more than 20 miles long. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1221.14s)]
*  People are abandoning their cars. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1222.74s)]
*  They're leaving their things behind. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1224.34s)]
*  They're trying to walk to the border. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1225.54s)]
*  Now, when you reach Poland, if you're lucky enough to reach the Polish border, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1226.98s)]
*  Poland has gotten rid of their visa requirements, saying anybody from Ukraine [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1230.6200000000001s)]
*  can remain in Poland for up to three months. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1235.14s)]
*  That's according to the European Union. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1237.38s)]
*  They're talking about extending that, but that's going to be a long [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1239.14s)]
*  bureaucratic process. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1241.98s)]
*  And even still, you're with your family, none of your belongings in Poland. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1242.98s)]
*  It's just, it's becoming a disaster. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1247.82s)]
*  All right. NBC News is Cal Perry live for us from Lviv. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1250.7s)]
*  Cal, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f2tYeUcJU&t=1254.38s)]
