# Maddow on Trump indictment: 'He knew it was wrong when he did it'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE)
*  Well, and it calls out for a Rachel Maddow dramatic reading of a court filing, because [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=0.0s)]
*  I think, Rachel, the kill shot is on page 17, item 36. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  On February 16, 2017, four years before Trump's disclosure of classified information set forth [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=8.28s)]
*  above—and Lawrence read us the verbatim one—the other is this map, a classified [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=14.16s)]
*  map of country B, that Trump tells a PAC representative he should not be showing the map to. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=19.44s)]
*  This is in Jackson's indictment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=25.84s)]
*  This is a quote from Donald Trump from 2017. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=27.5s)]
*  The first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=31.38s)]
*  that's classified? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=35.3s)]
*  How do they do it? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=36.5s)]
*  You know why? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=37.58s)]
*  Because it's an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=38.7s)]
*  But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=41.7s)]
*  ashamed of themselves. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=45.18s)]
*  Really ashamed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=46.94s)]
*  So right there, I mean, Jack Smith killing Trump with his own words, sharing classified [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=47.94s)]
*  information is, let me quote, illegal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=51.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=54.58s)]
*  And he's showing that, and he puts that quote in from 2017 at the end of this portion [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=55.58s)]
*  of the indictment where Trump is shown to be giving the information to a member of the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=60.98s)]
*  press, this classified information that he knows is classified. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  And he does it, I think, not just to neener-neener him, although the neener-neener factor here [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=69.66s)]
*  is high. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=73.7s)]
*  He does it to show that Trump is aware this is illegal. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=74.7s)]
*  Trump is aware that this is not some arcane, you know, picky-une point of law that nobody [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=78.74s)]
*  has to abide by. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=84.48s)]
*  This is Trump saying this is a serious matter, it's a matter of law, and so he knew it was [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=85.7s)]
*  wrong when he did it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=90.64s)]
*  I will also just say, credit to Lawrence's transcript reading there, but the very end [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=92.36s)]
*  of the transcript, I just have to read it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=97.16s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  See, as president, I could have declassified it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Staffer, yeah, ha ha. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  Trump, now I can't, you know. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=104.12s)]
*  But this is still a secret. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=106.36s)]
*  Staffer, yeah, ha ha. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  Now we have a problem. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=110.18s)]
*  Trump, isn't that interesting? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  Yes, you do have a problem, because you just acknowledged this is a classified document [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  that you have shown to a staffer with no security clearance as well as a reporter in the room. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=118.92s)]
*  Yeah, we have a problem. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=123.6s)]
*  Yeah, isn't this interesting? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=125.24s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocpRxw9mcqE&t=126.96s)]
