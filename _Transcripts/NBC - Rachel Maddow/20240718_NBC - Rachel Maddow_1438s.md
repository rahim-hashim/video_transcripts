# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: July 17
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo)
*  Even though the audience, the television audience for this convention thus far has not been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=0.0s)]
*  particularly large by modern standards, one might expect that people will tune in tonight [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=4.74s)]
*  to hear from this new running mate for Donald Trump, who many people will have never heard [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=10.24s)]
*  of before this week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=15.16s)]
*  J.D. Vance is not a widely known public figure. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=16.36s)]
*  He is best known for having written a well-received autobiography, which he started while he was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=19.6s)]
*  at Yale Law School. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=26.64s)]
*  Mr. Vance also served for six months in Iraq as a public affairs unit officer in the Marine [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=29.0s)]
*  Corps. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=33.84s)]
*  Excuse me, served in a public affairs unit in the Marine Corps. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=34.84s)]
*  Yes, even the Marines do have public relations. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=37.36s)]
*  They're great at it, in fact. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=41.04s)]
*  But that is the type of unit, a public affairs unit, that he was in when he was in Iraq. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=42.36s)]
*  After he did his law degree, again, at Yale, he became a protege of a very right-wing billionaire, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=46.7s)]
*  who you might remember from the first Republican national convention that nominated Donald Trump [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=54.16s)]
*  for president. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=58.56s)]
*  He had a primetime speaking slot. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=59.56s)]
*  It was one of the weirder speeches of the 2016 RNC. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=60.88s)]
*  His name is Peter Thiel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=64.36s)]
*  He got J.D. Vance a job at a biotech company in San Francisco after J.D. Vance graduated [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  from law school. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=73.44s)]
*  Peter Thiel got him that job, literally. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  The company's CEO says explicitly that J.D. Vance was hired, quote, as a favor to Peter, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=77.84s)]
*  meaning as a favor to Peter Thiel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=84.36s)]
*  Peter Thiel then got J.D. Vance a second job. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  He directed one of his venture capital companies that they, too, should hire J.D. Vance. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=89.8s)]
*  See, this is why these guys are so against any kind of affirmative action, because clearly [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  they got where they are in this life out of sheer merit, as represented by having your [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=100.22s)]
*  billionaire friend call people and tell them to hire you, even though they're not sure [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=105.0s)]
*  why they're supposed to be hiring you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=109.16s)]
*  After Mr. Vance washed out of the second job that Peter Thiel gave him, Mr. Vance [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=112.16s)]
*  then got another job at a different venture capital firm with another tech billionaire [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  with Steve Case, who founded AOL. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  How did that one work out? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=123.22s)]
*  Mr. Case is on the record saying, quote, he wasn't really working very much. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=124.72s)]
*  Nevertheless, Mr. Vance then was able to go and start another venture capital firm with, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=130.84s)]
*  Surprise, yet more help from Peter Thiel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=138.44s)]
*  Like Mr. Thiel, who has named his companies after things in the Lord of the Rings series [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=142.8s)]
*  of J.R.R. Tolkien books, Lord of the Rings is a sort of favorite cosmos for naming things [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=146.84s)]
*  and cultural references for a lot of far right and alt right figures, both in Europe and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=154.5s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=158.8s)]
*  Peter Thiel names all these things after Tolkien figures and places, like his company Palantir, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=160.0s)]
*  for example, like his mentor, like Peter Thiel, who had given him all his jobs in the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=164.96s)]
*  world. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=169.84s)]
*  Mr. Vance also, when he founded his own venture capital firm with help from Peter Thiel, named [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=170.84s)]
*  it after a Lord of the Rings thing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=175.96s)]
*  He called it Narya, N-A-R-Y-A, which you can remember because it's Aryan, but you move [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=177.56s)]
*  the end of the front. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=182.8s)]
*  Apparently, that word has something to do with elves and rings from the Lord of the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=184.4s)]
*  Rings series. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=188.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=189.36s)]
*  In his new firm, Mr. Vance made one notable investment in one Kentucky company. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=190.64s)]
*  That Kentucky company went public and then promptly went bankrupt. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  So that's the career. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=198.82s)]
*  Does that sound like the rocket fuel trajectory of a person on a fast track to be nominated [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=202.72s)]
*  as the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party of the United States before he turns [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=207.92s)]
*  40? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=212.64s)]
*  No, it does not. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=213.64s)]
*  Writing a memoir and otherwise being Peter Thiel's intern is not usually the way you [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=215.0s)]
*  get to be a vice presidential nominee. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=220.08s)]
*  It's not usually the way you get to be a United States senator either, but it is the way you [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  get to be a U.S. senator if you're J.D. Vance. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=226.54000000000002s)]
*  J.D. Vance's campaign for the U.S. Senate was the first time he ever ran for anything. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=229.72000000000003s)]
*  His campaign was substantially, emphasis on substantially funded by Peter Thiel, who dumped [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=233.96s)]
*  $15 million into a super PAC that supported J.D. Vance's run for Senate. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=241.28s)]
*  That super PAC then further effectively took over the operation of the campaign and ran [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=246.66s)]
*  most of it for Mr. Vance. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=253.3s)]
*  And after Peter Thiel personally took J.D. Vance to meet Donald Trump, literally Peter [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=257.18s)]
*  Thiel physically walked him into the meeting and presented him to Trump. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=263.1s)]
*  That is how Vance got the Trump endorsement for that U.S. Senate seat, which is all you [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  need to win a Republican primary for Ohio Senate in 2022. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=272.84s)]
*  That's how he won the Republican primary. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=279.28s)]
*  He then vastly underperformed other Ohio Republican candidates on the general election ballot [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=280.97999999999996s)]
*  in 2022, but he did win, which is how he got into the United States Senate a grand total [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=286.4s)]
*  of a year and a half ago. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=293.2s)]
*  And that's how he got to be the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party right now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=296.41999999999996s)]
*  As internships go, that's a really good internship. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=302.1s)]
*  The choice of J.D. Vance to be Donald Trump's running mate is reportedly a decision that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=306.58000000000004s)]
*  was only made at the very last minute, like the day before it was announced. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=311.56s)]
*  You do not choose a person like Mr. Vance because you think you need help winning the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=315.68s)]
*  election. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=320.16s)]
*  When they chose J.D. Vance, they did not think they needed any help winning this next election. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=322.32000000000005s)]
*  If you're trying to make up for some soft spots, some weaknesses in the Republican Party's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=328.54s)]
*  electoral prospects, you do not, for example, choose a vice presidential running mate who [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  is on the record on tape taking this position. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=337.8s)]
*  I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=342.36s)]
*  I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=345.6s)]
*  2022 podcast interview first on Earth by CNN Today, in which J.D. Vance says, I certainly [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=349.76s)]
*  would like abortion to be illegal nationally. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=356.32s)]
*  Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, whatever you think about his politics and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=362.34s)]
*  his political instincts, he's been very open about the fact that he sees the Republican [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=365.62s)]
*  Party's strong stance against abortion, particularly a strong stance for a national abortion ban [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=369.56s)]
*  as an electoral loser. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=376.42s)]
*  Even though Mr. Trump is the one who orchestrated the overturning of Roe vs. Wade and therefore [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=378.8s)]
*  the Republican abortion bans all over the country, Trump has admitted that strongly [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=383.66s)]
*  restrictive stances on abortion, particularly a nationally restrictive stance on abortion, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  will cost the Republicans elections they could otherwise win. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=393.42s)]
*  So then why do you pick J.D. Vance to be a running mate? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=397.96000000000004s)]
*  If you are Donald Trump and you pick a running mate and you're looking to pick a running [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=400.68s)]
*  mate to help your electoral prospects because you're worried about your chances of winning [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=404.44000000000005s)]
*  would never pick Mr. I would certainly like abortion to be illegal nationally. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=409.14s)]
*  You would never pick a national abortion ban guy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=414.76s)]
*  You would also not pick a guy who says we're in a quote late Republican period in this [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=419.62s)]
*  country and he doesn't mean capital R Republican. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=424.9s)]
*  He means small R Republican, meaning we are at the end of being a Republic. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=427.62s)]
*  J.D. Vance quoting there, a far right internet personality and blogger who famously advocates [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=432.9s)]
*  openly for the United States to become a monarchy or an outright dictatorship who has called [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=438.14000000000004s)]
*  for abolishing the U.S. government, the U.S. system of government being abolished so we [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=443.46000000000004s)]
*  can instead be ruled by a Caesar figure. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=447.98s)]
*  That is who J.D. Vance has been citing when he talks about us being in a late Republican [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=451.66s)]
*  period as a country. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=456.96000000000004s)]
*  That's what he thinks about where we are as a country and where we should go as a country. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=458.86s)]
*  You do not pick a man like that if you are worried about your electoral prospects. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=464.34s)]
*  The man who created J.D. Vance as a political figure out of whole cloth and gave him all [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=469.78s)]
*  his jobs and also his seat in the U.S. Senate and also his introduction to Trump. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=474.26s)]
*  He says he does not believe freedom is compatible with democracy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=479.21999999999997s)]
*  He wants freedom so that means he does not want democracy. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=483.82s)]
*  If you are Donald Trump and the Republican Party and you are worried about your ability [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=487.23999999999995s)]
*  to win this election in November, you would not pick J.D. Vance as your vice presidential [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=491.46s)]
*  candidate. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=497.58s)]
*  You can only pick a candidate out there as J.D. Vance if you are really thoroughly quite [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=499.08s)]
*  sure that you are going to win no matter what kind of craziness you put on the ticket and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=504.92s)]
*  what you are going to bring into the White House with you. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=510.58s)]
*  J.D. Vance is not the guy you pick to win over suburban women or whatever. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=513.74s)]
*  He is not the persuade the undecided guy. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=518.38s)]
*  J.D. Vance is the guy you bring in to change the American system of government into whatever [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=521.74s)]
*  it is you think comes after us being a republic. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=526.3s)]
*  And you only do that because you already think you have the election in the bag. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=531.9399999999999s)]
*  What is coming together on both sides of the political spectrum right now is that Republicans [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=537.22s)]
*  who are thrilled to have it in the bag think they have it in the bag. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=543.5s)]
*  And that is why tonight is it Nikki Haley giving her acceptance speech. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=549.9399999999999s)]
*  It is not even Tim Scott or Marco Rubio. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=553.34s)]
*  It is national abortion ban end of the republic J.D. Vance who is giving the speech tonight. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=556.22s)]
*  On the Democratic side, this very serious reported turn related to President Biden's [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=563.1s)]
*  prospects of staying at the top of the ticket in this race. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=568.06s)]
*  He's reported visits to the president from the top Democrats in Congress. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=571.06s)]
*  What is the reporting about this? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=577.7399999999999s)]
*  They're not just going to him and expressing their opinion. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=578.7399999999999s)]
*  They're going to him and they're bringing him the polling. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=580.78s)]
*  And it is not about the Republicans hopes and expectations that they have it in the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=584.42s)]
*  bag. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=588.38s)]
*  It is about the Democrats fear that the Republicans might be right and that therefore a radical [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=589.38s)]
*  be necessary to avert what Democrats fear is an otherwise inevitable course. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=596.66s)]
*  It is J.D. Vance night at the Republican National Convention. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=604.42s)]
*  And to have that happening at the same time that this reporting is now surfacing about [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=608.34s)]
*  President Biden is as serious as a heart attack on both sides. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=611.98s)]
*  While we have been talking, we have a little bit of new information. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=616.34s)]
*  We have a response from the White House. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=617.9399999999999s)]
*  The president is from White House spokesperson. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=621.6999999999999s)]
*  The president told both leaders, meaning Schumer and Jeffries, he is the nominee of the party. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=623.5999999999999s)]
*  He plans to win and looks forward to working with both of them to pass his 100 days agenda [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  to help working families. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  So this is obviously the top line response here is no, I'm not going anywhere. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=635.88s)]
*  But this also, I think implicitly, I may be a little ahead over my skis here, but I think [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=640.64s)]
*  this implicitly confirms that Schumer and Jeffries did go to President Biden and say [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  we're going to lose with you at the top of the ticket and therefore you need to decide [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=651.96s)]
*  if those are if you want that to be your legacy. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=655.48s)]
*  Well, unless Schumer and Jeffries deny that that's what they said, even though we don't [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=658.36s)]
*  have details and neither of them have issued something which Nicole and I have written [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=663.36s)]
*  a lot of statements. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=667.4s)]
*  We've been a part of a lot of non-denial denials. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=668.4s)]
*  So if that's not true, they should come out and say it's not true. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=671.0s)]
*  I just want to echo something Nicole said, because I think a lot of Democrats have been [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=674.4399999999999s)]
*  a great deal of attack online and otherwise. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=679.0400000000001s)]
*  And the reason that people are having this conversation is because of the threat of Donald [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=682.0400000000001s)]
*  Trump and now J.D. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=687.8000000000001s)]
*  Vance, who will read the Project 2025 plan and be a more effective implementer. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=689.08s)]
*  It's not because they don't like Joe Biden. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=694.32s)]
*  It's not because they don't think he was a great president. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=696.12s)]
*  It's because they're scared that they could take over and what they would do to our country. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=698.2800000000001s)]
*  That's why people are having the conversation. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=703.1600000000001s)]
*  But in terms of what we know and what we don't know, which is always important, too, I will [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=705.04s)]
*  say that contextually, having worked for Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer and Huckin Jeffries are [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=709.44s)]
*  people that are obviously litters in the Democratic Party. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=716.44s)]
*  They're not people he has close personal relationships with, as close as he has with, say, Jim Clyburn [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=719.12s)]
*  or close as he has with Nancy Pelosi. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=725.36s)]
*  There have been reports and again, we're all pasting together reports and talking to a [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=727.72s)]
*  lot of people about Pelosi's behind the scenes work. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=730.72s)]
*  We don't know much more about that. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=734.8800000000001s)]
*  Obviously, I think it's hard to believe that Adam Schiff would have done what he did without [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=736.36s)]
*  her knowing about it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=740.44s)]
*  But a spokesperson for her said it was news to her. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=741.44s)]
*  Again, these are just things we know right now. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=743.6400000000001s)]
*  The other things we don't know is the impact on money. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=746.0400000000001s)]
*  If the money dries up, that's obviously a huge factor. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=748.12s)]
*  But I think the other last thing I'll just say about what to know about Joe Biden, because [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=751.5600000000001s)]
*  it's what's the reality here we're watching and also how he operates as a human is that [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=755.48s)]
*  he has felt underestimated always. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=760.32s)]
*  It's his superpower. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=763.08s)]
*  It's his superpower. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=764.08s)]
*  It always has been. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=765.08s)]
*  It's his superpower. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=766.08s)]
*  He feels that people never thought he could win in 2020 and he didn't. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=767.08s)]
*  These are entirely different circumstances. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=769.96s)]
*  But for anyone who's thinking, well, the leaders of the Democratic Party are telling him he [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=772.4000000000001s)]
*  should step out, it's over in a matter of hours, I just wouldn't make a bet on that. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=775.64s)]
*  What I would say is that what you reported in very well said matches what I am hearing [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  from. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=787.08s)]
*  I feel like I at this point might have talked to every single member of the Congressional [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=788.08s)]
*  Black Caucus in the last 24 to 48 hours. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=792.48s)]
*  It matches what I am hearing not just from them, but from some of the people whose job [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=796.4399999999999s)]
*  it will be to turn out votes. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=801.28s)]
*  There are people who actually do this. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=803.04s)]
*  They are people who specialize in turning out, particularly votes in places like Fulton [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=805.3199999999999s)]
*  County, places like Detroit, places like Milwaukee that Democrats will have to win and win big [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=809.72s)]
*  and get big turnout in in order to win the election. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  What I am hearing and the anger that I'm hearing that's coming from them is that to the point [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=820.76s)]
*  that you are making, given the stakes and the stakes being democracy itself, the stakes [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=827.24s)]
*  being Project 2025, the stakes being a Trump presidency, which I think everyone agrees [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=833.0s)]
*  African-Americans would be first in line to suffer. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=838.72s)]
*  And so they understand the stakes that there is a sense among the people that I have spoken [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  to, including some senior members of that caucus, that given that there is a sense that [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=847.72s)]
*  there is gamesmanship going on inside of this effort to remove President Biden from the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=853.2s)]
*  ticket and that that gamesmanship is heavily geared toward also pushing aside Kamala Harris, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=860.36s)]
*  Vice President Harris. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=867.0s)]
*  And there is a sense that there is a lot of pressure coming from there. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=868.6s)]
*  Some people are just calling it California at this point, whether it's donors or whether [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=872.6s)]
*  it is members, whether it is whoever. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=876.72s)]
*  This sense of huge pressure for the CBC, which is locked arms with President Biden. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=879.8000000000001s)]
*  I think we can all agree on that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=884.12s)]
*  They have been unwavering. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=885.6800000000001s)]
*  They are sticking with him. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=887.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, Claire McCaskill will tell you to the very end there with him that the huge [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=889.28s)]
*  pressure is coming without regard to the vice president and that there is this what they [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=893.24s)]
*  perceive is a push for an open convention and that people are taking the risk of playing [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=899.08s)]
*  games with a 2024 crisis and that the gamesmanship in trying to maneuver people who may want to [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=905.64s)]
*  run in 20 28 and maneuver them in now is seen as undercutting the whole project when the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=912.56s)]
*  project is beating Trump. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=919.2399999999999s)]
*  What a lot of folks are telling me is that they see gamesmanship to try to set aside [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=921.3199999999999s)]
*  the person who would be next in line in 20 28, meaning the vice president, and that they [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=925.4799999999999s)]
*  will. And I'll just say my last thing is that what I will tell you is just based on the [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=931.0400000000001s)]
*  many dozens of conversations. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=935.64s)]
*  I feel like I haven't been off the phone and I am exhausted by it. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=937.5600000000001s)]
*  I can attest to the fact that Joy was literally on the phone until the second the camera turned [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=940.4000000000001s)]
*  on. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=944.6s)]
*  I was literally still responding to that. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=945.6s)]
*  You have that little strap on your phone. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=946.6s)]
*  I thought you had a landline. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=947.6s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, we brought in a landline. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=948.6s)]
*  It's my tether. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=949.6s)]
*  I literally wear the phone around my neck because I always lose my phone. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=950.6s)]
*  And if I don't literally have it hanging on my neck. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=955.72s)]
*  I thought you were like on a hotline to Moscow. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=957.72s)]
*  I was like, Jason, Mark, Anthony Reed, my wonderful husband, finally realized that I [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=960.4s)]
*  will never stop asking where my phone is until I literally can wear it like an ornament. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=964.7199999999999s)]
*  It's a necklace. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=969.1999999999999s)]
*  This is when you have a good partner in life. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  So this is the tether. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=971.9599999999999s)]
*  But yes, and I was literally listening to you and responding. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=972.9599999999999s)]
*  And that is the sense that that people fear that president vice president Harris will [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=976.4799999999999s)]
*  be moved aside in this process. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=982.5999999999999s)]
*  And the CBC will not move Hakeem Jeffries is an exception, because obviously he represents [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=984.68s)]
*  the whole caucus. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=989.68s)]
*  They go nowhere as long as they think that she's in jeopardy. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=990.68s)]
*  OK, but what if Vice President Harris isn't in jeopardy? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=992.92s)]
*  Yeah. And what if the what if the move what if the move relates to President Biden, but [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=996.7199999999999s)]
*  is about elevating President Harris's totally different conversation? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1003.0s)]
*  And I had a very senior member of the CBC say that to me almost verbatim that if this [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1006.1999999999999s)]
*  was a conversation, they would obviously all support her. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1010.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, she's a member. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1014.3599999999999s)]
*  She was a member of the CBC when she was in the United States Senate. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1015.28s)]
*  They adore her. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1018.16s)]
*  They love him. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1019.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, let's just be I think and I think you said it, maybe President Biden is beloved [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1019.8399999999999s)]
*  in the party. Like that is just very clear. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1024.2s)]
*  Even the people who are asking him to move aside, they love the guy and they've been [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1025.92s)]
*  hugely successful as Democrats. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1029.28s)]
*  All his political rivals love him. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1031.1599999999999s)]
*  They love him. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1032.84s)]
*  Everybody who's ever fought with some Republicans who won't admit it. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1033.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1035.56s)]
*  Yeah. And so I think that is is there is a sense don't play this game with this important [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1039.28s)]
*  issue. And I would just say two sentences. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1044.04s)]
*  Everything you just said can be true. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1045.72s)]
*  And the closer you get to the convention, the more that logistically the only off ramp [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1048.0s)]
*  would be the vice president, because it wouldn't have time for an open convention. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1052.48s)]
*  You wouldn't logistically and financially legally be able to do much with the campaign [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1057.6000000000001s)]
*  coffers unless they were part of the Biden Harris ticket. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1061.0s)]
*  So what you described could be a now thing. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1063.64s)]
*  We don't know, as Rachel emphasized, where this reporting goes. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1065.8400000000001s)]
*  But if this is still being discussed two weeks from now, it starts to narrow from only [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1068.0800000000002s)]
*  Biden, which is what he's reiterated tonight, or perhaps his running mate who could take [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1073.3999999999999s)]
*  over the campaign infrastructure and financing, not starting from scratch in late August. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1077.0s)]
*  The idea of they keep telling me we have to take a break. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1082.36s)]
*  I'm sorry to the control room. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1084.76s)]
*  I will pay personally or whatever commercial. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1088.56s)]
*  I'm very sorry. I just have to finish this conversation. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1094.08s)]
*  Forgive me. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1096.7199999999998s)]
*  I will say that I have been I don't do a lot of this. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1098.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm not like a person who has tons and tons of live sources in politics because I don't [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1102.32s)]
*  like making I don't like being friends with people who I cover. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1106.52s)]
*  So I don't like people having my phone number. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1109.24s)]
*  What you like people, it makes it makes it hard to cover them with the great you need. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1112.36s)]
*  I'm just too like I'm too suburban. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1116.28s)]
*  I can't do it. So I don't do this a lot. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1117.84s)]
*  But this is an exception. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1120.2s)]
*  I'm having one of these moments where I, too, am talking and texting with senators and members [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1121.28s)]
*  of Congress all day. And I have to say, just reacting to what you're hearing, Joy, what I [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1125.2s)]
*  am hearing and maybe we're talking to some of the same people, I don't know. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1130.1599999999999s)]
*  But if Vice President Harris were going to be the choice of the Democratic Party, if [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1132.9599999999998s)]
*  President Biden decided, you know what, for whatever reason and on whatever terms, I'm [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1137.8799999999999s)]
*  going to pass the torch, I'm going to be a transaction transitional leader now. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1143.08s)]
*  Yeah. And it was going to go to Vice President Harris. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1146.7199999999998s)]
*  There would definitely be a lot of work to do to make sure that Vice President Harris [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1149.04s)]
*  was strongly positioned to beat Donald Trump in November. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1152.84s)]
*  But it would then be a normal Democratic work product, project to get her to try to [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  win. There wouldn't be this existential thing going on. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1163.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And I know we're in trouble as long as we're already in trouble. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1166.6799999999998s)]
*  I'll add my reporting. It was described to me today as dynamic, not static, because Vice [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1169.24s)]
*  President Kamala Harris's political strength is is a moving and ascending part of the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1174.36s)]
*  story as well. Yeah. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1179.36s)]
*  And there was a sense two weeks ago that there was a question mark around her electability. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1180.6399999999999s)]
*  There was a report last week that there's a poll in the field by the president's own [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1186.3999999999999s)]
*  polling allies testing that her political strength without any ads, without any effort [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1190.76s)]
*  behind it is very impressive. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1196.4799999999998s)]
*  A lot of political people in both parties would love to design a campaign around Vice [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1199.12s)]
*  President Kamala Harris. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1204.6s)]
*  She I've been a lot of her speeches have been happening in my hours. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1205.6399999999999s)]
*  I've been taking them live. She and I've said this, but she's electric on the campaign [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1208.52s)]
*  trial. And he picked her and he gave an unbelievable speech yesterday. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1212.28s)]
*  And his first line was due to black job is a good life. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1216.24s)]
*  Black jobs. And I you know, whatever he decides, it's a fantastic argument to take to the [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1219.12s)]
*  country. It's a phenomenal contrast with Donald Trump. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1225.4399999999998s)]
*  And I guess the other the other side to what you sort of laid on the table, which is so [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1228.28s)]
*  which is so sobering, is there so much baseball left to play? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1233.4399999999998s)]
*  It's like the second inning of one of seven 18 games and 18 innings is the longest game [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1238.6799999999998s)]
*  ever played. I mean, there's so much left and there's the Democrats who I think are all [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1244.12s)]
*  acting in good faith. They don't need any advice from me. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1248.48s)]
*  But the only thing I would say is there's no room for despair. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1250.6s)]
*  There's a lot of time. There's she's fantastic. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1253.3999999999999s)]
*  He's beloved and everything will probably be OK. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1256.28s)]
*  God bless you. I know we're already in trouble. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1260.12s)]
*  I want to say one more thing. I also think that the president will be influenced by seeing [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1262.8s)]
*  her own path to victory. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1268.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, he this is obviously a decision he has to make. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1271.0s)]
*  It's frustrating people on many levels. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1274.44s)]
*  People are angry. They're upset. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1276.3200000000002s)]
*  They're mad. But he cares deeply about the Democratic Party. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1277.8400000000001s)]
*  He cares deeply about the Senate winning, about the House being in Democratic control. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1281.52s)]
*  And if he can see a path for her to victory, I have no doubt that would be influential [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1286.76s)]
*  for him, too. And while he picked her, I did think what he said about her the last [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1292.0s)]
*  couple of days is true and also significant. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1297.48s)]
*  And people should hear that. But that's another piece. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1301.16s)]
*  But I will give a one piece of advice to the Democrats out there. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1303.8s)]
*  People who are supporters of her don't know where this is going to end. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1307.28s)]
*  Far too many people are in stories saying don't take this away from her, which, by the [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1309.96s)]
*  way, is incredibly defensive about someone who's an electric performer on the campaign [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1314.52s)]
*  trail who speaks about abortion rights in a completely compelling way. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1319.48s)]
*  There's no reason to be defensive. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1323.64s)]
*  Whatever happens, she's a powerful, amazing candidate who'd be a great candidate and a [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1325.1599999999999s)]
*  great president. Period. That's what people should be saying. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1330.04s)]
*  It's way too defensive of a conversation. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1332.32s)]
*  The only person makes the decision is Joe Biden. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1334.36s)]
*  Yeah. But there's no reason to disparage her being that only conversation being about [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1335.9599999999998s)]
*  her being passed over. And by the way, I think we're going to have to send a Venmo to [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1339.8s)]
*  MSNBC to pay for all this. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1342.76s)]
*  I did have someone say to me, which I thought was a quite compelling argument, who [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1347.56s)]
*  obviously is a big supporter of hers. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1351.3999999999999s)]
*  Imagine the prospect of a former sex crimes prosecutor prosecuting a 34-account [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1353.12s)]
*  felon who's also been an adjudicated sexual assaulter. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1358.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think for a lot of people that just the idea of just watching that match happen [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1362.1999999999998s)]
*  is kind of giving people a little bit of the feels, excitement. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1366.6399999999999s)]
*  I will also say two things to say. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1369.1999999999998s)]
*  One is that there was a poll out today, a poll of African-American women showing a 31 [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1370.8s)]
*  point drop in support from 2020 to 2024 in terms of plans to vote for President [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1375.92s)]
*  Biden. Vice President Harris, turn that around. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1382.48s)]
*  And if you think you can Democrats can win the presidency with a 30 point drop in the [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1387.44s)]
*  black female vote, there's a real problem at hand. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1391.48s)]
*  And if Vice President Harris has the support of President Biden and the support of the [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1394.72s)]
*  camp, the support of the party broadly and can get there procedurally, I think there [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1398.64s)]
*  isn't a brighter path in November than the path that goes through her. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1404.8s)]
*  And we shall see. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1409.56s)]
*  The other thing I have to tell you is that we killed a break. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1412.12s)]
*  Hey there, MSNBC fans, I'm Luke Russert. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blgsat7SBuo&t=1416.04s)]
