Video Description: Perhaps in the hope of competing with some of the acclaim President Joe Biden received for showing solidarity with striking UAW members, Donald Trump staged a rally with fake auto worker union members, only to be exposed when local reporters talked to attendees who were not union members or not even auto workers. Rachel Maddow reports on new campaign finance filings that show Trump paid $20,000 to the nonunion auto parts plant he used to stage the event.

# Trump paid $20,000 to rent plant for fake union auto worker event: filing
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs)
*  One of the Republican candidates decided that he would take a different approach than all the others, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=0.0s)]
*  perhaps sensing that Joe Biden was sort of meeting the moment here in a way that Republicans and Fox News weren't. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=6.0s)]
*  You know, recognizing that Biden was siding with these autoworkers and the country was with him and with them on this, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  one of the Republican candidates did try to do something different. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=19.2s)]
*  The day after Biden ended up on the picket line in Michigan, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=23.119999999999997s)]
*  this one Republican candidate decided not to go to that Republican presidential candidates debate. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=25.599999999999998s)]
*  He skipped it and instead he himself went to Michigan. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=33.12s)]
*  To go try to do basically what Biden did, to go show up and be seen with the union autoworkers in Michigan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=39.08s)]
*  Kind of. Whereupon he promptly stepped on a rake. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=48.08s)]
*  Trying to make it look like he was supporting these union autoworkers who were out on strike, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=52.48s)]
*  who the whole country was rallying in support of, he instead went to a non-union auto parts facility. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=56.64s)]
*  And while his campaign tried to convince people to say that he was there speaking to striking autoworkers, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=62.56s)]
*  or at least he was speaking to autoworkers, the problem was that real reporters actually went to the event [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=68.48s)]
*  and they realized quickly that this was a facility that doesn't have anybody in a union. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=74.84s)]
*  And then the reporters did what reporters do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=79.12s)]
*  They talked to the people who were physically there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  And so this was the Detroit News the next day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=84.56s)]
*  Quote, one individual in the crowd who held a sign that said union members for Trump, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=87.28s)]
*  acknowledged to a Detroit News reporter that she was not a union member. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  Another person with a sign that read autoworkers for Trump, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=98.4s)]
*  when asked for an interview said that he wasn't an autoworker. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=102.28s)]
*  Neither person provided their names. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=107.28s)]
*  This was very embarrassing, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=111.39999999999999s)]
*  He's trying to look like he was supporting the union, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=113.0s)]
*  but he's at a non-union facility that he filled with people who were given signs [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=116.24s)]
*  and effectively told to pretend to be union workers or even to pretend to be autoworkers when they were no such thing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  He did a fake event. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  The whole thing was fake. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=131.72s)]
*  And then it was in the Detroit press the next day that it was fake. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=132.95999999999998s)]
*  This you skipped the debate for? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=136.56s)]
*  It was so embarrassing at the time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=139.56s)]
*  And now, as of right now, there are receipts, literal receipts, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  the campaign finance filings that just came out for all the various campaigns. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=147.32s)]
*  Reporter Jonathan Oosting at Bridge Michigan dug in and found that on that day in September, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=151.68s)]
*  the Trump campaign indeed paid a $20,000 rental fee to pay to rent that auto parts plant, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  which was not a union facility. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  So he could pretend it was full of union autoworkers who supported him when it was actually just full of randos holding signs that said that's who they were, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=168.48s)]
*  even though that's not who they were. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  It's it's it's just an amazing thing. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=180.6s)]
*  I mean, you think of things that ended previous presidential campaigns, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=183.0s)]
*  Howard Dean was too close to a microphone when he shouted with excitement after doing pretty well in the Iowa caucuses. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=186.16s)]
*  Your campaign must end. You were too close to the microphone. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=192.48s)]
*  Gerald Ford got lost in the middle of a sentence about Eastern Europe in a debate once. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=195.72s)]
*  Poppy Bush said, read my lips before he said no new taxes, which was like uncharacteristically memorable phrasing from him. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=200.2s)]
*  And so people actually remembered it, which turned out to be really bad for him when the no new taxes thing didn't really work out. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=206.68s)]
*  I mean, campaigns have been laid low by some dumb and small stuff. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=212.56s)]
*  But here's a candidate faking a union event with fake union members and fake autoworkers who were given signs by the campaign to falsely identify themselves in the hopes that no one would check. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  And then they got caught. And it's like, what else you got? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=230.36s)]
*  Did he ever wear a tan suit? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJJF8tuKCRs&t=234.52s)]
