# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: May 9
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc)
*  This was today in Russia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=0.0s)]
*  This happened on at least three different major TV providers in Russia today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=4.1s)]
*  The grid looks at first like the normal rundown of channels and shows. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=8.2s)]
*  But if you go, for example, to Channel One, if you go to any of the other big state-sponsored TV channels, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=12.4s)]
*  it looks on the grid like every single program has the same name. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  For all the channels, for all the time slots, all the shows now have the same name. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  I mean, if you don't read Russian, you can see that they're all the same. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=26.9s)]
*  I don't read Russian, but we had it translated. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=31.5s)]
*  It turns out, according to your TV today in Russia, every single show on every single station [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=34.6s)]
*  and every time slot was titled, On Your Hands Is the Blood of Thousands of Ukrainians [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=40.3s)]
*  and Hundreds of Their Murdered Children, TV and the Authorities Are Lying, No to War. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=44.9s)]
*  That was the title of every show on Russian television today, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=51.7s)]
*  according to everybody's TV grid when they turned on their TVs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=55.2s)]
*  Somebody hacked at least three of the biggest cable TV providers in Russia today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  So that is what it looked like all over Russia when people went to flip on the tube to see what was on, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  to see what the options were. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=70.10000000000001s)]
*  Also today, a fairly major Russian news outlet, one called Lenta, L-E-N-T-A. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=73.0s)]
*  This is their website, lenta.ru. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=80.2s)]
*  And today, same day that somebody hacked all the TVs in Russia, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=83.0s)]
*  today, somebody also rewrote what appeared to be dozens of headlines and dozens of articles on the Lenta News website. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=86.5s)]
*  Now, as you know, as we've been reporting here for the last couple of months, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=95.3s)]
*  no independent media is allowed to operate anymore in Russia. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=100.1s)]
*  Putin has made it literally a crime, a crime punishable by 15 years in prison, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=103.6s)]
*  to report on his war in Ukraine or even to call it a war. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=109.0s)]
*  But look at what the Lenta website looked like earlier today in Russia. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=113.6s)]
*  Now, this is with English translation, so you can see what these headlines look at. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=119.5s)]
*  But oh boy, wow, this isn't normal. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=123.8s)]
*  Vladimir Putin lied about Russia's plans in Ukraine. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=126.0s)]
*  Putin unleashed one of the bloodiest wars of the 21st century. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=129.7s)]
*  These are all the headlines on the news website today. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=132.6s)]
*  Record spending on the army did not help Russia defeat Ukraine. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=134.7s)]
*  The Ministry of Defense lied to the relatives of those killed on the cruiser, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=138.1s)]
*  Moskva, that big Russian naval ship that was sunk by a Ukrainian missile. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  Also this one, Russia completely destroyed the city of Mariupol. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=146.9s)]
*  Russia leaves the corpses of its soldiers in Ukraine. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=151.1s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is afraid to reveal the truth about his family. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  Putin turned the state into the main robber, meaning like the main thief of Russians. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=157.9s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has turned into a pathetic dictator and paranoid. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  Russia threatens to destroy the whole world. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=167.9s)]
*  Zelensky turned out to be cooler than Putin. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=171.1s)]
*  War makes it easier to cover up failures in the economy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=174.6s)]
*  Putin must go. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  He unleashed a senseless war and is leading Russia into the abyss. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=178.8s)]
*  Again, this was all today. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=184.8s)]
*  Those were all separate headlines today on one of the biggest pro-Kremlin state-controlled news sites in Russia. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=186.4s)]
*  And it wasn't just the headlines that they changed. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=193.6s)]
*  Each one of those that I just described to you, each one of those headlines I just read, goes to a full article. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=195.9s)]
*  That has also been rewritten. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=202.4s)]
*  I mean, in a country where they do not allow journalism anymore, they do not allow criticism of the government and especially of the war, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=204.5s)]
*  these sentences posted today on a Russian news site, these were like a DEFCON 1 level threat to the state. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=211.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=218.6s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin bears full responsibility for the senseless and bloody war against Ukraine. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=219.9s)]
*  Guided by far-fetched pretexts about threats to Russia, the head of state plunged two neighboring peoples into a war in which there will be no winners, only losers. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=225.9s)]
*  The president's decision will cost the country isolation, poverty, and a rollback to the very 90s that Putin loves to scare Russians with. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=234.5s)]
*  In more than 20 years of his reign, he has turned into a dictator who began to believe in conspiracy theories and who lost touch with reality. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  Right now, Putin is depriving millions of Russians of their future. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=250.3s)]
*  And taking the lives of innocent Ukrainians, Vladimir Putin must immediately stop the war and resign. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=255.1s)]
*  It is one thing to read that in a Western news source or to read that in any news source in the world anywhere other than in Russia, but to read that in Russia. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=262.3s)]
*  But again, today, that was a Russian major news site today altered to include that article and dozens of others like it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=273.9s)]
*  And if you started going through them, you noticed that there were a few things that were consistent in each of the new articles that was posted. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=281.7s)]
*  For example, near the top of each of the articles that was posted on this Russian news site today, there was a disclaimer warning that this had been posted without the permission of the news organization saying that it was definitely going to be taken down. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=287.90000000000003s)]
*  So if you want to read this, take a screenshot of it immediately because this won't last. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=299.7s)]
*  And indeed, that disclaimer was true. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=303.5s)]
*  All those articles and headlines were almost immediately taken down off that Russian news site today. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=306.9s)]
*  But they were up there for long enough that the great and good people at the Internet Archive, the way back machine, they captured and saved all of it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=311.5s)]
*  They've got screenshots. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=320.7s)]
*  They've got the historical record of what those news sites looked like when the truthful anti-Putin stuff was posted just for moments. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=321.7s)]
*  And in this case, what's fascinating is that we know who did it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=330.9s)]
*  Two journalists, two young journalists who used to work for Lenta for this news organization, they say that they did it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=334.3s)]
*  They have reportedly fled Russia. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=343.7s)]
*  They are outside Russia personally. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=345.6s)]
*  They apparently still had logins to access the news site. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=347.5s)]
*  So that is how they did it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=350.7s)]
*  They obviously prepared all this material, logged in, uploaded everything, logged out and got out. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=352.5s)]
*  But they posted today identifying themselves by name as the people who did it, Igor Polyakov and Alexandra Miroshnikova. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=358.9s)]
*  They gave their names. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=370.4s)]
*  They stood up and said, we're the ones who did this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=373.0s)]
*  And then they said, quote, we are looking for work and lawyers and probably political asylum. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=375.4s)]
*  And then they sign off with this, quote, do not be afraid. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=383.29999999999995s)]
*  Do not be silent. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=385.5s)]
*  Resist. You are not alone. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=386.7s)]
*  We are many. The future is ours. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=388.3s)]
*  F war. Peace to Ukraine. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=390.1s)]
*  And we do not know where those two brave Russian journalists are tonight. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=392.5s)]
*  The ones who did that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=399.8s)]
*  Again, it has been reported that they are outside Russia, but we do not know where they are. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=400.7s)]
*  We also don't know who hacked all the TVs in Russia today either. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=404.6s)]
*  But man, this is living manifest hope that bravery is contagious. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=408.3s)]
*  That dictatorships are brittle, that they have to criminalize journalism and criticism of all kinds because they know it's powerful, because they know they can't survive the truth. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=416.7s)]
*  Joining us now is David Remnick. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=428.9s)]
*  He is editor of the New Yorker. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=432.7s)]
*  He's also a former Moscow correspondent for the Washington Post. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=434.2s)]
*  He won a Pulitzer Prize for a book he wrote based on his time there, which is called Lenin's Tomb, The Last Days of the Soviet Empire. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=436.7s)]
*  Mr. Remnick, it's a real pleasure to have you here. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=443.8s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=446.0s)]
*  I'm asking those questions in that introduction tonight because I honestly don't know what the answer to them is. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=447.70000000000005s)]
*  But I feel like our assumptions are getting a little wobbly. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  Our expectations about Putin's behavior, not just towards Ukraine, but toward us, are starting to be mismatched with what we're seeing from him in reality. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=459.3s)]
*  Do you think that's fair? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  I think it's very fair. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=468.90000000000003s)]
*  Let's put it this way. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=470.3s)]
*  I woke up deliberately at 430 in the morning hoping to read in real time or watch Putin's speech on Red Square. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=471.2s)]
*  As you pointed out in your really excellent summation of what happened today and what's going on, May 9th is always a big deal because it is the great national unifying narrative, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=481.09999999999997s)]
*  the victory in what's called the Great Patriotic War. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=494.7s)]
*  As important as it is here, it's in many ways much more important in Soviet history and even in the post-Soviet space. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=497.90000000000003s)]
*  He said nothing. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=506.90000000000003s)]
*  You have it exactly right. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=508.1s)]
*  I kept I read immediately in Russian and then in English thinking, you know, my Russian is lagging. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=509.6s)]
*  I read it on the Kremlin website and I kept waiting for the payoff pitch and it never came. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=514.8s)]
*  It never came. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=520.8s)]
*  And what you found there was just the resuscitation, the repetition of what I would call a salvation narrative. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=522.2s)]
*  You can't possibly say in real terms why he invaded Ukraine. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=531.2s)]
*  Invaded Ukraine because he wants to battle to battle with the West after long years of resentment. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=536.7s)]
*  He invaded Ukraine because it was growing fitfully, more and more democratic, more and more away from Russia. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=543.1s)]
*  And more and more away from his conception of some form of modern imperial Russia. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=551.4s)]
*  So he needs a vocabulary for that to relate to the Russian people and it's not there. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=559.8s)]
*  And so that's where the invention of Nazis comes from. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=565.5s)]
*  Yes, there are people on that are there are some people who are on the far right, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=568.9s)]
*  nationalists in Ukraine, but to call this a national trend or to not fail to see or to fail to see that that nationalism comes from somewhere is to know nothing about Ukrainian history or the idea that Putin has a problem with far right nationalism. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=573.6s)]
*  I mean, given all over the place in Russia, including in his own in his own house. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=589.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=596.5s)]
*  And he's losing it. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=597.2s)]
*  And, you know, I thought I was full of news here coming having read, you know, a Russian website all about Linda dot Roo and all those amazing things that went up. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=600.3s)]
*  And you obviously you had it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=609.0s)]
*  And it's a terrific thing. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=611.4s)]
*  It made me think of a different time in 1968. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=613.0s)]
*  The Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia to put down what was called the Prague Spring. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=618.5999999999999s)]
*  What happened? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=626.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=627.6s)]
*  In Soviet terms, seven or eight very brave people, including somebody pushing a baby carriage came to Red Square and took out banners and said Czechoslovakia. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=628.0s)]
*  We are with you. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=642.3s)]
*  We're against this invasion within a minute. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=643.7s)]
*  Within a minute, predictably, KGB officers are obviously guarding Red Square in the Kremlin were on these people beat the hell out of them. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=647.5s)]
*  All those people were arrested and most went off to prison camps. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=654.5s)]
*  Pavel Ivanov, somebody I wrote about Lenin's two many, many years ago. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=658.1s)]
*  That was a one minute long, almost invisible protest. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=662.5s)]
*  And it had immense repercussions with the years. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=669.1s)]
*  The dissident movement was inspired by it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=671.1s)]
*  Sakharov was inspired by it, you know, became more and more overtly. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=673.6s)]
*  Andrei Sakharov, leader of a dissident movement. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=678.1s)]
*  It's hard to know what instances like this, like this demonstration on Lent-a-Roo of incredible bravery or that woman who some weeks ago ran behind the TV presenter and also during the nightly news. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=681.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=698.2s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=699.0s)]
*  And I think it is the presumption is that everybody is for this war because everybody listens to propaganda television. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=700.5s)]
*  And that's that. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=707.7s)]
*  I think as time goes by, because people are not stupid, because mothers are receiving phone calls from their sons at the front, because casualties are building up and the economic repercussions are making themselves known that the ability to keep all this information out of the public consciousness will recede. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=709.1s)]
*  And his problems will not only be just military, his problems will not only be just his confrontations with the West, but I think it is entirely possible that as his fury grows, so too will his problems. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=735.9s)]
*  Which should change our expectations in terms of what he believes he can ask the Russian people for or he can tell the Russian people they're about to deliver. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=750.6s)]
*  What we were waiting for this morning. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=759.4s)]
*  Was a big mobilization. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=760.8s)]
*  Mobilization. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=762.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=762.6999999999999s)]
*  So people that were reservists, kids from all over the country or young men from all over the country, first of all that would have enormous economic repercussions. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=763.5s)]
*  It would heighten alarm among the general population about what's at stake in Ukraine. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=773.1s)]
*  Why is this taking so long? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=778.6s)]
*  What is this special military operation? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=780.8s)]
*  It seems a lot more serious than that. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=783.6999999999999s)]
*  And the nonsense begins to corrode. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=786.1s)]
*  One of the information things that happened this week is an awful guy on Russian television named Vladimir Soloviev. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=790.5s)]
*  And he runs some spectacular propaganda television shows. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=798.8s)]
*  He was sent to Mariupol to kind of lead the propaganda. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=803.8s)]
*  Imagine Chuck Carlson being sent to, I don't know, Charlottesville to whip up the fervor in a kind of civil war. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=810.0s)]
*  That's the move. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=818.5s)]
*  That's the move. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=820.2s)]
*  And it doesn't really work. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=821.7s)]
*  It doesn't really work. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=824.5s)]
*  He was supposed to inspire the people of Mariupol to get excited about Russia invading them. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=825.7s)]
*  Well, and also to be filmed and shown to the folks back. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=829.7s)]
*  David Rennick. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=833.8000000000001s)]
*  That we're liberators. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=834.5s)]
*  This understanding about how this what the room in which Putin feels he can maneuver, even if he is, as you say, losing it, I think is going to change the American [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=836.5s)]
*  calibration in terms of how much we can maneuver and how he may respond. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=846.9s)]
*  And I feel like we are only starting to figure it out. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=851.9s)]
*  See if you can spot the theme here. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=856.3s)]
*  We're going to start in Missouri, the field running to be the Republican candidate for U.S. Senator in Missouri. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=857.9s)]
*  It includes the state's disgraced former governor, Eric Greitens. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=863.5999999999999s)]
*  Now, the reason Republican Eric Greitens is the former governor of Missouri is because he was forced to resign amid multiple scandals, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=868.4s)]
*  including allegations that he forced a woman into a non-consensual sexual encounter, photographed it and then blackmailed her about it with the photos. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=876.4s)]
*  That's why he was forced out of the governorship in Missouri. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  He has since decided that he's over it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  The people of Missouri should be too. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=892.3s)]
*  And so he's jumped into the U.S. Senate race in that state as well. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=894.1999999999999s)]
*  Since jumping into the Senate race, Mr. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=897.4s)]
*  Greitens has faced brand new allegations from his ex-wife. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=899.1999999999999s)]
*  She says that he physically abused both her and their children. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=902.3s)]
*  Wow, things like this sort of keep coming up with this guy. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=907.5999999999999s)]
*  Nevertheless, an internal poll the Greitens campaign shared with reporters today purportedly shows him leading the Republican primary field for Missouri Senate. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=910.8s)]
*  If you believe their poll, that guy with that record is the leading candidate to be the Republican nominee for the United States Senate from Missouri. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=920.1999999999999s)]
*  That's Missouri. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=927.6999999999999s)]
*  How about Georgia? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=929.1s)]
*  The leading Republican candidate for U.S. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=930.3s)]
*  Senate in Georgia is this guy. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=932.6s)]
*  His name is Herschel Walker. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=935.1s)]
*  Mr. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=936.7s)]
*  Walker's ex-wife accused him of physically abusive and extremely threatening behavior during their marriage, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=936.9s)]
*  including holding a pistol to her head and threatening to, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=943.0s)]
*  quote, blow her brains out. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=945.9s)]
*  According to documents obtained by the AP several years after their divorce, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=948.5s)]
*  Herschel Walker's ex-wife secured a protective order against him after he repeatedly called her sister [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=952.4s)]
*  and her father threatening again that he was going to kill her. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=957.7s)]
*  So that's the Republican Party's leading candidate for Senate in the great state of Georgia. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=962.7s)]
*  How about in the great state of Pennsylvania? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=968.2s)]
*  Well, not only is there leading Republican candidate for governor, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=970.5s)]
*  a guy who was literally part of the mob that attacked the U.S. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=973.7s)]
*  Capitol on January 6th, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=976.5s)]
*  but the guy he endorsed for lieutenant governor has just been ordered by a judge to stay away from his own home after his wife obtained a protective order [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=978.1s)]
*  over claims of physical and mental abuse. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=986.5s)]
*  She accuses him of stalking her at work and screaming at her, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=988.9s)]
*  grabbing her by the shirt and threatening to kill the family dog. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=991.9s)]
*  Okay, Pennsylvania Republicans. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=997.3s)]
*  How about Ohio? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1000.7s)]
*  Republican voters in Ohio's 9th congressional district have been getting a lot of attention over the last few days [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1002.0s)]
*  because they just handed the Republican nomination for one congressional seat to another guy who was at the January 6th riot. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1007.2s)]
*  But in the 7th congressional district, a former Donald Trump staffer won that Republican primary a few days ago as well, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1015.5s)]
*  even after he was publicly accused of assault by his ex-girlfriend. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1021.7s)]
*  And in his case, the ex-girlfriend making the allegations of physical assault was the Trump White House press secretary. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1027.2s)]
*  A senior member of the Trump White House says he physically abused her. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1033.5s)]
*  Doesn't seem to matter. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1038.9s)]
*  Trump endorsed him. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1040.5s)]
*  He won his primary with 70 percent of the vote. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1041.6s)]
*  And I know this almost sounds like I'm like being hyperbolic or I'm like rounding up to the next worst thing when you line all these guys up. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1044.9s)]
*  But honestly, that's just all the facts. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1053.2s)]
*  We haven't even gotten to this headline out of Indiana this weekend. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1057.1000000000001s)]
*  Not exaggerating. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1059.5s)]
*  This is a real headline. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1060.3000000000002s)]
*  Quote, man accused of killing his wife wins Republican primary from jail. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1061.8000000000002s)]
*  Dude is in jail on charges of murdering his wife and he won his Republican primary for a municipal board in Indiana. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1067.5s)]
*  He will be on the ballot in November unless he is convicted by then of murdering his wife. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1078.4s)]
*  But being in jail on those charges wasn't a problem. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1085.5s)]
*  If the Republican Party was a private company, their HR department would be blowing through all their overtime just this week. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1090.0s)]
*  And you know, things like this happen from time to time. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1097.5s)]
*  You definitely get people accused of doing horrible things who nevertheless end up rising in politics. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1099.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1105.2s)]
*  But this is an unusually dense concentration of them for this cycle for the Republican Party. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1106.0s)]
*  Like how many of these do we need before we start calling it this year's pattern? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1111.9s)]
*  And it is absolutely stunning that the Republican Party is fielding all of these men accused of all of these horrible things involving women. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1116.7s)]
*  But that is happening in such an incredible concentration while the Republican Party this year is set to be running in the context of banning abortion. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1123.4s)]
*  Right. In the wake of the leaked draft Supreme Court majority ruling overturning Roe versus Wade, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1132.0s)]
*  the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said this weekend that it's possible Republicans will pursue a federal nationwide abortion ban. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1136.9s)]
*  If the Republicans are lucky enough to take over Congress. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1145.2s)]
*  If you record this show on your DVR, if you have your TV or your DVR to set up to record the Rachel Maddow show every night at 9 p.m. Eastern, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1150.0s)]
*  first of all, thank you. You've kept me in blue all these years. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1158.4s)]
*  Thank you. But also, I now need you to do another thing. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1161.4s)]
*  Keep the DVR setting that you've got now where you record the Rachel Maddow show. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1164.6000000000001s)]
*  That's still good. But you also now need to add the show MSNBC Prime to your DVR recordings. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1167.8s)]
*  And the reason you need both of those is that I'm mostly going to be here on Mondays, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1173.7s)]
*  even though our whole team is working to produce the show every night at 9 p.m. Eastern. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1177.9s)]
*  But in addition to every Monday that I'm here, I will also be here for big news events, including some that might arise on short notice. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1182.0s)]
*  So you need to set your DVR to record every night at 9 p.m. Eastern, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1189.2s)]
*  which means setting it to record the Rachel Maddow show and also MSNBC Prime. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1193.1000000000001s)]
*  Please. Thank you. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1199.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDlkWV8aKqc&t=1203.7s)]
