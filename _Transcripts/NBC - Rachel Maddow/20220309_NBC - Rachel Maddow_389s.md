# Why Not Planes? West's Aid To Ukraine Hits Snag On Fighter Jets
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM)
*  Now, despite the repeat calls from Ukrainian people and its leaders to enforce this no-fly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=0.0s)]
*  zone over the country, the United States and NATO remain resistant to that idea. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=6.0600000000000005s)]
*  But one NATO ally is trying to assist Ukraine in the skies in a different way. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=10.68s)]
*  Today, Poland announced that it would be transferring its entire fleet of MiG-29 jet fighters to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=15.92s)]
*  the U.S. Air Base in Germany, with the expectation that the United States would then donate those [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=22.84s)]
*  jets to Ukraine, whose fighter pilots know how to fly the Russian-made MiGs. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=27.6s)]
*  That proposal is not only a logistical quagmire, but also runs the serious risk of triggering [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=33.08s)]
*  Russia's retaliation against the United States for assisting the Ukrainian military effort. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=37.96s)]
*  The Defense Department threw cold water on Poland's proposal tonight, saying that it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=44.0s)]
*  does not believe that there is a clear rationale to transfer jets from a NATO country into [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=47.32s)]
*  conflict and that the United States is not convinced that this plan is tenable. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=53.72s)]
*  Today, President Biden did announce that the United States would ban the import of Russian [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=58.28s)]
*  oil and natural gas into the country. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  The U.K. today said it will do the same thing by the end of the year, exporting oil and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=65.52s)]
*  gas. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=70.28s)]
*  Keep in mind, this is how Russia makes most of its money, so this is going to hit Russia [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=71.28s)]
*  where it hurts the most. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=75.08s)]
*  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the move in a video released this evening. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=77.44s)]
*  He said he's personally thankful to President Biden for making this decision that will [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=81.2s)]
*  quote, quote, make Russia pay for their aggression and answer for the evil that they have done. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=86.16s)]
*  Joining us live from Ukraine is Andrei Zagorotniuk. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=92.88s)]
*  He's the former Ukrainian Minister of Defense, as well as the Chairman of the Security Think [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=95.88s)]
*  Tank Center for Defense Strategies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=100.72s)]
*  Sir, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=103.44s)]
*  I have to ask you, everybody I've talked to in the government, the Ukrainian government, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=105.76s)]
*  can't be more proud of the resistance, the civilian resistance, the territorial defense, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=111.12s)]
*  and the actions of the Ukrainian defense forces. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=116.2s)]
*  But they have all said that Ukraine cannot withstand the power of Russia without more [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=119.92s)]
*  help from the West. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=125.84s)]
*  Now we've heard the Defense Department and the United States say this plain trade with [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  Poland is not actually going to happen. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to that first. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=136.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, we were quite welcoming, of course, the move of Poland. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=137.12s)]
*  And I don't understand why shouldn't it happen if one country, sovereign nation, wants to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=140.92s)]
*  help its neighbor and to transfer the equipment. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=144.76s)]
*  U.S. has been transferring to us like millions of dollars, hundreds of million dollars of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=148.84s)]
*  equipment of different kinds. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=153.72s)]
*  So why that cannot be planes? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  To be honest, I sincerely hope this is a relatively recent news like from tonight, but I sincerely [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  hope that the US wasn't like serious about saying that, no, it's not going to transfer [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=163.28s)]
*  the planes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=168.6s)]
*  We believe this would be considered. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=169.6s)]
*  You know, we're going to be speaking to Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman in a moment, but [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=171.84s)]
*  he said something the other day in which he said things that were unthinkable two weeks [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=178.2s)]
*  ago are real today. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=181.72s)]
*  Things that will be unthinkable today will be real two weeks from now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=183.12s)]
*  So to that degree, what is it that that what kind of creative thinking can you suggest [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=186.36s)]
*  to the West, to NATO, to the United States to say, look, if you don't want to get into [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=192.04s)]
*  a direct fighting war with Russia, here are the other options that you might consider? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=195.92s)]
*  Yeah, so the options were, of course, it's helping with the fighter jets and so to enhance [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=201.04s)]
*  our air force capability, also the transferring air defense weapons in order for us to protect [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=205.8s)]
*  our skies more and also to set up even in the limited range, some sort of non-fly zone, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=213.56s)]
*  at least in a part of the country where we could guarantee that people would feel safe, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=219.64s)]
*  because right now there is no such place in Ukraine where people feel safe. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  And that creates possibly a much bigger problem of possibly even tens of millions of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=227.92s)]
*  refugees. So Ukrainian armed forces are actually quite successful on the ground. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  And actually, they their casualties from Russia is over well over 10,000. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=239.48s)]
*  And there are also wounded soldiers from Russian army, tens of thousands already. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=245.88s)]
*  So actually, their ground capability and their manpower capability is reducing, but they [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=252.04000000000002s)]
*  still have a substantial advantage in the sky, which they use over and over again, as we [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=258.04s)]
*  can see in the only civilian infrastructure over again every night, every day. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=262.8s)]
*  So that has to be addressed indeed. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=268.4s)]
*  What is the thing that you think is going to convince your your Western neighbors and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=270.52s)]
*  NATO to do something? You just heard Richard Engel talking about the fact that a hospital [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=278.28s)]
*  has had to be evacuated. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=282.68s)]
*  We continue to see confirmed reports of civilian casualties, attacks that look like in some [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  cases they are deliberate. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=289.0s)]
*  Some of them are are the circumstance of bombing or missiles, but some of them seem to be [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  deliberate attacks on civilians. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=294.44s)]
*  These are war crimes. If they are true, is that the thing that's going to convince the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=296.0s)]
*  West to say, look, at the very least, create humanitarian corridors to let our people [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=300.24s)]
*  travel or let them out? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=304.72s)]
*  Exactly. Humanitarian corridors and humanitarian zones, some sort of protected areas, I just [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=307.12s)]
*  said. But honestly speaking, there's most of these shellings are nothing to do with [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=312.44s)]
*  the war effort. They're just they're just terrorizing civilians because they've been [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=317.76s)]
*  shelled lots of buildings which have which are not even close to the military objects. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=322.16s)]
*  And they are war crimes. And of course, we have more more than enough evidence for that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  from all from all different towns and villages and so on. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=331.52s)]
*  So, yes, there are there are solutions and U.S. diplomats and U.S. experts and military [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  personnel, I mean, DOD and so on. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=341.48s)]
*  They do know exactly what what could be done. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=343.44s)]
*  So I believe it's just to forming a finally a policy about that and just to making decision [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=347.12s)]
*  because every day decision is delayed. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  We see the more casualties that that simple as that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  And of course, we see more refugees streaming over these borders, including the places like [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=360.08000000000004s)]
*  where I am, Andres, I go right now. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=364.36s)]
*  We appreciate your time. Thank you for joining us this evening. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o724C_vANkM&t=366.40000000000003s)]
