# Why The Sinking Of Russia's 'Moskova' Battleship Matters
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM)
*  In 2008, Vladimir Putin invaded Georgia, the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=0.0s)]
*  During that invasion, Russia sent its flagship guided missile cruiser, the Moskva, to the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=5.28s)]
*  Black Sea to support that invasion of Georgia. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=10.88s)]
*  Six years later, Putin invaded Ukraine. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  He invaded and took Crimea, part of Ukraine, in 2014. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=17.04s)]
*  And again, that same ship, the Moskva, was deployed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=21.42s)]
*  It played a critical role in blocking Ukrainian ships from leaving an important naval base [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=23.64s)]
*  to try to confront the Russians. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=28.74s)]
*  Then one year later, in 2015, the Moskva was once again deployed, this time to support [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=31.14s)]
*  Russia's brutal military campaign in Syria in support of the dictator Bashar al-Assad. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=35.78s)]
*  So the Moskva is really their go-to warship. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=43.38s)]
*  It has an extensive recent history in playing a key military role every time Putin keeps [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=46.06s)]
*  trying to redraw the maps of the former Soviet Union. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  Well now, this flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet has apparently been sunk. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=55.94s)]
*  The Ukrainian government is claiming that the ship sunk after it was hit by a Ukrainian-made [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=61.26s)]
*  Neptune anti-ship missile. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=66.1s)]
*  The Russian version of the story is that that isn't why the ship sunk. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=69.06s)]
*  It sunk due to a fire, due to, quote, hole damage received during a fire from the detonation [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=72.62s)]
*  of ammunition. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=78.5s)]
*  The United States has reportedly not confirmed either version of events, but it's already [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=80.5s)]
*  had a practical effect on the state of play in the Black Sea. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=85.58s)]
*  One senior U.S. defense official told reporters that about half a dozen Russian ships in the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=88.62s)]
*  Black Sea moved themselves farther out to sea, farther off the Ukrainian coast, after [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=93.34s)]
*  the Moskva was hit. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=99.02s)]
*  But you think about it, it's not the sort of thing you would do if the Moskva went down [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  because somebody was, like, smoking in the ammunition room, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=104.3s)]
*  Why would that sort of a catastrophe on board your flagship vessel cause you to move all [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=107.86s)]
*  of the other ships further offshore? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=112.66s)]
*  That wouldn't solve the problem if you guys just started a fire on board your own ship. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=115.06s)]
*  And the Russians are obviously trying to save face by saying it was just a fire, by denying [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=120.02s)]
*  it was that the Ukrainians sunk it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=125.16s)]
*  But either way, the damage is done. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=127.22s)]
*  The ship is gone. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=129.26s)]
*  And if you think about for a second how they are trying to make it all sound, it's not [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=131.36s)]
*  even a really good argument. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=134.94s)]
*  As U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan put it today, quote, one story is that it [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=136.86s)]
*  was just incompetence, meaning we set a fire on board our own ship. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  The other story is that they came under attack. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=146.54000000000002s)]
*  Neither is a particularly good outcome for them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=148.9s)]
*  My next guest agrees with this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=153.06s)]
*  Joining us now is Mason Clark. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=154.78000000000003s)]
*  He's the lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=156.22000000000003s)]
*  Mr. Clark, I appreciate you taking time to be with us tonight. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=161.06s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=162.06s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=163.46s)]
*  We have had a lot of discussion already, even before we knew that the Moskva was lost, when [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=165.18s)]
*  we just heard that it might have been hit or that it was somehow damaged for some reason. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=171.06s)]
*  We've heard a lot about how that would have a morale impact, that that would boost the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=175.18s)]
*  morale of the Ukrainians and it would hurt the morale of the Russians. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=178.98000000000002s)]
*  I know morale is a practical thing in wartime, but beyond just the morale factor, how important [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  is this loss in practical terms for the Russians? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=188.26000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=191.78s)]
*  So it's certainly more important in terms of the morale swing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=193.44s)]
*  Of course, the Moskva was very infamous as the Russian warship involved in the Snake [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=196.56s)]
*  Island incident at the beginning of the war. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=200.76s)]
*  But in terms of actual capabilities, it's certainly supported the Russian campaign through [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  a number of guided missile strikes, particularly on Ukrainian rear areas. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=208.42s)]
*  But those have been a very small proportion of the air and missile strikes that Russian [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=213.0s)]
*  forces have carried out throughout the war. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=217.52s)]
*  So while it's certainly a blow, it's not going to change the course of the campaign, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=219.76s)]
*  I'd say, by depriving the Russians of any capability. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=224.64s)]
*  Now, of course, with the Russian warships backing off from the Black Sea coast, as you [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=227.6s)]
*  noted, not something you would do if you had a fire just near ammunition area, that's likely [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  going to deprive some of those Russian forces along the coast of air defenses against the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=237.14s)]
*  Ukrainian Air Force that some of these warships have been providing. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=242.6s)]
*  So that may be a more immediate tactical impact. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=245.46s)]
*  But in terms of actual Russian offensive capabilities, frankly, these warships have not been that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=248.66s)]
*  essential to begin with. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  And in terms of the Ukrainian offensive capabilities, if Ukraine is borne out, if they're correct, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=256.22s)]
*  that they were able to sink this warship effectively with a missile strike. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=262.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm no expert in naval warfare, but as far as I know, that's a pretty rare way, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=266.94s)]
*  way to sink a warship, particularly one of this size. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=272.66s)]
*  And it would indicate that Ukraine has more capacity of this type. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=277.22s)]
*  They've got weapons that haven't previously been used in wartime that might be more effective [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=283.82000000000005s)]
*  than had been previously conceived. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=288.42s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=290.42s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=291.42s)]
*  This is actually likely the first time that Neptune has been used in combat. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=293.42s)]
*  It was only introduced in the Ukrainian arsenal, I believe, in 2019. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=296.94000000000005s)]
*  It was quite recently and with its domestic Ukrainian missile. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  But even in addition to this, Ukraine is increasingly receiving similar systems from the UK and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=304.94s)]
*  various other Western partners that will allow them to push back on Russian dominance in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=310.3s)]
*  the Black Sea. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=314.86s)]
*  We've already assessed for some time that there's very little chance that the Russians [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=316.38s)]
*  would be able to mount an amphibious invasion on the southern coast of Ukraine, which was [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=319.66s)]
*  a worry earlier in the war, but particularly with Ukraine almost certainly having demonstrated [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=323.7s)]
*  that it could threaten such a landing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=328.66s)]
*  It has to be completely off the table. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=330.58000000000004s)]
*  And it's definitely going to be a huge boon to the Ukrainian military and sort of lessening [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=333.06s)]
*  that threat and enabling them probably to carry out their own operations on the Black [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=337.86s)]
*  Sea, whereas the Ukrainian Navy has been pretty bottled up in ports since the early days of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=342.98s)]
*  the war, at least until now. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=347.54s)]
*  Mr. Clark, can I also just ask you, there's a lot of discussion now, including discussion [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  led by the U.S. government, sort of advising the U.S. public what to think about what's [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=355.66s)]
*  going to come next. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=359.42s)]
*  We're told to expect that Russia is regrouping, repositioning, and that they're planning [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=360.42s)]
*  for a major ground operation in eastern Ukraine and perhaps also in southern Ukraine. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=366.18s)]
*  Are we seeing the kind of movement of forces? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  Are we seeing the kind of massing of forces that would indicate that something like that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=377.16s)]
*  is imminent? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=381.58000000000004s)]
*  Is it possible that Russia isn't about to mount an operation that that large or that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=382.58s)]
*  it might be further off in the future than we've been led to believe? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=387.38s)]
*  It just doesn't seem like they've got the manpower and the material in place to do something [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=390.7s)]
*  of this on the scale that we've been led to expect. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=395.46s)]
*  Well, you've sort of hit the nail on the head right there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=398.5s)]
*  They're trying to, but we don't think it's going to be very effective. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=402.34s)]
*  We are seeing a lot of signs on the ground, both reports from Ukrainian intelligence as [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=405.38s)]
*  well as just videos from both Russian and Ukrainian civilians of large Russian columns [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=409.26s)]
*  moving from the northeastern Ukrainian border down into Rostov and other key Russian cities [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=415.58s)]
*  supporting those operations in eastern Ukraine. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=420.7s)]
*  The issue, though, is that a lot of these units were badly chewed up in fighting around [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=423.78s)]
*  Kiev and Trenlyhev and Sumy, these areas in northeastern Ukraine that Russian forces [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=428.58s)]
*  have had to abandon in the last couple of weeks. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  They have not really had the time to reform, replace lost equipment, restore morale. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=435.78s)]
*  These troops are very demoralized and they're unlikely to really contribute much to Russian [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=440.85999999999996s)]
*  combat power in their damaged state. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=445.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't want to overstate that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=448.5s)]
*  Unfortunately, just the sheer weight of numbers and the resources of the Russian military [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=450.17999999999995s)]
*  may be able to push through Ukrainian defenses in some areas when they do launch a wider [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  offensive likely in the next week or two. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=457.9s)]
*  But I certainly don't think that the Russian military has the capability to conduct the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=460.29999999999995s)]
*  large breakthrough that they would like to at this point in the war due to how badly [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=464.3s)]
*  their initial operations went and how sparse their remaining reserves are. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=469.34000000000003s)]
*  Mason Clark, the lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=475.26s)]
*  Mr. Clark, it's clarifying and interesting to talk to you about this. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=478.54s)]
*  Thanks for making time to be with us tonight. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=481.66s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=484.14s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCpSxLF0cYM&t=485.14s)]
