# High Stakes Challenge In Ukraine: How Far To Push Putin
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g)
*  But Russia is also ramping up its threats to try and ward off more Western intervention. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=0.0s)]
*  The Washington Post was first to report that Russian officials have sent a formal diplomatic [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=4.32s)]
*  message to the United States warning that U.S. and NATO shipments of the most sensitive weapon [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=8.64s)]
*  systems to Ukraine were adding fuel to the conflict there and could bring unpredictable [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=14.08s)]
*  consequences. Now, that may sound like more bluster from an increasingly isolated world leader, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  but the threat of unpredictable consequences is sadly not an empty one. Yesterday, the head [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=24.16s)]
*  of the CIA made that point very clear during a public speech. Given the potential desperation of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=29.28s)]
*  President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they've faced so far militarily, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=38.24s)]
*  none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=44.8s)]
*  low yield nuclear weapons. In an interview with CNN, Ukrainian President Zelensky echoed those [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=51.92s)]
*  sentiments saying the world should prepare for the possibility of a nuclear strike inside of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=57.68s)]
*  Ukraine. There have been differing opinions from experts about the threat of a Russian nuclear [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=62.72s)]
*  strike since this war began, but there is no question that Russia's nuclear arsenal hangs like [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=67.6s)]
*  a sword of Damocles over every decision Western powers make in this conflict. If Russia were to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=72.0s)]
*  resort to using a nuclear weapon inside of Ukraine, tactical or not, it would be the first nuclear [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=77.44s)]
*  strike by any nation since the devastating U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=82.72s)]
*  It would irrevocably change the world in ways we cannot wave off or ignore. So the big question [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=89.12s)]
*  remains as Russia ratchets up its threats to the West just in time for its new assault on Eastern [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=95.28s)]
*  Ukraine, what can we in the West do without provoking a nuclear war with Putin? Joining us [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=100.56s)]
*  now is retired four-star Air Force General Philip Breedlove. General Breedlove served as NATO's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  Supreme Allied Commander from 2013 to 2016. He's now a distinguished chair of the Frontier [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=111.6s)]
*  Europe Initiative at the Middle East Institute. General, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=116.88s)]
*  Let me start by asking you about the situation in Mariupol. I saw a video today from a journalist [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=120.96s)]
*  from the Kyiv Independence showing what's left of the city, which is practically nothing. And [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=126.72s)]
*  this reporter rightly points out that if Russia takes control of the city, they will only keep [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=131.04s)]
*  the land because there's really nothing left there in terms of infrastructure. Explain to our viewers, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=135.44s)]
*  General, why Mariupol is so strategically important to the Russians to the point that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=140.4s)]
*  they'll destroy it in order to take it. Mariupol is key for several reasons. Thanks for having me [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=144.24s)]
*  on tonight. It is one of the two remaining large ports in Ukraine that keep Ukraine connected to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=150.96s)]
*  the rest of the world for commerce and shipment of grain, et cetera. And it is a key spot in that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=158.8s)]
*  land bridge that has been talked so much about from the Lugansk-Donetsk area in Donbas down along [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=166.8s)]
*  the coast towards Crimea. So this is a key piece of terrain, and it's very sad to see it fall. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=174.8s)]
*  We heard reports today that some of the soldiers there were having to surrender because they ran [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=182.4s)]
*  out of bullets and they ran out of food. And this is a failure of us, I think, in the West to get all [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  the supplies they needed into them. And the fall of Mariupol would be a huge blow to Ukrainian morale, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=193.92s)]
*  not to mention a humanitarian crisis, would it not? It would. And sadly, what we will probably [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  find in Mariupol is the same thing that we found in the North from where the Russians have left [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=207.76s)]
*  their fingerprints in terror and in war crimes in an area. And so this is going to be another tough [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=214.32s)]
*  slog to get through what we find in Mariupol. General, you have said in recent interviews that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=222.08s)]
*  you think the United States has been completely deterred by Russia's nukes and Putin, meanwhile, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=228.08s)]
*  is undeterred. You have called in the past for a no-fly zone, a limited no-fly zone. You have said [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=233.28s)]
*  we shouldn't exaggerate the threat from Russian nukes to the point where we don't do anything. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  And yet CIA Director Bill Burns, who dealt with Putin, of course, directly as ambassador to Moscow [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=242.08s)]
*  in the past, he said yesterday we can't take lightly the prospect that Putin would use tactical [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=247.04s)]
*  nukes inside of Ukraine. Do you disagree with Director Burns? No, I don't. I think that we have [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=252.72s)]
*  to take serious a lot of these threats. Mr. Putin has written about this. Mr. Grozumov, a senior [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=260.24s)]
*  general, has written about this. They often say that nuclear weapons are a logical extension of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=266.88s)]
*  the conventional battlefield, whereas we see that completely differently in the West. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=272.96s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is Mr. Putin is extremely good at deterring us, and he is doing [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=278.64s)]
*  this to deter us. And as I understand now, he's declared that our weapons shipments to Ukraine [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=285.12s)]
*  will now cause new possibilities for him. And so we are deterred, and he's seeking to further deter [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=292.64s)]
*  us because it's worked so far. So I just want to get to the bottom of this deterrence point. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=302.32s)]
*  I agree with you. It's deeply frustrating to see the way that Putin can almost blackmail [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  the West with his nuclear arsenal. But reality is reality. If you're saying that you agree with [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=313.04s)]
*  Bill Burns, that he could use tactical nuclear weapons, then we kind of have to be deterred, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=317.28s)]
*  do we not? Or are you saying we can edge forward, we can push forward with more weapons, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=322.0s)]
*  maybe a no-fly zone, as you've advocated in the past, without triggering that use of, God forbid, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=327.28s)]
*  tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine? In our past, we have done this. In northern Syria, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=332.4s)]
*  under a different administration, we took almost a battalion of Russians off the battlefield. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=337.92s)]
*  And we were in the same situation with the same Putin and the same nuclear arsenal facing us in [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=343.92s)]
*  that attack. And so it's just a matter of assessing the risks and then taking the appropriate actions. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=350.0s)]
*  And I think that we need to have those conversations about risks now. The sad thing [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=358.32s)]
*  is I believe there are people in this world who believe there's no risk if we do nothing. And I [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=364.88s)]
*  believe we incur more risk every day. You're 100 percent right. There is risk on both sides, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=370.15999999999997s)]
*  and we do need to have these conversations. And we are having this conversation. I appreciate [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=376.56s)]
*  you having it with me. The Syrian example, though, correct me if I'm wrong, wasn't that a group of [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=379.76s)]
*  Russian mercenaries that were killed in Syria? And of course, Syria doesn't mean the same to Putin [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=383.6s)]
*  as Ukraine does. That was the Wagner group. And as you know, and all the world knows, the Wagner group [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=387.6s)]
*  is an extension of the Russian military. So we took Russian military off the battlefield in northern [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  Syria. I guess the way I see it, and you and I may disagree on this, is I worry that on the one hand, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  we say Vladimir Putin is a genocidal, warmongering, war crime committing madman, the worst leader since [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=407.68s)]
*  Hitler, in which case we really have to take a nuclear threat seriously from a leader like that, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=412.88s)]
*  or he's bluffing he'll never use them, in which case maybe he's not the threat we think he is. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=417.12s)]
*  We can't have it both ways, can we? Well, I don't draw the two distinctions that you do. I think [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  there's a middle ground. I don't think he's bluffing. I think if it goes bad enough for him, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=427.04s)]
*  he may actually take these more drastic actions. But if we allow the world to deter us in this way, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=432.48s)]
*  then every nation that has a nuke looks up and says, OK, I now know how to deal with the United [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=441.44s)]
*  States over Taiwan. I now know how to deal with the United States over South Korea. I now know [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=448.0s)]
*  how to deal with the United States over the missiles I'd like to fire into the Middle East. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=454.96s)]
*  And so I think that at some point, we have to understand that if we are going to allow ourselves [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=460.48s)]
*  to be nuclear blackmailed in every endeavor, then we're going to have a tough time in the world ahead. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=465.84s)]
*  I guess there's never been a better argument for nuclear disarmament. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=473.11999999999995s)]
*  One last question, General. After the massacre in Butchur and the destruction of Mariupol [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=476.56s)]
*  and other attacks by Russian troops in Ukraine, it's very unlikely that the two countries are [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=480.88s)]
*  going to sit down and succeed at a negotiating table any time soon, even though the president [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=484.79999999999995s)]
*  of Ukraine keeps offering Putin a chance for a meeting. Is there any diplomatic off-ramp we [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  can provide to the Russian president to try and persuade him to end his brutal war, which has taken [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=493.52s)]
*  so many lives, to declare whatever fake victory he wants and just go home? Well, I think that's [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=497.76s)]
*  going to be very tough, but you have hit it right on the head. We all want a negotiated ending to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=503.91999999999996s)]
*  this. But what we don't want is for Ukraine to have to give up its sovereign territory [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=510.32s)]
*  and its sovereignty as a nation. And so we need to support President Zelensky, who is a wartime [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=516.72s)]
*  leader of the highest caliber. We need to support him and prepare his troops so that they can earn [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  a better negotiation position at the table. Retired four-star Air Force General and former [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=531.68s)]
*  NATO Supreme Allied Commander Philip Breedlove, thank you so much for your time tonight. I appreciate it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ2aMZWoH1g&t=539.12s)]
