# U.S. foes exploit Trump's divisiveness with fake MAGA accounts; China adopts Russian tactics
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI)
*  They're still doing it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, we reported here a couple of weeks ago on the renewed efforts by Russia to target [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=1.0s)]
*  American elections once again to try to promote Trump's candidacy and to try to hurt his democratic [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=6.68s)]
*  opponent. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  And it's not like I was reporting on some obscure thing a couple of weeks ago when we [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=13.68s)]
*  covered that story. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=17.48s)]
*  I mean, there it is, headline in the New York Times, spate of mock news sites with Russian [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=18.48s)]
*  ties pop up in the United States. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=22.64s)]
*  Russia's still doing it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=26.72s)]
*  They're doing it again, and it is as ham handed and embarrassing as it ever was. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=28.52s)]
*  And they're doing it for the same transparently obvious strategic reasons as they do everything. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=35.24s)]
*  The difference is this time, forewarned is supposedly forearmed, right? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=42.72s)]
*  Knowing that it's coming should make us better prepared. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=46.86s)]
*  Except this time around, some social media companies, particularly Twitter, have no interest [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  and even trying to stop what they're doing to target the election this time around. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=55.36s)]
*  And this time around, many Republicans seem to have lost any qualms they might once have [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=60.36s)]
*  had about helping out with what Russia is doing, even with the really obviously fake [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=64.92s)]
*  stuff. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=71.4s)]
*  But now here's something new, something new on top of that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=75.12s)]
*  It is no longer just Russia. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=80.56s)]
*  Because why would it be, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, the way it's gone, why wouldn't other authoritarian countries who want to weaken [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=83.76s)]
*  the United States and want to denigrate democracy and want to try to get Trump back into the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  White House, why wouldn't they throw their hats in the ring, too? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  It's not like Russia's paid much of a price for it, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=94.2s)]
*  Russia appears to have purchased themselves a significant chunk of one of the two major [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=97.4s)]
*  governing parties in the United States for the price of a few sanctions and a few intelligence [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=100.68s)]
*  officers being unable to travel for fear of arrest. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  That's basically the price they've paid for the Republican Party and the conservative [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=109.16s)]
*  movement hopping into bed with them in a very serious way, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  That's cheap if you're willing to buy it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=117.72s)]
*  And so of course, it's no longer just them. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=120.2s)]
*  Headline today in the New York Times. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  China's advancing efforts to influence US election raise alarms. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=129.0s)]
*  Quote, researchers and government officials say China has adopted some of the same misinformation [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=134.56s)]
*  tactics that Russia used ahead of the 2016 election. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=139.0s)]
*  Quote, covert Chinese accounts are masquerading online as American supporters of former President [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=143.24s)]
*  Donald J. Trump, promoting conspiracy theories, stoking domestic divisions, and attacking [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  President Biden ahead of the election in November, according to researchers and government officials. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  The accounts signal a potential tactical shift in how China aims to influence American [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=159.16s)]
*  politics with more of a willingness to target specific candidates and parties, including [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=164.04s)]
*  Mr. Biden. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=169.04s)]
*  In an echo of Russia's influence campaign before the 2016 election, China appears to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=170.56s)]
*  be trying to harness partisan divisions to undermine the Biden administration's policies. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=175.28s)]
*  Some of these Chinese accounts impersonate fervent Trump fans, including one on Twitter [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=180.6s)]
*  that purports to be a quote, father, husband and son, who is quote, MAGA all the way. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=185.68s)]
*  The accounts mocked Mr. Biden's age and shared fake images of him in a prison jumpsuit or [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=192.84s)]
*  claimed that Mr. Biden was a Satanist pedophile while promoting Mr. Trump's make America [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=199.1s)]
*  great again slogan. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=205.56s)]
*  Here's one of these China-linked accounts described by these researchers promoting that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=209.12s)]
*  Trump video over the weekend that showed an image of President Biden tied up hand and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=213.72s)]
*  foot as if you were being kidnapped or held hostage. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=218.28s)]
*  Here's another one of the China-linked accounts showing a different video, one for Easter. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=222.88s)]
*  It's an animated video that shows President Biden being assaulted and beaten up by a giant [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=229.04s)]
*  Easter bunny. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=234.8s)]
*  And I'm not going to show you the video because it's violence against the president of the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=236.28s)]
*  United States. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=239.04s)]
*  And yeah, it's for Easter. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=240.6s)]
*  Isn't that great? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=241.6s)]
*  Here's the president falling down and looking hurt and being pummeled. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=242.6s)]
*  The New York Times reporting that researchers have linked this new activity to a quote, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  long running network of accounts connected with the Chinese government. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=253.0s)]
*  The accounts are not always great at disguising the fact that they're actually Chinese. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=258.04s)]
*  Like in this instance where they're trying to look like an American account, you see [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=261.76s)]
*  the name at the top there with the little eagle and the American flags. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=265.44s)]
*  It says, Liam, Republican Party, America first, the American flags, the American eagle. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=269.4s)]
*  And this post is an attempt by this account to reply to a Trump video with basically a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=276.64s)]
*  big, a big attaboy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=283.32s)]
*  75 million Trump fans can't be wrong. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=284.84s)]
*  The problem with this is that they forgot they weren't supposed to be typing in Chinese. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=287.64s)]
*  They weren't supposed to be typing in Mandarin. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=291.52s)]
*  So it's only the Google Translate that tells you what it says. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  Oops. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=296.59999999999997s)]
*  So if you're trying to be Liam, Republican Party, American first, maybe toggle back to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=297.6s)]
*  English before you post your compliments to President Trump. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, which has done some of the research quoted [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  in the New York Times today, particularly about these, this campaign's operations on [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=311.3s)]
*  Facebook, also notes that the influence operation appears to be active almost exclusively during [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  business hours in China, during business hours Beijing time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=319.76000000000005s)]
*  All their posts appear here in for us, what are the overnight hours? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=323.88s)]
*  But those hours correspond to the work starting at 850 a.m. Beijing time, stopping at 6 p.m. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=329.44s)]
*  Beijing time with an hour off for lunch from noon to one local time during which they don't [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=337.12s)]
*  post at all. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=342.28s)]
*  So these are accounts and users that are occasionally lapsing into Chinese or forgetting to turn [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=345.48s)]
*  off the settings that show that their web browsers are set to operate in Mandarin. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=352.0s)]
*  They're operating on Chinese business hours, including a nice solid hour for Chinese lunch. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=356.4s)]
*  They appear pretty obviously linked to Chinese government influence operations. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  But what they're doing now this year is trying to mess with our election to try to help Trump [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=368.08s)]
*  get back in there and to hurt Joe Biden's chances. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  It's like Russia has been doing since 2016. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=378.8s)]
*  And the Trump years have shown us thus far that we have proven to be, forgive me, but [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  we have proven to be not just inept, but spineless when it comes to putting up with this from [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=392.88s)]
*  one authoritarian country that wants the worst for us. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=399.56s)]
*  What are we going to do now that it's two of them at once? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=402.56s)]
*  We're going to do it with polling for Trump. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=407.6s)]
*  Joining us now is Tiffany Xu. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=410.6s)]
*  She's a technology reporter at the New York Times who's reported out this and other stories [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=412.6s)]
*  on the same topic. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=416.04s)]
*  Ms. Xu, thank you very much for being here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=417.04s)]
*  I appreciate your time. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=419.04s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=420.04s)]
*  So what is the evidence, as you understand it, that this appears to be linked to not [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=422.04s)]
*  just operators in China, but to the Chinese state? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=428.04s)]
*  Well, like you said, there have been some slip ups in these accounts. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=432.04s)]
*  These accounts are many, many years old. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=436.92s)]
*  And for a while, they post exclusively in Mandarin. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=438.92s)]
*  The narrative is very pro-Beijing. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=441.92s)]
*  It lapses at some point into America is bad. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=443.92s)]
*  All of this is in Mandarin. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=447.92s)]
*  And then they go quiet for a few months and then suddenly reemerge, posting as Liam or [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=449.92s)]
*  Ben, MAGA all the way, I'm a husband, father, I'm 43 years old, I'm living in Los Angeles. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=455.92s)]
*  So these are very convincing accounts that are masquerading as Americans, posting entirely [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=462.8s)]
*  in English. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=468.8s)]
*  So they adopt these personalities that unless you're a researcher or a journalist and your [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=469.8s)]
*  entire job is to look for clues that you're not an authentic account, for the average [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=475.8s)]
*  social media users, you're like, yeah, this is a person who supports President Trump just [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=480.8s)]
*  like me. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=485.8s)]
*  I'm going to listen into what they have to say. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=486.8s)]
*  I've been focusing in trying to understand this on some of the elements of it that are [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=490.68s)]
*  ham-handed or that appear to be mistakes, letting it slip, accidentally showing that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=495.68s)]
*  your browser is set to Mandarin or sometimes accidentally posting in Mandarin. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=500.68s)]
*  That interesting detail that was identified by the Foundation for Defending Democracies [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=504.68s)]
*  about them posting mostly on Beijing time except not during their lunch hour. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=508.68s)]
*  I've been focusing on the things that kind of show it to be Chinese operations. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  But as you're saying, some of these personalities and some of the idiom they're using can be [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=518.56s)]
*  sort of convincing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=521.56s)]
*  Are they getting better at this? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=523.56s)]
*  Are these things improving over time in terms of their ability to masquerade as Americans? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=525.56s)]
*  Oh, leaps and bounds beyond what the Chinese used to be capable of. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=531.56s)]
*  I mean, if the Russians are seen as being ham-handed, they're like the teenager who's [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=535.56s)]
*  like, oh, mom, yeah, I was totally studying at the library and not drinking at a party [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=540.56s)]
*  with my friends. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=545.64s)]
*  Then the Chinese for a long time were the toddler who was covered in paint saying, no, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=546.64s)]
*  mommy, I didn't just paint the entire wall like you told me not to, like very, very enthusiastic [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=551.64s)]
*  but very see-through. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=556.64s)]
*  But what they're doing now is a step change in their capabilities. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=559.64s)]
*  The Chinese used to spread this narrative that was very pro-Beijing. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=564.64s)]
*  It was very much, this is the Beijing party line. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=568.64s)]
*  China is great. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=572.64s)]
*  They're trying to back all of our policies and our philosophies. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=574.72s)]
*  A couple of years ago, they shifted to Beijing is good, but America is also bad. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=577.72s)]
*  And so you see them start getting involved in the American culture wars, trying to weigh [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=583.72s)]
*  in on gay rights, on crime in the U.S. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=589.72s)]
*  But what they're doing now is focusing on specific candidates, which is not something [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=593.72s)]
*  most researchers have seen them do. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=598.72s)]
*  They're adopting these personalities that seem like real Americans and they're trying [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  to and often successfully generate real engagement from real people. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=605.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, one of these accounts was retweeted by Alex Jones. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=610.8000000000001s)]
*  He has 2.2 million followers. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=613.8000000000001s)]
*  So the idea that people, including people who have huge audiences, are interpreting [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  these accounts as real voices is pretty concerning to people who've looked at the world. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=622.8000000000001s)]
*  China as kind of an inept influence operator for a long time. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's concerning not only that it's working, but it's concerning to have what [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=634.8000000000001s)]
*  appears to be a state-directed effort like this focused in this way at this time ahead [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  of the election. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=646.8000000000001s)]
*  It really does feel like we haven't learned much. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=647.8000000000001s)]
*  But I learned a lot about it from you today and from this reporting. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=649.8000000000001s)]
*  I hope you'll come back and talk to us about this as you continue this work. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  It's fascinating and important stuff. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDTwQy9teI&t=654.8000000000001s)]
