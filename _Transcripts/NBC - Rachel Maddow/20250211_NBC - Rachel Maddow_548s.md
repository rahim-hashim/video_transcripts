# New reporting exposes shocking extent of Musk's conflicts as he dismantles U.S. government
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw)
*  So last night we talked about a sort of worryingly long list of actions the new administration has taken that just happened to benefit the president's top campaign donor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=0.0s)]
*  Everything from cutting the competition for Elon Musk's EV charging stations to firing investigators who were looking into his refusal to reveal his contacts with foreign governments. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=12.0s)]
*  Well today the New York Times is out with new reporting that makes that list a whole lot longer and may help explain even more of some of the inexplicable firings and shutdowns that the administration seems to have prioritized in these first three weeks that they've been in power. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=25.0s)]
*  For instance, we've talked here on the show about how Trump has has hamstrung agencies that deal with workers rights, including the National Labor Relations Board and the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=39.0s)]
*  Why did he go after those agencies? Well, he fired top officials at those agencies and didn't replace them. That makes it impossible for those agencies to do their job. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=51.0s)]
*  Why did he do that? Why do we understand why that got a priority action from this administration? Well, I don't know. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=62.0s)]
*  But the Times reports today that those agencies are handling two dozen workers rights investigations and at least one big lawsuit alleging racial harassment at Elon Musk's companies. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=68.0s)]
*  Ah, in similar fashion, Trump has also fired FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, Federal Elections Commission, that effectively shuts down the FEC, which polices campaign finance violations. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=80.0s)]
*  May be helpful to know that that's the same FEC that was overseeing complaints from this last election about Elon Musk giving people million dollar checks to, quote, encourage voter registration. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=95.0s)]
*  A lottery that he held, even though it is illegal to pay people to register to vote. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=108.0s)]
*  Last week, we brought you the story of Phyllis Fong, the Inspector General for the Department of Agriculture. She was fired by Donald Trump. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=115.0s)]
*  You might remember her story. She, after she was fired, nevertheless showed up to work the next day anyway, saying my firing was illegal and so I'm going to work. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=123.0s)]
*  They marched her out of the office, apparently. Well, it turns out in 2022, Phyllis Fong, quote, opened an investigation into Elon Musk's brain implant startup company, Neuralink, stemming from allegations that Musk's company had, quote, mistreated dozens of test monkeys. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=132.0s)]
*  Mistreatment that Elon Musk himself denies. Why was it so important to fire the Inspector General of USDA as one of your first actions? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=150.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know, but that's what she was doing to bother Elon Musk. Trump has also fired the head of the Office of Government Ethics. That is the agency tasked with investigating right now whether or not the Doge Project is itself a conflict of interest for Elon Musk. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=160.0s)]
*  Again, we don't know what is motivating or setting the priority list for this new administration in its first three weeks, but there is a lot of overlap between the administration has done and what you might imagine is a wish list for the next three weeks. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=175.0s)]
*  Or the president's top campaign donor who's been allowed to essentially have his way with the federal government, including a lot of elements of the federal government that were complicating his business life or cramping his style. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=190.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Eric Lipton, investigative reporter for the New York Times. Lead byline on that investigation into Elon Musk's companies and their interactions with these agencies that have been hamstrung and attacked by the administration. Mr. Lipton, I appreciate you being here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=202.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=215.0s)]
*  So I spotlighted some of the things that you reported today in the Times. Let me ask if I misconstrued any of those or if there are any other examples that you turned up that you feel like our audience should know about. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=216.0s)]
*  What we did was we sort of examined the breadth of Elon Musk operations across the federal government. And there are, you know, there are so many pending investigations, lawsuits, inquiries, and we looked at how many of them have been disrupted. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=230.0s)]
*  And we were quite surprised at how many cases we saw where, you know, we don't know. We never saw any evidence of Musk explicitly reaching in and, you know, using his clowder powers to stop any particular investigation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=245.0s)]
*  But what we saw was that again and again, agencies that are targeting his companies have now had significant disruptions. The inspector generals, the quorums are gone. They can't therefore process any potential new lawsuits or settlements. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=259.0s)]
*  And, you know, it just shows you how never before have we had a situation where someone has basically $13 billion worth of federal contracts over the last five years, $3.8 billion just in 2024, and at the same time has, you know, dozens of ongoing investigations that that same person would be given such incredible clout over the federal government. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=275.0s)]
*  And that is a conflict of interest. And now we're seeing a lot of people who are not interested in the federal government. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=290.0s)]
*  And that is a conflict of interest. And now we're seeing the implications of that where there are more than dozens of investigations that have been potentially disrupted because of the broad disruption that's happening in the federal government. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=302.0s)]
*  And that's something that we really felt we needed to drill down on and understand and identify as many cases as possible where these disruptions have occurred. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=316.0s)]
*  And that's what we published in today's paper. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=325.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, I know I'm just sort of cheerleading for your reporting here, but the examples that you found and that you document are really blunt. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=327.0s)]
*  I mean, you say that you didn't find examples of him reaching in and directing the end of an investigation. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=336.0s)]
*  But like, take, for example, him wanting to expand Twitter X so that it also involves a payment system. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=342.0s)]
*  That is something that would be regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, by the CPFB. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=348.0s)]
*  He announces that our CFPB, he announces that a few weeks ago, then gets handed control of a big portion of the U.S. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=353.0s)]
*  government and then announces CFPB RIP, in effect, claiming credit for personally killing that agency, which takes the agency off the board as a potential regulator for this thing he has just announced he wants to do with his business. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=362.0s)]
*  I mean, I know that the I know that some of there's a lot of acronyms here and I know that financial conflicts of interest sound like a sort of esoteric thing. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=377.0s)]
*  But this is like a cartoon Western level of of of cartoon Western explication in terms of the simplicity of how much his actions here have benefited his own business interests. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=386.0s)]
*  I just feel like it's very, very, very clear. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=404.0s)]
*  Yeah, I really I mean, I've been a reporter for three decades, more than three decades. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=407.0s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=411.0s)]
*  I've never seen such a blatant conflict of interest. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=413.0s)]
*  He is one of the largest contractors for the federal government. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=417.0s)]
*  Again, fifteen billion dollars in contracts just in the last decade. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=421.0s)]
*  And the notion that an individual who could be, you know, running or founding or operating, you know, so many companies that have so many contracts with the federal government and at the same time, you know, deciding what the budgets of the federal agency should be or what regulatory powers they should have and even what investigative and enforcement powers they should have. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=426.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, the thing is that even before the election, Musk was very clear that he had intense frustration with the Federal Aviation Administration, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=447.0s)]
*  He wanted the the FAA administrator fired. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=458.0s)]
*  He called the SEC political and he was very pointed in the Department of Interior. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=461.0s)]
*  He was very frustrated with he he blamed all of these agencies for, you know, we're never going to get humans to Mars at this pace. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=468.0s)]
*  And it was very clear that he wanted to have the ability to to to, you know, to clash with these regulators and to rein them in. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=476.0s)]
*  And now he has that power. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=484.0s)]
*  And now these same agencies are having their powers curtail. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=486.0s)]
*  Now, again, we don't have evidence that he has directly reached in, but there is a correlation that that needed to be called out. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=490.0s)]
*  And we've now called it out. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=497.0s)]
*  Eric Lipton, investigative reporter for The New York Times. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=499.0s)]
*  Thank you for your reporting on this. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=502.0s)]
*  Thanks for your clarity and for making time tonight to help us understand it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=504.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=507.0s)]
*  It really is like, you know, if you were if you were a bank robber and you also had the power to zero out the budget of the police department that was otherwise going to arrest you for robbing the bank. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=510.0s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=523.0s)]
*  It's not complicated. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=525.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gESbfgDRozw&t=534.0s)]
