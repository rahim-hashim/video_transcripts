# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: May 15
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM)
*  They wore their little masks and they had their little shields and they held upside-down American flags. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=0.0s)]
*  This is once again the white supremacist glee club that calls itself Patriot Front. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=5.0s)]
*  They marched this weekend in D.C. trying to intimidate people, chanting racist slogans. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=10.0s)]
*  And a local D.C. man named Joe Flood heard that they were out there, heard that that was happening. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=16.0s)]
*  When he heard that they were out there in his city, he hopped on a bike and he went to go try to find them on the National Mall. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=23.0s)]
*  You can see Mr. Flood there on the right. He's got the red bike standing near the group. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=29.0s)]
*  Mr. Flood told us when he found them today he felt suddenly that it was his duty to say something. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=33.0s)]
*  So he did. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=38.0s)]
*  There is simply no time. There will be no memory of America to continue. No history to fight for. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=42.0s)]
*  You are the losers of your height. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=53.0s)]
*  You have gone out into this swamp of Americans, of caste adrift, of not even watching, with all those different types of pants on. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=55.0s)]
*  The city is not turned in waste. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=64.0s)]
*  Reclaim your virginity. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=67.0s)]
*  Mr. Flood told us, quote, this guy was giving the speech. He kept having to stop and pull it out of his pocket and then start reading it again. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=70.0s)]
*  So every time he stopped I would yell at him and say he was boring. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=76.0s)]
*  And then I said, why can't you memorize your speech? Why can't you memorize your speech? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=80.0s)]
*  And then I said, you look like General Custer's illegitimate son. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=83.0s)]
*  The guy sighed and looked at me and I thought, I got you. I got in your head. Now get out of my town. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=89.0s)]
*  The white supremacist group eventually left DC this weekend, but not before Joe Flood took up permanent residence in the heart of the city. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=96.0s)]
*  A second thing we are keeping an eye on tonight is the reaction, particularly the reaction on the political right to the long awaited Durham report. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=106.0s)]
*  What? The long awaited what? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=115.0s)]
*  Well, the reason we're watching for the right and their reaction to this is because the Durham report is only really long awaited by them. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=118.0s)]
*  And they really, really have been awaiting this report. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=126.0s)]
*  A source close to special counsel John Durham's probe tells Fox News things have, quote, accelerated. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=130.0s)]
*  I look forward to bull Durham's report. That's the one I look forward to. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=137.0s)]
*  Did you think by now that there would have been more to come out of the Durham investigation? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=144.0s)]
*  What happened to Durham? Where's Durham? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=151.0s)]
*  And by the way, where's Durham? What happened? Where is he? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=153.0s)]
*  He disappeared. We do not yet know what the remainder of John Durham's findings are. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=159.0s)]
*  Actually, now we finally do know. Boy, they have been excited about this for a long time. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=165.0s)]
*  Literally for years, former President Trump and his allies have been invoking the name John Durham or sometimes bull Durham as the man who would save them and smite all of Trump's enemies. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=170.0s)]
*  For years, they have been heralding the great revelations John Durham would soon reveal about Trump's political opponents and the deep state and all their evil ways. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=183.0s)]
*  When that didn't seem to be happening, Trump and his allies started pounding their chests and yelling at the clouds about why Durham hadn't acted yet, why he hadn't yet smote all of Trump's enemies, why, you know, there were Democrats who weren't yet at Guantanamo. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=193.0s)]
*  Durham will do it all. John Durham was appointed by Trump Attorney General Bill Barr. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=209.0s)]
*  His assignment from Bill Barr was to prove that when Russia launched its operation to intervene in the U.S. presidential election in 2016 to try to help Trump win, Durham was supposed to prove in this investigation that the FBI was wrong to have investigated whether the Trump campaign itself was connected to what Russia was doing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=215.0s)]
*  For four long years, John Durham's supposedly bombshell findings were always tantalizingly close. The damning evidence was going to come any day. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=239.0s)]
*  It has really never worked out the way they hoped. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=249.0s)]
*  In some total, what John Durham got out of his investigation was one guilty plea out of an FBI lawyer, an FBI employee who admitted he made a misrepresentation in a single email. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=253.0s)]
*  It should also be noted, though, that that lawyer's screw up was discovered not by John Durham, but by an entirely different investigation that had nothing to do with John Durham. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=267.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, that FBI employee did plead guilty to making a misrepresentation in a single email, and his punishment was that he had to do some hours of community service. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=276.0s)]
*  But that was kind of it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=287.0s)]
*  Last year, John Durham finally did bring two criminal cases to court stemming from his investigation. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=290.0s)]
*  He lost both of those cases in very quick acquittals. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=296.0s)]
*  In one of those two cases, the former woman of the jury actually came out of the courtroom after the case and told reporters outside that the trial had not been worth the effort. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=301.0s)]
*  She said, quote, I think we could have spent our time more wisely. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=310.0s)]
*  After the second not guilty verdict, this was the AP's headline, quote, Trump's claim of crime of the century fizzles in three year probe. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=315.0s)]
*  But that was OK, because that was only year three. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=325.0s)]
*  And the smoking gun was going to be in Durham's report, which we know now would come out in year four. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=328.0s)]
*  The report was still coming. Right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=334.0s)]
*  John Durham's failed cases in court. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=336.0s)]
*  They were all just part of the deep state conspiracy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=338.0s)]
*  When he finally put the report out, all would be revealed. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=341.0s)]
*  Today, at long last, we have the report. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=344.0s)]
*  Here's the AP's headline today. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=348.0s)]
*  Prosecutor ends probe of FBI's Trump Russia investigation with harsh criticism, but no new charges. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=352.0s)]
*  Quote, the report Monday from special counsel John Durham represents the long awaited culmination of an investigation that Trump and his allies had claimed would expose massive wrongdoing by law enforcement and intelligence officials. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=359.0s)]
*  Instead, Durham's investigation delivered underwhelming results. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=371.0s)]
*  Nearly four years, more than six million dollars in taxpayer funds. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=377.0s)]
*  And today's report, now that we've got it, 300 plus pages. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=381.0s)]
*  It's just a rehash of stuff we already knew with Durham criticizing the FBI for launching that investigation, but presenting no new evidence that they actually did anything wrong. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=385.0s)]
*  And so it is worth keeping an eye on the reaction to this report today on the right, because who knows how they're going to react. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=398.0s)]
*  They do seem kind of trapped in this hype, let down, hype, let down cycle. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=406.0s)]
*  Just a few days ago, the Republican chairman of the Oversight Committee, you may remember he held this big press conference to announce the bombshell corruption evidence he had turned up about President Biden. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=409.0s)]
*  How did that go? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=420.0s)]
*  Well, this was the headline in the New York Times about that press conference. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=422.0s)]
*  Quote, House Republican report finds no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=425.0s)]
*  After months of investigation and many public accusations of corruption against Mr. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=430.0s)]
*  Biden and his family, the first report of the premier House Republican inquiry into such matters showed no proof of such misconduct. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=434.0s)]
*  But that's OK. That's OK. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=443.0s)]
*  There's still more to come. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=445.0s)]
*  This weekend, the same chairman, the House Oversight Committee chairman, said his investigation still has more evidence. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=446.0s)]
*  OK, there might not have been anything in that report last week, but there's more. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=453.0s)]
*  He said he has an informant on all of Biden's corruption. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=456.0s)]
*  Only he admitted to Fox News this weekend. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=459.0s)]
*  He has temporarily misplaced the informant. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=462.0s)]
*  He cannot find him anymore. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=465.0s)]
*  Seems possible he might have left him on the top of the car when he pulled out of the driveway and just disappeared. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=468.0s)]
*  It's got to be here somewhere. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=473.0s)]
*  Can't find the man anywhere. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=475.0s)]
*  His Carol's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, says she and her client are currently weighing whether or not to bring yet another defamation suit against Donald Trump, this time for the new iterations he made of these lies on television in the immediate wake of the verdict. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=480.0s)]
*  For the first time since he was elected president, E.J. Carol and her lawyer, Robbie Kaplan, have proven in a court of law that Trump cannot tell lies with impunity. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=494.0s)]
*  They have done that for the country. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=503.0s)]
*  They were not the first to try, but they were the first to succeed, to hold Trump accountable by the American judicial system. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=505.0s)]
*  First time anybody has been able to do that since he was elected president. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=512.0s)]
*  They've already done that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=516.0s)]
*  Now they have to decide what to do next. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=518.0s)]
*  Joining us now for the interview is E.J. Carol and her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=521.0s)]
*  It is very nice to have you both here. Thank you. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=525.0s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=527.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm sorry I made you sit through that whole thing about the attack in Virginia and the Durham report. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=528.0s)]
*  I just want to stand up and give you a standing ovation. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=533.0s)]
*  I hadn't realized that nobody had done this, that we're the first. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=536.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=544.0s)]
*  I just realized it when you said it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=545.0s)]
*  Yeah, you, Robbie. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=548.0s)]
*  You did it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=550.0s)]
*  And we as a country are inured to the idea not just that politicians tell lies, right? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=552.0s)]
*  We're inured to the specific thing with Mr. Trump in which he lies about even checkable things. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=559.0s)]
*  And he lies in ways that are very hurtful, that are designed to ruin people's lives. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=566.0s)]
*  And there's no consequences for it. All he does is benefit. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=571.0s)]
*  Cruelty makes him seem stronger. Cruelty makes him seem more macho. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=573.0s)]
*  Cruelty makes his view, his adoring public adore him all the more. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=577.0s)]
*  You are the first people to have punctured that by using the legal system to say you have to be held accountable for what you say. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=582.0s)]
*  I was going to ask you how that felt, but you're only realizing it for the first time now. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=590.0s)]
*  Well, when the verdict came, I think we ascended to the ceiling. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=594.0s)]
*  You did. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=602.0s)]
*  And it was the happiest day of my life. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=603.0s)]
*  And on top of having the happiest day of our lives was added, we were so proud to be in America and see democracy actually work. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=606.0s)]
*  So to put that on top of our happiness, and Robbie was squeezed. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=618.0s)]
*  You see this hand is three times smaller than you see. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=622.0s)]
*  Squeeze it so hard. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=625.0s)]
*  It was thrilling. I could feel it in my very bones right down to my corpuscles. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=627.0s)]
*  And I still have that feeling. When you went through it again, I was again thrilled. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=635.0s)]
*  Let me ask about that question that I posited there. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=644.0s)]
*  You did force accountability, and then he did it again. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=648.0s)]
*  The defamation, the calling you a liar, the exact same things the jury held him liable for the day before. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=655.0s)]
*  He did again the next day on national television. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=661.0s)]
*  Is that just the way it has to be? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=663.0s)]
*  Do you think that potentially could be actionable if you were to file another suit? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=665.0s)]
*  Would it work the same way? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=669.0s)]
*  So it's definitely actionable. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=671.0s)]
*  And here the cruelty will make him less wealthy. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=673.0s)]
*  He's not going to get away with it another time. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=676.0s)]
*  It's unprecedented for a person to have been held liable in defamation to keep doing the defamation. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=679.0s)]
*  So there are not a lot of cases that we can look to for a playbook about how to do it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=687.0s)]
*  But suffice to say, I have a lot of lawyers who are very busy looking into this, and we are weighing all of our options. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=691.0s)]
*  You also have another live case from the time when he was president and he was stating these same untrue things about you, defaming you in the same way. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=699.0s)]
*  That case is still working its way through the courts. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=710.0s)]
*  What is your expectation in terms of what's going to happen there? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=713.0s)]
*  You're going to see news from us in that case very, very soon, Rachel. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=716.0s)]
*  What counts as very soon? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=719.0s)]
*  I don't know how late the people work tonight, two to three days max. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=721.0s)]
*  Wow. Okay. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=724.0s)]
*  But we're going to we're fully pursuing that case. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=726.0s)]
*  We got a nice, a very good decision from the D.C. Court of Appeals, essentially affirming Judge Kaplan that when Kaplan Trump said what he said about E.G. in 2019, he was not acting as president. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=728.0s)]
*  We're quite confident that that will be affirmed. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=739.0s)]
*  And then we'll be able to move forward with damages in that case. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=742.0s)]
*  We don't even need a finding a liability because we already have it. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=745.0s)]
*  And we'll be able to find damages. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=748.0s)]
*  And there the defamation damages are much higher because that was the first statement he made. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=750.0s)]
*  And that's what really destroyed her reputation as an advice columnist at Elle and to all her readers and people who who trusted her and looked up to her. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=754.0s)]
*  In terms of the timing here after those statements that are still at issue in this live case, as you mentioned, you were let go from Elle in terms of your job. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=762.0s)]
*  And you think that was related to his defamation? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=769.0s)]
*  Well, I know it was related. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=773.0s)]
*  Let me ask you, E.G., in terms of what you went through, there weren't cameras in the courtroom, but the whole country was following this word by word. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=775.0s)]
*  And we have the transcript and we know how your cross examination in particular went. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=783.0s)]
*  And I think anybody with a drop of empathy knows that must have been very painful. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=787.0s)]
*  But you must have known it was going to be painful in the first instance when you set out to try to get your day in court here. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=792.0s)]
*  Did things go the way that you thought they would? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=799.0s)]
*  Were they harder than you thought they would be? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=801.0s)]
*  Or were you more prepared for how they were going to go than you expected? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=804.0s)]
*  How did it how did it match up with your expectations and how you'd prepare? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=807.0s)]
*  I was ignorant. I had never sued anybody. I had never even been in a courtroom. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=812.0s)]
*  It was tough. But Robbie Kaplan, who I heard someone you might know say, when the history of this era is written, there'll be multiple chapters about Robbie Kaplan. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=818.0s)]
*  She and this brilliant team of lawyers had me so prepared, had me unbelievably prepared. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=832.0s)]
*  I went in because I was so ignorant, confident. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=841.0s)]
*  It was like getting hit by a board when Mr. Takapina did my cross examination. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=845.0s)]
*  But I really wasn't doing it for myself. I was doing it for the women in the country. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=854.0s)]
*  And I got very little sleep. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=859.0s)]
*  You slayed it though, E.G. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=867.0s)]
*  It was every day was exciting. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=869.0s)]
*  It's an incredible feeling to feel the waves across the country behind us. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=873.0s)]
*  And the end when I told what happened, I was heard. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=880.0s)]
*  I was heard in federal court. I was heard in federal court in front of a jury of my peers. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=890.0s)]
*  They weighed the evidence and the truth was established. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=898.0s)]
*  And the system works. It's amazing how this process worked after two weeks. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=903.0s)]
*  I was astounded that it actually worked. And the reason it worked is Robbie Kaplan. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=911.0s)]
*  It helps to have a good lawyer to make the system work for you. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=918.0s)]
*  But I mean, you had a jury of nine, six men and three women on a jury. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=922.0s)]
*  Once things are in the hands of the jury, you never know what each individual juror is bringing to those deliberations, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=926.0s)]
*  what their hang ups or own experiences or prejudices might be, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=932.0s)]
*  despite the fact that the process is designed to make sure you have a fair jury. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=935.0s)]
*  Clearly, this is a ruling that shook the former president. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=940.0s)]
*  The prospect of more accountability to come appears to be very unsettling to him. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=943.0s)]
*  I think it is creating a sort of wave across the country of people feeling like you are speaking for a lot of people and not just yourself. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=948.0s)]
*  But Robbie, you have sued this former president a lot. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=955.0s)]
*  And you have been the point of the spear for some of the legal accountability that he seems least able to handle. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=959.0s)]
*  And I wonder how that's changed your life. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=966.0s)]
*  Well, he doesn't like me very much, that's for sure. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=969.0s)]
*  And he's kind of obsessed with the fact that my firm and some of the lawyers I work with have have other cases against him. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=972.0s)]
*  But I think in terms of my life, it's the same job, whether I'm suing Trump on behalf of Eugene or we're suing the Charlottesville Nazis or we're suing someone else. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=979.0s)]
*  The job is the same. It's to litigate the facts, to marshal the evidence, to convince a jury as we did in both cases. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=988.0s)]
*  And here we have the best possible plaintiff and possible client to tell her story, to speak her truth. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=996.0s)]
*  And as we said on our team, just let Eugene be Eugene. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1002.0s)]
*  And she was, and the jury loved her, as they should have. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1007.0s)]
*  Let me ask you as a matter of law and advocacy here. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1010.0s)]
*  This case has got me thinking about other people who have or may have defamation claims against the same former president. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1014.0s)]
*  People like the Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1021.0s)]
*  They have sued a few conservative media outlets and Rudy Giuliani for defamation. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1027.0s)]
*  They haven't sued the president himself. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1031.0s)]
*  But arguably they've got the same kind of case to be able to make against him. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1033.0s)]
*  Do you think the success of this case doesn't just buoy people who feel like finally accountability, finally truth being nailed to the wall and not led to slide down, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1037.0s)]
*  but doesn't have the potential to change the legal landscape for other civil cases against Trump? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1049.0s)]
*  I think it does because he's actually a very good defamation defendant if you're planning to sue for defamation, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1054.0s)]
*  because he lies all the time. He lies as a matter of habit. He lies about big things. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1061.0s)]
*  He lies about small things. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1066.0s)]
*  And in this case, we were able to show those lies not only about it being fake news and a hoax and a made up story, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1067.0s)]
*  but even when I showed him that famous photo where he mistook E.G. for Marla Maples, when he realized he'd made the mistake, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1075.0s)]
*  he then said the photo's blurry. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1084.0s)]
*  The photo was not blurry, but it was classic Donald Trump. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1085.0s)]
*  And I think the jury really heard that. They really absorbed it. And that's why we got a verdict in two and a half hours. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1088.0s)]
*  See, this is the reason that this is a bigger—I'm sorry to put it in these terms because I feel like I'm a little like casting a movie about it or something. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1094.0s)]
*  But you saying that it's a disadvantage that he lies so much, I feel like it's the first time I've heard that in seven years. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1102.0s)]
*  The ability to lie without shame and without any sort of tell, without any sort of remorse about it whatsoever, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1109.0s)]
*  and about even the most important things has always seemed like a political superpower to him. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1117.0s)]
*  You've turned it into the opposite by virtue of the court system. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1122.0s)]
*  He's revived defamation law. Donald Trump single-handedly. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1126.0s)]
*  E.G., let me just ask you one last question here. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1130.0s)]
*  I was struck by what you said about Trump's latest comments on CNN, and I know you didn't watch them live, which somehow gives me great comfort. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1133.0s)]
*  But you said his words wound people. You used the plural there. Not that they wound me or this is a way to wound women. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1139.0s)]
*  You're talking about the—I'm just struck by your use of the word people there, plural. What did you mean by that? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1149.0s)]
*  Remember when he came—I've seen now clips of the CNN town hall. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1156.0s)]
*  When he came on stage right after our enormous victory, and he made jokes about sexual assault, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1161.0s)]
*  I couldn't believe the pain he was causing to thousands of people by joking about sexual assault. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1173.0s)]
*  And that's how he hurts people. That's how he hurts people. And I'd love to have Robbie Kaplan just shut him up. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1183.0s)]
*  E.G. and Carol, Robbie Kaplan, thank you. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1191.0s)]
*  Thank you, Rachael. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1194.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. It's good to see you both. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1195.0s)]
*  Nice to see you. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1197.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2guHZZQy_CM&t=1213.0s)]
