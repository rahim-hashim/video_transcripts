# U.S. Aid To Ukraine Adjusts To Russian Threat; Longer Term Planning Considered
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc)
*  Joining us now is the Democratic-Colorado Congressman Jason Crowe, member of both the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=0.0s)]
*  Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=4.24s)]
*  He has served as an Army Ranger in both Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=6.94s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=10.52s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=12.64s)]
*  We just learned that the Biden administration will send another $100 million worth of these [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=13.68s)]
*  very effective Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=19.14s)]
*  But our first guest tonight, the member of parliament Alex Gonshurenko, told me that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=22.06s)]
*  Russian long-range attacks on these civilian populations are the reasons why Ukraine so [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=26.4s)]
*  desperately needs anti-tank, anti-aircraft defense more than anti-tank defense. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=32.44s)]
*  You've also made that argument. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=38.8s)]
*  Is the U.S. going to do it? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=40.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think the United States is going to do it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  I'm going to make something really clear. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=45.4s)]
*  The Biden administration has done a remarkable job providing a vast array of defensive weapons [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=46.76s)]
*  and material and equipment to the Ukrainians in a very short period of time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=53.0s)]
*  And there's a couple of reasons why the Ukrainians are having as much success on the battlefield [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=57.28s)]
*  that they are. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=60.84s)]
*  One is that they are fierce fighters and they're fighting for their life and their independence [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=62.84s)]
*  and their freedom. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=66.64s)]
*  They're doing a great job. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=67.64s)]
*  The second is we're giving them tremendous weapons, 21st century weapons. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=69.72s)]
*  We're doing so at a bright-necked pace. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=73.6s)]
*  And the third is we've been training them since 2014, giving them communications equipment [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  and the training to actually bring them to the battlefield and allow them to fight the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  way they are now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=85.6s)]
*  So the administration has done a great job, but wars change, wars evolve. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=86.6s)]
*  And this war has changed and evolved. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=92.28s)]
*  The Russians have adapted. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=93.92s)]
*  They're shifting their tactics. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=95.48s)]
*  They're shifting their location. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=96.76s)]
*  So our support has to adapt and evolve with it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  And that's what this letter is about. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=101.08s)]
*  This is not a critical letter. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=102.08s)]
*  We're not saying they haven't done enough. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=103.8s)]
*  We're saying that the next phase of this war will require an evolution, a change in both [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=105.56s)]
*  the quantity and the speed and the nature of the support that we provide. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=110.24s)]
*  Congressman, you're an Army Ranger. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  You served in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=117.8s)]
*  So you know the consequences of this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  How do you balance the Ukrainian request for more assistance, some of which, particularly [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=122.64s)]
*  with air defenses, Russia will take to be an act of war from NATO? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  How do you separate those things? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=135.16s)]
*  Because people warn that if you do that, you end up in World War III. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=136.88s)]
*  You end up in a direct war with Russia, a hot war that then could involve nuclear weapons. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=139.92s)]
*  Tell me how you think about this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=145.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so how I think about it is we're not going to implement a no-fly zone because that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=146.64s)]
*  would require US fighter jets shooting down Russian fighter jets over the Ukrainian skies. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=151.76s)]
*  And we're not going to send NATO or US troops to fight on the ground in Russia. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=156.32s)]
*  So short of those things, there are many, many other things we can do. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=160.64s)]
*  We can pretty much provide most things that they're asking for over some period of time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=163.92s)]
*  We don't do it all right now because they have to have the logistics. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  They have to be able to sustain it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=171.28s)]
*  They have to be able to have the supply lines. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  They have to be able to be trained on those systems. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=174.56s)]
*  We have to make sure that these are systems that won't fall into the hands of the Russians [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  or be captured either. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=180.0s)]
*  So we're balancing all those considerations. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=181.64s)]
*  But most of the things we can give them, I think, over some period of time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=183.32s)]
*  They have provided a list, the United States government, a list of 17 items prioritized [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=187.11999999999998s)]
*  in order, 1 through 17. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=191.6s)]
*  The top items in that list are things that they need and can implement right now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=194.2s)]
*  They can put into effect on the battlefield today. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=198.04s)]
*  As you go down that list, this is longer term things, fighter jets, tanks, other material [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  that requires some sustainment, some supply lines, some training that maybe they don't [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  have. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=211.84s)]
*  But the administration has recognized what's happening here is the Ukrainians have to both [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=212.84s)]
*  now and they have to transition to a longer term fight as the Russians dig in and look [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=218.12s)]
*  at a kind of a war of attrition over a long period of time. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=224.24s)]
*  So we have to do both. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=226.76s)]
*  The Ukrainians understand that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=227.76s)]
*  And our aid has to be able to balance both the short term and the long term. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=230.04s)]
*  It's hard to think about a long term when you see the images that we've all watched [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  this weekend of these atrocities. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=240.24s)]
*  We appreciate that people like you with real experience on the battlefield and in government [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=242.42000000000002s)]
*  understand how to discuss them. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=247.82000000000002s)]
*  Democratic Colorado Congressman Jason Crowe is a member of both the Armed Services and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=249.66000000000003s)]
*  the Intelligence Committee. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=252.86s)]
*  Sir, we appreciate you joining us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=253.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgqjDDvt-hc&t=255.74s)]
