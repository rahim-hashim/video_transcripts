# Rachel Maddow on the nitty gritty of the next steps in sentencing Donald Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o)
*  Now that Trump has been found guilty, one of the things we've been talking about, Joy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=0.0s)]
*  you're raising this with me in your conversation with Mary as well, is the next step in the process, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=3.84s)]
*  of course, sentencing. Trump's sentencing hearing has been set. It'll be July 11th at 10 a.m. Eastern. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=8.24s)]
*  Until then, Trump has bail conditions, of course, because he's a criminal defendant. His bail [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=15.6s)]
*  conditions have not changed. He's still out on his own recognizance without bail. So he's free to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  move about the country the way he wants to. But he was found guilty today on all 34 counts that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=25.92s)]
*  he was charged with. And each of those counts, in terms of the sentencing, carries with it the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=31.360000000000003s)]
*  possibility of up to four years in prison. Judge Marshawn is likely, if he does impose any prison [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=35.84s)]
*  sentence, he's likely to impose sentences concurrently. That means that he wouldn't [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=44.08s)]
*  be stacking up four years and then four years and then four years and then four years. That would [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=48.64s)]
*  mean that Trump would be serving each of his up to four-year sentences simultaneously, not as a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=52.24s)]
*  136-year string of back-to-back sentences. In terms of whether he actually will be incarcerated, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=57.36s)]
*  whether he'll end up behind bars in a prison somewhere, that is unclear. It's not necessarily [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=63.6s)]
*  required by any means. Judge Marshawn could impose a sentence of probation with no prison [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=69.44s)]
*  time involved. That would still mean Trump would become the first former president required to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  regularly report to a probation officer. It could mean that the bar for him to be jailed if he [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=78.64s)]
*  committed other crimes in the future could be lowered to the floor. Him being on probation [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=84.0s)]
*  would mean the ability to jail Trump would effectively be instantly effectuateable if he [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=91.6s)]
*  committed any other crimes, which is a weird way to live, let alone a weird way to live as a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=98.48s)]
*  presidential candidate or indeed potentially a president. All of that, how Trump's sentence will [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=103.68s)]
*  eventually physically manifest and restrain him in one way or the other, all of that is likely far [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=112.4s)]
*  off. Trump will almost certainly appeal the verdict today. That appeals process will almost definitely [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  push all of this past the election. Being found guilty does not bar you from running for president. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  What does Trump's sentencing mean in terms of what actually happens before the election? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=130.0s)]
*  Practically speaking, it means that Trump will be back in a Manhattan courtroom with the news of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=135.11999999999998s)]
*  these 34 guilty verdicts back on the front pages across the country at his sentencing hearing on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  July 11th, four days after that on July 15th, unless the Republican Party changes course. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=144.72s)]
*  That'll be the start of the Republican National Convention that will nominate him for the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=151.12s)]
*  presidency. Joining us now is somebody who has direct experience with these matters. She's a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=156.24s)]
*  former assistant district attorney in the Manhattan district attorney's office. Catherine Christian, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=161.12s)]
*  Catherine, thanks for being with us on this. Let me ask if I've explained those basics of what comes [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=165.44s)]
*  next, the probation report, the sentencing phase and what we can likely expect from that phase. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=172.08s)]
*  Is that all correct as you understand it? It's correct, except you probably see [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump's lawyers file a motion to set aside the verdict, which is allowed before sentencing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=184.24s)]
*  It's under the criminal procedure law, it's a 330 motion. So that could delay the sentence [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=189.52s)]
*  because they're going to file it and then of course the prosecution will have a chance to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=194.96s)]
*  respond to it and then Judge Machan will make a decision on that. So that often will delay the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=198.96s)]
*  sentence. Everything else, the probation, and probation doesn't mean he's getting probation, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=205.36s)]
*  they're just the ones tasked with doing the report for the sentencing, for the judge to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=210.4s)]
*  determine what is the appropriate sentencing. So except for that one little filing of the motion [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=216.0s)]
*  to set aside the verdict, it will go according to how it always is for regular defendants. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=221.44s)]
*  And that filing of the motion to set aside the verdict, that's separate from and in addition to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=228.72s)]
*  the oral motion that we heard in the court today after the jury verdict where [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=234.56s)]
*  Todd Blanch on Trump's behalf asked for an acquittal. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=239.28s)]
*  Yeah and it's unclear because I was literally in the subway when my phone blew up. He had originally, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=242.56s)]
*  you recall, moved for what's called a trial order of dismissal and the judge reserved decision on [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=250.24s)]
*  that. So it's unclear whether the judge finally said denied, but that's also outstanding. But in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=256.56s)]
*  addition they can file now that the verdict is in a motion to set aside the verdict. And then when [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=263.04s)]
*  that is denied, which it ultimately will be, and he's sentenced, then their appeal will be filed. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  In terms of the appeals process and the sentencing process, as you said the sentencing [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=274.72s)]
*  will go ahead in anticipation of his filing the appeal. They won't delay the sentencing to follow, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=280.56s)]
*  to come at the end of the appeals process? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the sentencing comes before appeal. In fact, you can't file your notice of appeal until you [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=289.68s)]
*  have now been sentenced and it's official he is now sentenced, convicted, felon of 34 accounts. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=294.08s)]
*  And then he files the notice of appeal and assuming his lawyers, whoever's going to do the appeal, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=300.8s)]
*  responds on time and gets the filings in, I believe the appellate division, which is called [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=307.12s)]
*  the Appellate Division First Department here, will decide that appeal probably by January or [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=312.08s)]
*  February of 2025. Again, assuming that everything is done on time by the parties, the court is [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=317.6s)]
*  ready, but the parties have to file their briefs and do everything they're supposed to do on time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  If he is elected president in the election in November and that appeal, as you said, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  would otherwise in the normal course be expected maybe in January by 2020, January 2025, do you [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  think that his election as president has an anticipatable effect in terms of how the Appellate [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=341.76s)]
*  Division will handle this matter? I don't think so at all. Remember, this is state and they will [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=350.0s)]
*  decide that either the jury was right and your conviction has been affirmed and then he will [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=356.08s)]
*  get a chance to try to appeal to the higher court in New York. The highest court is called the Court [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=363.68s)]
*  of Appeals. So they're going to treat him like any other defendant who files an appeal and files [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=368.56s)]
*  everything on time. Is the appeals process like the process that we just saw in Judge [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=375.84s)]
*  Vershawn's courtroom, one for which the defendant has to be president? No. President, not president. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  No, he has a right to, but he does not have to be president. In fact, defendants usually aren't [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=389.12s)]
*  present at the appellate court when their appeals are argued. They have a right to, but he won't be [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=394.16s)]
*  there. One last specific question. On the probation department, they prepare a report, essentially an [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=399.76000000000005s)]
*  internal report or is it public facing, that's essentially meant to help the judge and the judge's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=408.08000000000004s)]
*  decision on the sentence. What can you tell us about that? Well, it's filed and it's still kind [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  of old school in the criminal term in Manhattan. It's filed with the court. It's called the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=419.36s)]
*  investigation and sentencing period and then the sentencing report was filed. Both the defense will [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=425.2s)]
*  get it, the prosecutor will get it, the court will get it and ultimately that report is in the file, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=431.04s)]
*  the official court file. Katherine Christian, absolutely, absolutely essential to have you [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=435.68s)]
*  with us here tonight. Thank you so much. Much appreciated. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=442.64s)]
*  you [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNY8ES1sH6o&t=449.36s)]
