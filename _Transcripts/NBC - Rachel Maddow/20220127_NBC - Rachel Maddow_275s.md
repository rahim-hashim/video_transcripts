Video Description: Rachel Maddow reports on the bizarre, impassioned insistence by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis that Covid patients have access to monoclonal antibody treatments that everyone who knows what they're talking about agree do not work against the omicron variant, which make up 99% of the current cases.

# DeSantis Unable To Adapt As Covid Conditions Change; Clings To Obsolete Treatments
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw)
*  This week, Governor DeSantis unleashed this furious tirade against the Biden administration, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=0.0s)]
*  blasting President Biden and the administration for stopping shipments of two monoclonal antibody [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=4.72s)]
*  treatments for COVID. Governor DeSantis called that a sudden and reckless decision and accused [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=10.48s)]
*  the Biden administration of basically killing people, blocking life-saving treatments. He said [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  he's going to fight back against this decision. What is so strange about this explosion of rage [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=21.04s)]
*  from Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, is that the reason the federal government stopped sending [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=27.2s)]
*  those two particular monoclonal antibody treatments to Florida and all the other states in the country [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  is that those two monoclonal antibodies do not work against the Omicron variant. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=37.2s)]
*  Those two monoclonal antibodies have been a fantastic treatment for previous variants of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=44.72s)]
*  COVID. They have saved lots and lots of lives, but they do not work against Omicron. Omicron is [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  mutated in such a way that it is not susceptible to those treatments. The drug makers themselves [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=56.24s)]
*  say they have done the tests and those monoclonal antibody treatments don't work against Omicron, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=61.92s)]
*  and Omicron now makes up 99% of new cases of COVID across the country, including Florida. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=66.48s)]
*  You do not have to be a chemist to understand this. It is not that hard to understand. If you [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=71.84s)]
*  are four years old and listening to me right now, you probably understand what I just said. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=77.76s)]
*  There is one monoclonal antibody from Glastso Smith-Kline that does still work against Omicron. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=82.08s)]
*  That drug is unfortunately in very short supply right now, and they're struggling to make more [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=89.2s)]
*  of it as fast as they can. But from those other two companies, from Regeneron and Eli Lilly, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=92.96s)]
*  their antibody treatments, while they worked on earlier iterations of the coronavirus, they do [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  not work on the current one. Again, this is easy. This is not even like math. This is like counting [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=102.48s)]
*  on your fingers territory. But in Florida, they apparently cannot get that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=107.92s)]
*  Even before today, all this month, Governor Ron DeSantis has been on this kick about how many [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=116.0s)]
*  antibody treatment centers he's opened and how many doses of Regeneron, the one that doesn't work [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=120.88s)]
*  against Omicron, how many doses of Regeneron he has managed to secure for Floridians and how the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=127.2s)]
*  Biden administration hasn't been sending enough and he's demanding more. He has been doing this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=131.76s)]
*  even though it has been clear for weeks now that these treatments don't work against the Omicron [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=135.52s)]
*  variant and the Omicron variant has taken over. A week ago, the Daily Beast summed it up with this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=139.84s)]
*  accurate headline, Ron DeSantis opens antibody centers that are useless against Omicron. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=146.72s)]
*  And Governor DeSantis' Surgeon General Joseph Latapow has chimed in too, saying we should not [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=152.8s)]
*  just listen to people labeled as experts on these matters. He says he will personally continue using [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=157.28s)]
*  those antibody treatments on patients with Omicron even though they are proven not to work [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=164.64s)]
*  against Omicron. It is such a weird fight to pick right now in Florida. Under the leadership of Ron [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=169.76s)]
*  DeSantis and Joe Latapow, Florida is insisting that as a state government, they're going to do [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=177.2s)]
*  nothing to mitigate the spread of COVID whatsoever. And worse than that, they will continue to spread [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=183.27999999999997s)]
*  doubt and misinformation about both vaccines and masks. But they also insist they must be [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=188.0s)]
*  allowed to continue to give people monoclonal antibodies that literally do not work against [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=193.52s)]
*  the Omicron variant, which is COVID now. We are two years into this pandemic. This is what passes [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  for pandemic policy in our third most populous state. And as I said, Republican politics are [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  in such a state right now that what happens in Florida tends to spread to other red states as [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=216.56s)]
*  soon as it gets featured on Fox News or whatever. Dr. Latapow's confirmation process to become [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=220.56s)]
*  officially the Surgeon General of Florida, it is still not complete in Florida. He's due before [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=227.76s)]
*  the ethics committee in the state legislature there as early as next week. Perhaps at that next round [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=232.4s)]
*  of confirmation hearing, somebody will ask him about his nonsensical claims about monoclonal [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=237.76s)]
*  antibodies. Perhaps somebody will ask him about his claims of treating COVID patients when it appears [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  he had not. Maybe that will pop the bubble here. Don't hold your breath. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqw8g7JtRsw&t=249.12s)]
