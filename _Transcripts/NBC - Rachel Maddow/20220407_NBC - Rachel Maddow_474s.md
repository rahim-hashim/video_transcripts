# New Audio Evidence Further Points To Lying By Russia On Atrocities In Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI)
*  Today, Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, was pressed in an interview with Sky News [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=0.0s)]
*  about evidence that Russian soldiers killed civilians in Buche, Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=4.96s)]
*  Peskov is presented with satellite imagery, geo-located video evidence, witness testimony [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=10.48s)]
*  compiled by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, but he insists it is all fake, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  a bold fake made by Ukrainians in conjunction with private satellite imagery companies, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=20.86s)]
*  all Western media and Western governments, all to make Russia look bad. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=26.88s)]
*  As of last night, Ukrainian officials had counted 320 civilian casualties in Buche alone. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  The mayor there, saying that almost 90% of those found dead had bullet wounds, not shrapnel [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=38.28s)]
*  wounds, meaning they had been individually targeted. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=44.36s)]
*  No matter how much evidence it is presented with, the Russian government continues to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=47.56s)]
*  deny everything, to say it's all fake. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Now today, the German publication Der Spiegel has reported new evidence that will be hard [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=54.48s)]
*  for Russia to deny. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Radio traffic intercepted by Germany's Foreign Intelligence Service of Russian troops discussing [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=62.12s)]
*  the murder of civilians. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=67.88s)]
*  The radio traffic makes it seem as though the atrocities perpetuated on civilians in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=70.4s)]
*  Buche were neither random acts nor the product of individual soldiers who got out of hand. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=74.84s)]
*  Rather, the material suggests that the troops spoke of the atrocities as though they were [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=81.44s)]
*  simply discussing their everyday lives. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=86.72s)]
*  Some of the intercepted traffic apparently matches the locations of bodies found along [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=90.48s)]
*  the main road through Buche, end quote. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=94.4s)]
*  In one clip, the newspaper says, a soldier apparently told another that they had just [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=97.44s)]
*  shot a person on a bicycle. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=102.36s)]
*  In another, a man apparently said, first you interrogate soldiers, then you shoot them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=104.92s)]
*  Joining us now is Melanie Amann, who in addition to being the lead byline on this reporting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=111.76s)]
*  today is the Berlin bureau chief for Der Spiegel and a member of the paper's editorial leadership. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=116.0s)]
*  Ms. Amann, thank you for making the time to be with us tonight. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=121.96s)]
*  I want to start by asking you a bit about this intercepted audio. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=124.8s)]
*  How much audio is there? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=128.52s)]
*  How many different conversations were there and what are the kinds of things that you [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=129.84s)]
*  can hear being discussed on it? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=134.4s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=137.04s)]
*  Our sources have told us that there was a briefing of the Foreign Intelligence Service [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=139.84s)]
*  of Germany, which is abbreviated BND, and they were briefing members of parliament in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=145.48s)]
*  a classified session about the radio traffic they have intercepted from Russian troops. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=151.44s)]
*  The exact number, I can't tell you, but they apparently did read a few of these intercepts [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=158.2s)]
*  to the politicians with quite a shocking content, where the Russian soldiers were exchanging [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=163.88s)]
*  basically hints and information how they were treating the civilians in Ukraine and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=169.34s)]
*  committing murder, committing all kinds of atrocities, like saying, for example, first [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=177.18s)]
*  we interrogate them, then we shoot them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=181.94s)]
*  Now, this is of course the report that our sources gave to us. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=184.22s)]
*  We have not personally been able to listen to these intercepts, but the sources' accounts [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=187.58s)]
*  do line up. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=193.04s)]
*  It's quite shocking, actually. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=194.74s)]
*  And beyond being possible evidence of war crimes by individual soldiers, one of the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=197.14s)]
*  things that you write about is that the reason this audio is so significant is because it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=201.98s)]
*  could be used as evidence that these may not have been rogue independent actors, but rather [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  soldiers carrying out orders as part of a plan. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=211.78s)]
*  Help us understand what you have reported on that demonstrates that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=220.94s)]
*  Honestly, I think it's hard to underestimate the value of these intercepts when it comes [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=222.02s)]
*  to analyzing the military strategy of the Russian army, that indeed they were—like, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=226.46s)]
*  the atrocities committed, the killings are not just random acts of violence of people [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=232.94s)]
*  acting out or maybe acting under the stress of war or whatever, or living out their horrible [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=237.16s)]
*  fantasies, but it's actually really a coldly calculated method that has been spread through [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=243.38s)]
*  a big part of the Russian army. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  And the political relevance is also that these intercepts dismantle this narrative, the propaganda [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=253.26000000000002s)]
*  of the Russian government, of the Kremlin, that not only are the pictures fake, these [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=259.26s)]
*  people were not killed by Russian troops, and the whole propaganda is thrumbling. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  If you have people saying on record, soldiers saying on record, this is how you treat the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  civilians in this country, like shooting at a guy on a bicycle, things like this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=275.06s)]
*  And so this is what makes these intercepts so important. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=281.38s)]
*  There can be signals intelligence that's used to match to the satellite images to identify [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=288.42s)]
*  specific perpetrators, and that could be important in building a war crimes case, but there's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=293.7s)]
*  added significance because some of the audio, not all of it, has been traced to the region [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=298.3s)]
*  north of Kiev, where Butchai is located. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=303.53999999999996s)]
*  But there's also, there also seems to be audio out of other cities. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=307.38s)]
*  How do you understand that? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=311.38s)]
*  Yes, there is also apparently audio transmissions from the region of Mariupol and from other [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=313.7s)]
*  parts of the country, but especially from, like you said, the region in the north of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  Kiev, of the nation's capital, where we know that atrocities have been committed. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=325.38s)]
*  So the pieces of the puzzle add up that it's, we are confronted with actual proof that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=331.06s)]
*  the people who were there may have committed these atrocities, so they might be very valuable [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=338.34s)]
*  in the court of law. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=344.02s)]
*  I want to go back to the beginning of this. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=345.54s)]
*  You said, you're right, that the audio was intercepted by German intelligence. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=347.38s)]
*  Do you have some sense of how they intercepted it and whether they're working with other [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=351.14s)]
*  nations to do so? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=355.3s)]
*  I do, actually. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=357.78s)]
*  The interesting thing is that so far our foreign intelligence service in this very war, in this [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=359.06s)]
*  crisis, has not proved as valuable as, for example, your American services, because the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=363.7s)]
*  intelligence provided and the analysis of this intelligence by the German services has been [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=370.34s)]
*  flawed. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=375.78s)]
*  They have underestimated the war. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=376.18s)]
*  But with these intercepts, suddenly they really are ahead of the crowd, ahead of the pack, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  if you want, because, ironically, they are using a technique, they're using an infrastructure [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=383.7s)]
*  that is from the Cold War. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=390.5s)]
*  They're using these antennas 30 meters high that are located in Bavaria, which other European [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=392.34s)]
*  countries have long dismantled since the Cold War. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=400.34s)]
*  This infrastructure has been there for decades, and it's used to transmit the shortwave [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=403.86s)]
*  transmissions by the Russian army. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=409.14s)]
*  But after the Soviet times, many countries thought, well, we don't need this anymore. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  The Germans kept it since we're orderly and we stick to what we have. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=415.3s)]
*  And also, we've always poorly financed both our military and our security services. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=420.09999999999997s)]
*  I guess this is why this clunky, rusty stuff is still around. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=426.34s)]
*  And now it's proved extremely valuable because we can listen in on what the Russian troops [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=430.26s)]
*  are discussing on their shortwave transmissions. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=434.5s)]
*  That is a remarkable story. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=439.38s)]
*  Your entire reporting on this is remarkable. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  Melanie, thank you for being with us. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=443.21999999999997s)]
*  Melanie Amann is the Berlin bureau chief for Der Spiegel and the lead byline on this important [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=444.5s)]
*  piece of reporting. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=449.53999999999996s)]
*  We thank you for your time tonight. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=450.58s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=452.97999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF0mJrqRVwI&t=469.14s)]
