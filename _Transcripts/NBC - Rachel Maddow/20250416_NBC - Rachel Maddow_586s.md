# 'Criminal contempt' looms over Trump's showdown with courts over deportation fiat
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8)
*  The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders, especially [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=0.0s)]
*  by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=7.24s)]
*  To permit such officials to freely annul the judgments of the courts of the United States [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=11.6s)]
*  would not just destroy the rights acquired under those judgments, it would make a solemn [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=15.76s)]
*  mockery of the Constitution itself. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=20.68s)]
*  Defendants provide no convincing reason to avoid the conclusion that appears obvious. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=23.8s)]
*  They deliberately flouted this court's order. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=27.88s)]
*  Rather than offer a mea culpa and attempt to explain this grave error and detailed plans [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=31.04s)]
*  to rectify it, defendants offer various imaginative arguments for why they, nevertheless, technically [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=35.56s)]
*  complied with the order. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=41.8s)]
*  None of their positions withstand scrutiny. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=43.2s)]
*  Defendants' conduct, moreover, manifests a willful disregard of the court's legally [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=46.44s)]
*  binding prescriptions. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=50.68s)]
*  Given the evidence at this early stage in the inquiry and offered no persuasive reason [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=52.84s)]
*  to conclude otherwise, the court finds that there is probable cause that defendants acted [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  contemptuously. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=66.92s)]
*  When the judge says acted contemptuously, he means in a legal sense, as in the defendants [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=70.08000000000001s)]
*  acted in contempt of court. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=75.72s)]
*  If you want to know where contempt of court is on the map of the death of the republic, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=79.96s)]
*  it's that thing right on the edge of the abyss. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  You get up to the—you're approaching the cliff, there's the signs telling you you're [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=88.08s)]
*  getting close to the edge, and then you go past the signs and then you get right up to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=91.16s)]
*  the edge. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=94.24s)]
*  It's contempt of court. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=95.24s)]
*  It's right there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=96.24s)]
*  When the Trump administration started shipping people off to a foreign prison in El Salvador, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=99.24s)]
*  a judge in Washington ordered them to turn around the planes that were in the air at [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=103.36s)]
*  that moment flying to that prison. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=107.84s)]
*  The administration did not do that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=109.56s)]
*  Instead, they sent those people to that prison in El Salvador anyway. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=111.2s)]
*  Ever since, that same federal judge in Washington has been demanding answers about who exactly [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=115.08s)]
*  made the decision to defy his legally binding order and when and how and who else is implicated [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=119.56s)]
*  in this mess. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  Today, in this ruling, that Washington judge made clear that he is done playing games. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  contempt, which is on the edge of the end. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=133.72s)]
*  He gave the Trump administration until Wednesday, next week, one week, to either fix this mess [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=138.16s)]
*  by having the U.S. government retake custody of all those people it shipped to El Salvador [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=143.44s)]
*  or start handing over the names of Trump officials for the judge to hold in criminal contempt. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=149.48s)]
*  After the planes didn't turn around and landed in El Salvador, the president of that country [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=156.44s)]
*  mocked the judge's order by tweeting, quote, oopsie, too late. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=160.68s)]
*  He literally used the word oopsie. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=165.4s)]
*  That was then reposted by America's secretary of state, Marco Rubio. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=167.6s)]
*  Well, today, the judge in that case wrote that there's probable cause for contempt [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=171.52s)]
*  charges against Trump administration officials. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=175.6s)]
*  He cited that instance specifically, quote, boasts by defendants, intimated that they [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=178.44s)]
*  had defied the court's order deliberately and gleefully. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=183.68s)]
*  The secretary of state, for instance, retweeted a post in which, above a news headline noting [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=186.92s)]
*  this court's order to return the flights to the U.S., the president of El Salvador wrote, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=191.48s)]
*  oopsie, too late. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=196.4s)]
*  Life comes at you fast, Marco Rubio. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=199.04s)]
*  Joining us now is Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=201.6s)]
*  and the lead attorney in this case against the administration, Mr. Gelernt. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=205.76s)]
*  Thank you very much for being with us tonight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=209.12s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=210.32s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=211.32s)]
*  This is one of those rulings from a federal judge that gets read on nightly news shows [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=213.9s)]
*  because it is narrative and it is written in a way that is designed to make clear to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=218.14000000000001s)]
*  all people, not just lawyers, how serious the stakes are here and how badly, in this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=222.96s)]
*  judge's estimation, the administration has messed up on something very serious. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=227.66s)]
*  What's your reaction to this ruling and what do you think it will mean for this case? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=231.86s)]
*  Yeah, a few things. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=236.06s)]
*  I mean, so first of all, your introduction, I think, hit it right. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=237.82s)]
*  This is serious business and we're in a very serious place. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=242.54s)]
*  And I think you're right about the way the judge wrote it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=246.22s)]
*  I think he's writing for more than just the lawyers, more than just law professors. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=248.14s)]
*  He's trying to talk to the American public about what it would mean if court orders are [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=253.34s)]
*  violated. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=258.34s)]
*  And I think the other thing he said, which is really important, is because I've been [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=260.38s)]
*  sitting there in court, obviously, for all these hearings, is he has given the government [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=263.3s)]
*  time and time again the opportunity to explain themselves and they've simply refused. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=269.3s)]
*  The most important thing from our standpoint is I'm going to let other people get into [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=274.9s)]
*  whether we're at a constitutional crisis now or approaching it and what it means for the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=280.06s)]
*  rule of law in a larger sense. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=284.9s)]
*  The most important thing for me today was that the court said, look, they can still [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=287.38s)]
*  get out from under this if they do the right thing and bring these men back. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=292.56s)]
*  Obviously, everyone's focused on Kilmer right now and that's critically important [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=296.26s)]
*  that he be brought back. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=301.09999999999997s)]
*  But in our case, there were hundreds of Venezuelan men who were wrongfully sent to this prison [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=302.9s)]
*  and are there now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=308.34s)]
*  And I think Judge Boasberg's saying, look, as bad as this was, I don't need to go through [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=310.02s)]
*  with all this if you just do the right thing and bring these men back. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=314.26s)]
*  Unfortunately, the government has already appealed his order. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=317.9s)]
*  His order came out this afternoon. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  They've already appealed it rather than saying, OK, we'll do the right thing and bring these [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=323.18s)]
*  men back. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=327.22s)]
*  And to be clear, what the judge is signaling here is that the Trump administration does [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=328.22s)]
*  not need to set all of these people free or release them or do any other specific thing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=334.54s)]
*  The judge is simply saying that these men must be brought back into the custody of the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=342.14s)]
*  United States, that they must be under the control and custody of the United States so [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  that the proceedings on any one, any number of their cases can proceed along the lines [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=352.82s)]
*  that are afforded under the Constitution. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=358.98s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=360.5s)]
*  They're not, he's not telling the administration that they need to do any one thing with any [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=361.5s)]
*  of these men other than put them back under U.S. control. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=365.86s)]
*  Yeah, I'm glad you said that, Rachel. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=369.34s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  The judge has gone out of his way to make clear that he is not ordering these men to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  be released on U.S. streets. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=378.38s)]
*  If they've committed crimes, they could be prosecuted, they can be detained under our [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=380.26s)]
*  immigration laws, and they can be removed under our immigration laws. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=384.26s)]
*  But they can't be sent to a foreign prison potentially for the rest of their lives without [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=388.3s)]
*  due process. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=393.74s)]
*  What he is saying is bring them back to the U.S., give them due process, and if ultimately [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=394.74s)]
*  they're deported under the immigration laws, then they're deported under the immigration [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=399.62s)]
*  laws. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=403.46s)]
*  But he is not by any means saying they should be free to be out of detention until they [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=404.46s)]
*  have due process and can prove that they're not gang members. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=408.86s)]
*  But that's exactly right. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=412.34s)]
*  I mean, there's a false choice going on here, where we either send them to this brutal Salvadoran [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=413.9s)]
*  prison for the rest of their lives or we let them out on U.S. streets. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=419.82s)]
*  That's not what's going on. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=423.98s)]
*  He's simply saying you cannot use a wartime authority without any due process. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=425.62s)]
*  And he's been 100 percent clear about it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=430.42s)]
*  The government knows that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=432.46s)]
*  And what he has said to the government point blank in court is, look, if anybody in the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  administration is going out there saying, I'm letting these people out on the street, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=438.3s)]
*  they need to stop doing it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=442.38s)]
*  He's, I think, really upset that people are mischaracterizing what he's doing. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=443.86s)]
*  Do you expect—I guess the way to ask this is, do you expect a predictable outcome if [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=451.14s)]
*  does result in Trump administration officials being held in contempt? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=461.22s)]
*  I feel like that is something that is very rare in U.S. history. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=468.9s)]
*  It's certainly very rare on a matter like this, where the government has been given [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=473.18s)]
*  lots and lots and lots of opportunity to remedy its compliance with the court's orders. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=477.34000000000003s)]
*  Is there anything that we should sort of be preparing ourselves for if contempt proceedings [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=483.58s)]
*  do proceed here? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=487.42s)]
*  If the government is going to put people on the stand, it will be surprising to me, at [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=490.58000000000004s)]
*  least. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=495.98s)]
*  I think the only thing that's predictable now about the Trump administration is they're [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=496.98s)]
*  going to take this all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court again. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=500.26000000000005s)]
*  And how the court rules, I don't know. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=503.78000000000003s)]
*  But I don't see the government saying, sure, we'll bring the people back, we'll do the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=506.22s)]
*  right thing, or sure, we'll take the stand and tell you the truth. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=510.3s)]
*  I wish one of those two things would happen. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=514.5400000000001s)]
*  Right now, based on what I've seen the last few months, I don't see the Trump administration [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=517.5s)]
*  doing it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=521.2199999999999s)]
*  So I would say, in answer to your question, the only thing that's predictable is they [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=522.2199999999999s)]
*  will keep fighting. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=525.02s)]
*  They've already appealed to the circuit, and I suspect they'll go to the Supreme Court. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=526.02s)]
*  That's unfortunate that they're going to— [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=531.9s)]
*  Even if they— [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=533.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=534.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=535.3399999999999s)]
*  I mean, even if they do go to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court tells them to [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=536.3399999999999s)]
*  bring these guys back, they're going to bring these guys back. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=539.6999999999999s)]
*  They are, because they have to, because there's no other choice. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=542.06s)]
*  There's no choose-your-own-adventure in our country where an order like that from [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=544.78s)]
*  the Supreme Court is defied. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=548.8199999999999s)]
*  It just doesn't—they may hem and ha, but it's just not going to happen. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=550.06s)]
*  We're not going to be there. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=552.9s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=553.9s)]
*  Lee Larr—Deputy Director for the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, excuse me, the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=554.9s)]

*  Lee, I know it's been a long and very intense day. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=561.2199999999999s)]
*  Thanks for your help tonight. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rJsUp2v_S8&t=563.9399999999999s)]
