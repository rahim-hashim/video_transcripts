# Jan. 6 Committee hopes to protect witnesses, evidence ahead of GOP takeover of House
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA)
*  Throughout the committee's report, they note six times, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=0.0s)]
*  quote, the select committee is not revealing the identity [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=3.24s)]
*  of this witness to guard against the risk of retaliation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=5.68s)]
*  So on national security grounds and on retaliation grounds, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  they were careful about this stuff. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=12.92s)]
*  Right, they're revealing thousands of transcripts [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=14.64s)]
*  and documents, including a whole bunch [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=16.44s)]
*  that were just posted late last night. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=18.12s)]
*  But a handful of identities and pieces [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=20.44s)]
*  of specific information were held back by them [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=22.44s)]
*  because of threats, because of the risk of retaliation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=25.6s)]
*  or because of national security concerns. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=27.9s)]
*  Well, those risks increase tomorrow at noon [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=30.82s)]
*  when the committee that conducted [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=34.1s)]
*  the January 6th investigation dissolves [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=35.78s)]
*  with the current Congress. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=38.5s)]
*  The concern is that the Republicans [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=40.58s)]
*  who are taking control of the Congress, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=42.739999999999995s)]
*  they might choose to reveal the identity of witnesses [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=44.9s)]
*  like that despite the perceived threat to such witnesses. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=47.26s)]
*  That's a real concern that the committee is trying [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=50.54s)]
*  to head off right down to the wire [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=53.06s)]
*  as they head toward the hard constitutional deadline [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=55.46s)]
*  of tomorrow at noon. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=58.38s)]
*  Joining us now is California Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=59.82s)]
*  She's a member of the House's January 6th investigation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=62.46s)]
*  Congresswoman Lofgren, I know it's a busy time. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=65.42s)]
*  I appreciate you making time to be with us here tonight. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=67.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=69.5s)]
*  Happy to do it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  First, let me just ask you [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=72.64s)]
*  if I'm characterizing this the right way. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=73.66s)]
*  We noticed those letters from the committee [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=75.86s)]
*  to the White House and the Homeland Security Department [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=78.94s)]
*  effectively conveying a bunch of material [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=80.94s)]
*  to the White House and to Homeland Security [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=84.10000000000001s)]
*  for them to review, sort of taking it out [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=86.06s)]
*  of the hands of Congress. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=88.66s)]
*  It would appear to be that that's an effort [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=89.94s)]
*  to try to keep that sensitive material kept confidential. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=94.5s)]
*  The committee discussed this some time ago [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=96.94s)]
*  and it's just the volume of work that needed to get done, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  getting everything out the door. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=103.86s)]
*  So this wasn't a last minute decision at all. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=105.26s)]
*  There were just a very few witnesses, not decision makers, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=108.5s)]
*  who were assured of confidentiality for national security [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=113.78s)]
*  and potential retaliation grounds. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=120.38s)]
*  And so we have sent that to the White House for review. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=124.18s)]
*  Under the National Records Act, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=130.3s)]
*  the executive branch makes determinations [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=133.94s)]
*  about level of risk, national security matters, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=137.06s)]
*  and the like before sending them to the archives. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=140.78s)]
*  So that's that process. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=144.94s)]
*  The Homeland Security letters, a slightly different issue. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=146.54s)]
*  We ended up getting an enormous volume of information [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=152.02s)]
*  from the Selective Secret Service. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=156.3s)]
*  And they sent it to us because we were pushing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=161.78s)]
*  and we needed it right away [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=164.02s)]
*  without doing the redactions themselves [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=166.1s)]
*  for security purposes or personal identifying information. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=168.74s)]
*  And we promised not to reveal that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=173.94s)]
*  So we've sent that back. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=176.62s)]
*  Some of it, if revealed, would compromise protection [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=177.9s)]
*  of the president and vice president in the future. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=183.46s)]
*  So they've got to go through and make those determinations. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=185.9s)]
*  Classification is not something the Congress does. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=189.02s)]
*  That's something only the executive branch does. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=192.02s)]
*  And after they finished with that, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=194.82000000000002s)]
*  then they would send that over to the archives as well. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=197.3s)]
*  And then we'll see where it is. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=201.18s)]
*  I mean, if somebody wants to get information [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=202.9s)]
*  that has been designated secure, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=206.02s)]
*  there's a whole process in the act [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=209.34s)]
*  about how you sort through that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=211.78s)]
*  And that's not something I expect to be involved in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=214.06s)]
*  if Republicans in the House decide [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=217.18s)]
*  they want to get some of this information. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=220.06s)]
*  But I think it would be very irresponsible [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=222.54000000000002s)]
*  to give individual names out. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=225.14s)]
*  We know what happens on the internet. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=227.38s)]
*  People who are marginal mentally and emotionally [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=229.7s)]
*  go after innocent people. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=233.77999999999997s)]
*  And we don't want that to happen. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  Are you worried about that in a theoretical sense [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=240.7s)]
*  because they could potentially try to do that? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=242.89999999999998s)]
*  Or have there been threats [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=245.26s)]
*  from the incoming Republican majority [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=247.94s)]
*  that they do want to do that? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=249.7s)]
*  Well, there's been a discussion [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=251.77999999999997s)]
*  about investigating the investigation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=253.06s)]
*  I think if they do that, they will be sad [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=255.62s)]
*  because everything that we found is the same narrative. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=258.3s)]
*  There's no counter-narrative in the evidence that we found. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=261.94s)]
*  I mean, there it is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=265.06s)]
*  And I think it would not profit them [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=267.14s)]
*  if they're trying to defend the ex-president's lies [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=269.3s)]
*  about this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=273.22s)]
*  But there have been some extravagant claims [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  made by individual members. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=276.7s)]
*  I don't want to say that that's gonna be [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=278.5s)]
*  what the official position will be [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  of the incoming Republican majority. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=283.62s)]
*  But we did for, I think it was four individuals [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  who had sensitive positions. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=290.46000000000004s)]
*  They were witnesses, not decision makers. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=292.54s)]
*  And we did promise our best efforts for confidentiality [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  for those individuals. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB0qBuofymA&t=300.18s)]
