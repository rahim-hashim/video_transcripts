# 'Pure pointlessness and waste': Musk legacy seen in botched, illegal grab of independent group
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y)
*  So you've probably all seen the photos of President Trump's top campaign donor, Elon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Musk, in the Oval Office on Friday with a big old shiner with his black eye. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=6.16s)]
*  He claimed to have gotten that by being punched by his five-year-old son. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=10.88s)]
*  OK, maybe. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=15.08s)]
*  But with this Oval Office appearance ostensibly being his farewell after several months in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=17.48s)]
*  Washington gutting the American government, everybody sort of had the same idea at the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=22.68s)]
*  same time, right? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=26.96s)]
*  The metaphors practically wrote themselves. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=27.96s)]
*  Musk has literal black eye and figurative black eye as he leaves. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=30.76s)]
*  May I suggest an even better metaphor for what Elon Musk did in these last few months [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=35.52s)]
*  in Washington? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  Starting in March, we pretty closely covered the story of one little agency, an independent [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=42.92s)]
*  nonprofit called the U.S. Institute of Peace. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=48.24s)]
*  Elon Musk's operatives at Doge literally forced their way into the Institute of Peace in an [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=52.08s)]
*  operation that reportedly involved the FBI, the D.C. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=57.64s)]
*  Metropolitan Police, the D.C. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=61.96s)]
*  U.S. Attorney's Office and a private security firm. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=63.44s)]
*  Musk and Doge literally used armed force to get into the headquarters of this little Institute. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=67.24s)]
*  They then used that armed force to physically throw out the staff. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=73.72s)]
*  They then purported to fire all the staff, even though they legally don't have the power [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=77.36s)]
*  to do that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=81.36s)]
*  The thing that has always made the story sort of weirder and wilder than you might expect [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=82.36s)]
*  is that this U.S. Institute of Peace, it doesn't belong to the executive branch. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=86.6s)]
*  It's an independent nonprofit. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=90.36s)]
*  It was created by Congress over 40 years ago. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  It's largely funded by its own private endowment. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=94.36s)]
*  The Institute owns its own building, its headquarters. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=97.72s)]
*  They control the land the building sits on. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=100.12s)]
*  And yet Trump and his top campaign donor, Elon Musk, used force to not only take the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  building, but to also take the Institute's money, its endowment, which again was not [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=112.04s)]
*  the government's to take. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  Once Elon Musk's people had forced their way into the building and forced out the employees, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=121.0s)]
*  one Institute of Peace official told us, quote, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, now, perhaps predictably, a federal judge has ruled that all of that, from the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=142.04s)]
*  armed takeover of the building to the firing of the employees to the seizing all the Institute's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=154.44s)]
*  assets, all of that was quite flagrantly illegal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=159.48s)]
*  The judge called it a gross usurpation of power and a way of conducting government affairs [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=163.72s)]
*  that unnecessarily traumatized the committed leadership and employees of the U.S. Institute [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  of Peace, who deserved better. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=173.4s)]
*  The judge ordered the Trump administration to give everything back. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=176.28s)]
*  And so Musk and all his minions have been forced to give it all back. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  And when the reinstated actual leaders of the U.S. Institute of Peace returned to their [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=187.44s)]
*  building for the first time in over two months, just a few days ago, what they found was water [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  damage and rats and roaches, things they had never had before. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=198.72s)]
*  The acting director of the Institute of Peace told Judge Howell in a sworn statement that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=206.24s)]
*  the Trump administration essentially abandoned the building as soon as they stole it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=210.0s)]
*  And that, quote, failure to maintain and secure the building resulted, among other things, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=215.68s)]
*  in the rats and roaches and apparently whole juicy buds. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=219.78s)]
*  The Economist reports tonight that cleaners also found a whole bunch of marijuana that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=225.04s)]
*  was apparently left behind by Doge staffers after they left the place. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=230.04s)]
*  So maximum destruction, leaving everything soiled and in disrepair and littered with [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=237.56s)]
*  drugs. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  And now, because all of that was totally illegal, the folks at the U.S. Institute of Peace will [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=246.28s)]
*  have to repair everything and stand everything back up in order to even start to get back [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=251.44s)]
*  to where they were before this whole thing started. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=257.64s)]
*  It's just pure pointlessness and waste. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=260.2s)]
*  And may I suggest that, yes, the black guy was cute, but may I suggest that this is perhaps [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=264.04s)]
*  more on the nose as the legacy of what the Trump administration has done through Trump's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=268.88s)]
*  top campaign donor, Elon Musk, as Elon Musk leaves Washington. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=274.0s)]
*  A building seized, pointlessly, shut down, pointlessly, left to be infested by vermin, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=277.92s)]
*  all so its rightful owners can eventually come back and have to put it all back together [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=284.64000000000004s)]
*  again for no reason at all. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=288.8s)]
*  I think that's a better metaphor. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=293.44s)]
*  I'm just going to say it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW7t6KFN39Y&t=294.44s)]
