# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 20
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI)
*  Turns out, it was Rudy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's the front page at CNN.com right now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=3.84s)]
*  Giuliani led fake electors' plot. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Here's the Washington Post's version of that same front page story today, as Giuliani [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  coordinated plan for Trump electoral votes in states Biden won. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=16.52s)]
*  It was Mr. Giuliani, apparently. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=22.66s)]
*  You find a little thread of a story, you tug and you tug and you tug some more, and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=27.44s)]
*  then one day you're like, ugh, one more tug on the same thread, and the whole sweater [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=31.0s)]
*  comes apart. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Today was the day the whole sweater came apart. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  And now we're all sitting here in a pile of yarn going, oh, that's what it's made [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  of. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=42.44s)]
*  Here's how CNN put it in their story on this tonight. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=45.44s)]
*  Trump campaign officials led by Rudy Giuliani oversaw efforts in December 2020 to put forward [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=48.28s)]
*  illegitimate electors from states that Trump lost, according to three sources with direct [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=52.64s)]
*  knowledge of the scheme. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=57.72s)]
*  Members of former President Donald Trump's campaign team were far more involved than [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=59.4s)]
*  previously known in the plan, a core tenet of the broader plot to overturn President [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=63.24s)]
*  Biden's victory when Congress counted the electoral votes on January 6th. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=68.08s)]
*  Giuliani and his allies coordinated the nuts and bolts of the process on a state-by-state [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=72.16s)]
*  level. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=77.44s)]
*  The Trump campaign lined up supporters to fill elector slots. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=78.44s)]
*  They secured meeting rooms and state houses for the fake electors to meet on December [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=81.4s)]
*  14th, 2020. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  They circulated drafts of fake certificates that were ultimately sent to the National [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Archives. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=92.12s)]
*  Behind the scenes, Giuliani and Trump campaign officials actively choreographed the process. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  The Washington Post and their piece on this today also has this important new piece of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  news. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=104.92s)]
*  Vice President Pence's chief of staff, Mark Short, tells the Post that Rudy Giuliani and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=106.48s)]
*  his associates forwarded to Pence's office letters arguing the Trump electors should [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=111.72s)]
*  be recognized in these states that Biden had in fact won. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=119.04s)]
*  Mr. Short and Pence's legal team reviewed the unsolicited letters but were not persuaded [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  there was any legal basis to accept Trump electors who had not been certified by their [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=128.84s)]
*  states. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=134.04s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani and associates directly conveyed to Vice President Pence and his staff that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=136.76s)]
*  Pence should count the fake ones, should open the forged fake elector counts and count those [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=144.12s)]
*  instead of the real ones when it came time to tally up the Electoral College results [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=151.0s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=155.52s)]
*  Per today's reporting, Mr. Giuliani also led the effort at a nuts and bolts level to create [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=157.96s)]
*  those fake forged elector slates in the first place including distributing the drafts of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=165.72s)]
*  the fake certificates that were ultimately sent in to the Congress and the National Archives. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=172.04s)]
*  And the January 6th investigation today showed a whole bunch of its work in a kind of shocking [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=178.92s)]
*  letter to Ivanka Trump, the adult daughter of former President Trump. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=184.88s)]
*  This has been a remarkable few days for the Trump family. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=189.92s)]
*  Just in the past 48 hours, right, we've had the news reported by CNN that Eric Trump and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=194.11999999999998s)]
*  Kimberly Guilfoyle, who's the fiance of Donald Trump Jr., they reportedly both had their [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=198.6s)]
*  phone records subpoenaed and obtained by the January 6th investigation. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Also Don Jr. and Ivanka Trump, as well as their father, the former president, they were all [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  the subject of a long public-facing court filing from the New York Attorney General, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  effectively accusing them all of personal involvement in a very detailed, sort of lurid [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=218.6s)]
*  list of alleged bank fraud, tax fraud, and insurance fraud schemes at the Trump family [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  real estate business. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=229.28s)]
*  I think it must have been unsettling for those members of the Trump family that the allegations [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=231.68s)]
*  were laid out sort of in particular to each one of them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=236.0s)]
*  The filings from the New York Attorney General this week, for example, stated this about [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=240.0s)]
*  Ivanka Trump, quote, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=243.44s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=261.08s)]
*  When an attorney general says that about you specifically and personally, while asking [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=263.64s)]
*  a judge to enforce the subpoena for your testimony after your brother, the blonde one, just had [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=268.2s)]
*  to plead the fifth over 500 times in his recent deposition in that case. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=273.58s)]
*  And that's not good. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=277.96s)]
*  But now, I mean, all in the same 48-hour period, now we've got this bombshell letter to Ivanka [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=280.24s)]
*  Trump from the January 6th investigation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  And in this January 6th investigation letter to her, we do not have harsh allegations against [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=287.14s)]
*  her personally, the way we do, for example, from the New York Attorney General. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=292.91999999999996s)]
*  But we do have a surprising number of sort of eye-popping revelations about what the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=296.72s)]
*  committee has found out thus far, what the committee knows. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=302.68s)]
*  And there are lots of questions for Ms. Trump to come in and talk about what she knows, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=306.62s)]
*  given how much she apparently features in other people's testimony. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  There's so much going on in this today. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  We're going to get expert help understanding the importance of some of these revelations [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  in just a moment. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  But let me just give you a couple of them to start. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  This is from the letter. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=324.04s)]
*  As January 6th approached, President Trump attempted on multiple occasions to persuade [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=325.64s)]
*  Vice President Pence to participate in his plan to not count the legitimate electors [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=330.09999999999997s)]
*  for the Electoral College vote. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  One of the president's discussions with Vice President Pence occurred on the phone on the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=337.44s)]
*  morning of January 6th. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=340.56s)]
*  You, meaning you, Ivanka Trump, you were present in the Oval Office and observed at least one [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=342.28s)]
*  side of that telephone conversation. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=347.28s)]
*  General Keith Kellogg was also present in the Oval Office during that call. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=349.47999999999996s)]
*  And he has testified to the January 6th investigation about that discussion as follows. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=352.92s)]
*  Question. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  Then there's this transcript from Keith Kellogg's testimony. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  Question. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=362.36s)]
*  It's been reported that the president said to the vice president, you don't have the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=363.36s)]
*  courage to make a hard decision. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=366.40000000000003s)]
*  And maybe not those exact words, but something like that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=368.16s)]
*  Do you remember anything like that? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  Answer from Keith Kellogg. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=372.12s)]
*  Words. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=373.48s)]
*  And I don't remember exactly either, but something like that, yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=374.52000000000004s)]
*  Being like, you're not tough enough to make the call. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=377.48s)]
*  Question. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=380.12s)]
*  Another report of this phone call is that Trump said, Mike, it's not right. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=381.12s)]
*  You can do this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=384.04s)]
*  I'm counting on you to do it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=385.04s)]
*  If you don't do it, I picked the wrong man four years ago. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=386.04s)]
*  You're going to wimp out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  Do you remember anything like that? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=390.64s)]
*  Answer from Keith Kellogg. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=392.62s)]
*  Words like that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=394.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=395.52s)]
*  I can't exactly. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=396.52s)]
*  I can't. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=397.52s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=398.52s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=399.52s)]
*  General Kellogg also testified regarding your remarks, meaning Ivanka Trump's remarks, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=401.08s)]
*  at the close of the call. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=405.94s)]
*  The letter then continues. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=407.24s)]
*  The Select Committee wishes to discuss the part of the conversation you observed between [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=415.8s)]
*  President Trump and Vice President Pence on the morning of January 6th. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=419.32s)]
*  Similarly, the committee would like to discuss any other conversations you may have witnessed [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=422.92s)]
*  or participated in regarding the president's plan to obstruct or impede the counting of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=426.36s)]
*  electoral votes. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=431.6s)]
*  The committee has information suggesting that President Trump's White House counsel may [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=433.16s)]
*  have concluded that the actions President Trump directed Vice President Pence to take [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  would violate the Constitution or would otherwise be illegal. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=442.0s)]
*  Did you discuss those issues with any member of the White House counsel's office? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=445.96000000000004s)]
*  To your knowledge, were any such legal conclusions shared with President Trump? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=449.36s)]
*  Similarly, I mean, sorry. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=453.76000000000005s)]
*  Similarly, in the days before January 6th, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, which [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=458.76s)]
*  is the furthest right, most pro-Trump caucus within the House Republican, within among [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=463.48s)]
*  Republican members of the House of Representatives. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=468.68s)]
*  In the days before January 6th, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, with knowledge of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=472.62s)]
*  the president's planning for that day, sent a message to the White House chief of staff [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=476.44s)]
*  with this explicit warning, quote, If POTUS allows this to occur, we're driving a stake [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=480.03999999999996s)]
*  in the heart of the federal republic. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=486.56s)]
*  Did you discuss that or similar concerns with the White House chief of staff or with the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=489.24s)]
*  vice president or his staff? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=493.12s)]
*  The committee, after all of that, goes on to assert that Trump actually did intend, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=496.76s)]
*  he did want to go down to the Capitol himself after he made his speech riling up the crowd. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=502.16s)]
*  He apparently wanted to lead the mob down to the US Capitol personally. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=509.32s)]
*  They said they want to ask Ivanka about that. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=513.8399999999999s)]
*  The committee also asserts that they have found no evidence that Trump ever called for [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=517.16s)]
*  the National Guard to be deployed or for any other law enforcement effort being made to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=520.4799999999999s)]
*  protect the Capitol over the entire scope of the day on January 6th. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=524.1999999999999s)]
*  It just goes on and on. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=529.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's all revelations about what the committee has found. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=530.64s)]
*  I should also point out that it then ends pointedly with a reminder to Ms. Trump that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=535.5999999999999s)]
*  all White House officials need to have their communications preserved and handed over to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=540.96s)]
*  the National Archives, with the clear implication that perhaps her communications have not been [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=545.2s)]
*  adequately archived and she needs to do that. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=550.4s)]
*  Joining us now is Daniel Goldman. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=556.24s)]
*  He's a former assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=557.6s)]
*  He also served as the Democrats Majority Council during Donald Trump's first impeachment trial. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=560.1600000000001s)]
*  Mr. Goldman, thank you for being here. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=565.6s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=567.12s)]
*  I was really hoping we could get to talk to you tonight. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=570.56s)]
*  Amazing Newsday on the legal front. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=572.16s)]
*  It really is. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=574.64s)]
*  So let me ask you first about the Ivanka Trump letter today and what the January 6th [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=577.1999999999999s)]
*  investigators told us in that letter about their investigation. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  I just wanted to ask you, there was a lot of revelation. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=586.88s)]
*  There were a lot of revelations in that letter to me today in terms of stuff that [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=589.3599999999999s)]
*  I didn't know they knew. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=592.88s)]
*  Quotes from transcripts, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=595.76s)]
*  descriptions of things that we had never had described to us before. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=598.1600000000001s)]
*  What stood out to you as the most significant thing about that? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=601.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, I think some of what stands out to me really is the types of evidence that they have. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=605.76s)]
*  The fact that Keith Kellogg, who I remember refused to testify in the first impeachment [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=613.44s)]
*  investigation that I was running, he came in and testified and he gave a sort of [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=620.96s)]
*  minute by minute, clearly gave from the document, a minute by minute exposition of what happened [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=626.72s)]
*  that he saw on January 6th, including conversations that Donald Trump was having. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=633.9200000000001s)]
*  We now know that Kayleigh McEnany, who testified last week, the former press secretary, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=639.9200000000001s)]
*  provided text messages to the committee. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=646.1600000000001s)]
*  So we're starting to see that the committee is actually getting a lot of evidence, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=649.76s)]
*  notwithstanding some of the obfuscation and obstruction from the Meadows and the Bannons, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=655.92s)]
*  et cetera, that they're still gathering and able to gather a lot of evidence. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=661.28s)]
*  And it was interesting to me, Rachel, it's an 11 page letter. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=667.5999999999999s)]
*  And obviously the committee did not need to include all of this evidence for a request to [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=671.28s)]
*  Ivanka Trump. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=677.28s)]
*  But I noted a couple of things that I thought were really interesting legally. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=678.56s)]
*  First, they're really narrowing their request to January 6th. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=682.48s)]
*  And in light of that Supreme Court decision that you referenced yesterday, which relies on the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=686.48s)]
*  Court of Appeals decision earlier, where basically courts have said that it doesn't matter whether [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=691.44s)]
*  Donald Trump is the former president or would be president now, but matters that occurred on [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=697.0400000000001s)]
*  January 6th are not subject to executive privilege. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=702.96s)]
*  That's basically everything that they ask Ivanka Trump for. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=706.1600000000001s)]
*  And then the other thing that jumps out to me is they're putting Ivanka Trump in a really [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  difficult position by laying out all of this evidence. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=715.76s)]
*  Now we know what evidence they have and we know how relevant and important her testimony is. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=718.96s)]
*  So if she is going to refuse to testify based on some fictional reason, she looks a lot worse [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=725.6s)]
*  because it's very clear that she's an important witness. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=733.76s)]
*  So strategically, I thought it was a very interesting and smart move by the committee. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=736.8s)]
*  So this is the letter today from the district attorney of Fulton County, Georgia to the county's [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=743.92s)]
*  chief judge. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=749.12s)]
*  Quote, Dear Chief Judge Brasher, I hope this letter finds you well and in good spirits. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=750.0799999999999s)]
*  Excellent start. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=755.28s)]
*  Quote, Please be advised that the district attorney's office has received information [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=756.64s)]
*  indicating a reasonable probability that the state of Georgia's administration of elections [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=760.0s)]
*  in 2020, including the state's election of the president of the United States, was subject [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=765.36s)]
*  to possible criminal disruptions. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=769.84s)]
*  Therefore, I am hereby requesting as the elected district attorney for Fulton County [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=773.04s)]
*  that a special purpose grand jury be impaneled for the purpose of investigating the facts [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=777.2s)]
*  and circumstances relating directly or indirectly to possible attempts to disrupt the lawful [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=781.2s)]
*  administration of the 2020 elections in the state of Georgia. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=786.48s)]
*  But then there's also the sort of just almost surreal point. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=790.88s)]
*  It's a true assertion. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=796.0799999999999s)]
*  It's just bizarre. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  And she puts this right up front in her letter to the county judge today as to why her office [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=799.68s)]
*  needs this special grand jury, which is that conceivably there are lots of law enforcement [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=803.68s)]
*  agencies in Georgia who could take up this matter if in fact there's reasonable suspicion [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=810.8s)]
*  that Georgia's statewide elections were criminally interfered with. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=816.0799999999999s)]
*  Why does it have to be the Fulton County District Attorney who pursues the evidence and tries [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=821.12s)]
*  to put together the prosecution? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=825.4399999999999s)]
*  Why that one county prosecutor's office? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=827.04s)]
*  Well, she makes a very good case. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=830.16s)]
*  It's because every other law enforcement agency that could conceivably be investigating this [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=832.9599999999999s)]
*  was a potential witness to the alleged crime. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=838.0799999999999s)]
*  The Georgia Secretary of State's office. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=841.92s)]
*  That was one of the targets of the alleged perpetrators of this scheme. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=843.68s)]
*  The Georgia Attorney General's office. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=846.7199999999999s)]
*  Also one of the targets of the alleged perpetrators of this scheme. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=848.8s)]
*  The U.S. Attorney's office, the federal prosecutor's office in Georgia. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=852.2399999999999s)]
*  That was one of the targets of the alleged perpetrators of this scheme. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=855.8399999999999s)]
*  So, you know, if your office is inside the crime scene tape, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  that makes it hard for your office to be the entity investigating the crime scene. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=865.5999999999999s)]
*  Therefore, quote, this office, meaning the Fulton County DA's office, is the sole agency with [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=869.68s)]
*  jurisdiction that's not a potential witness to conduct related to this matter. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=874.56s)]
*  As a result, our office has opened an investigation into any coordinated attempts to unlawfully [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=878.88s)]
*  alter the outcome of the 2020 elections in this state. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=883.84s)]
*  Just a on top of everything else, just a remarkable development today in the great state of Georgia. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is Gwen Keese-Fleming. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=894.3199999999999s)]
*  Ms. Keese-Fleming is the former district attorney in Dekalb County, which is right next to Fulton [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=896.8000000000001s)]
*  County. She has known Fulton County District Attorney Fonny Willis for years. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=899.6800000000001s)]
*  Ms. Keese-Fleming, you have helped us understand so much about this case up until now. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=903.44s)]
*  I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight now that this big step has happened. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=907.28s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=912.64s)]
*  So the last time you were here, we talked about the prospect that DA Willis [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=914.32s)]
*  might move to impanel a special grand jury. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=918.88s)]
*  What does it say to you? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=921.84s)]
*  What's important to you? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=923.28s)]
*  What does it say to you? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=924.88s)]
*  What's important for us to understand now that she's done it and now that we're able to see [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=926.0799999999999s)]
*  the reasoning for doing it that she's laid out in this letter? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it's a smart move and a strategic move. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=934.7199999999999s)]
*  She has indicated previously that she would be methodically working through [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=938.4s)]
*  all of the evidence in this case and use all of the resources available to her to do just that. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=943.04s)]
*  And a special grand jury is one of those tools and resources that allows her to subpoena witnesses. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=949.52s)]
*  She notes in the letter that she has run into the challenge of some witnesses not coming [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=956.8s)]
*  forth and talking to her office voluntarily. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=961.84s)]
*  This signals to me that she did not prematurely ask for a special grand jury. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=965.04s)]
*  She has done, she and her team have done significant investigation up until this point [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=969.76s)]
*  and are only at making this request at the point that she needs the help from the court. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=975.6s)]
*  The special grand jury also, as she notes, will not be constrained by a two month time [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=981.44s)]
*  that a regular criminal grand jury has, which also means that this dedicated group of Fulton [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=986.72s)]
*  County residents will be able to focus on this one case and this one case only for as long as it [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=993.36s)]
*  takes to get to or complete the investigation. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=999.6s)]
*  In my experience when I was DA, we had special grand juries that were in panel for as long as a [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1003.12s)]
*  year. That's not to say it will take that long in this matter, but again, it removes one of the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1007.92s)]
*  obstacles in terms of having to make a decision in a certain timeframe, particularly when you're [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1014.24s)]
*  investigating a case as complex as this one and you don't know where all of the evidence is going [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1021.6s)]
*  to lead you. The early witnesses that are subpoenaed may lead to more subpoenas, more questions, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1026.64s)]
*  the need for more documents. And so this is the beginning for her of a very long investigation. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1032.32s)]
*  How rare are special grand juries in Georgia? I'm thinking about the chief county judge who [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1041.6s)]
*  received this request today and what I learned today about how this will be decided, which is that [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1047.6799999999998s)]
*  a majority of the judges in the county need to say yes in order for this request to be granted. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1053.9199999999998s)]
*  How frequently is something like this pursued? Not frequently. And again, it's usually reserved [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1061.44s)]
*  for cases that are either they span crimes in a long span of time, years in some instances, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1068.24s)]
*  or they're very complex. And if you recall some of the earlier statements DA Willis has made, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1076.72s)]
*  she was looking at four different elements here. She was looking at the January 2nd call. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1082.96s)]
*  She was looking at the January 4th resignation of the US attorney. She was looking at an earlier [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1089.84s)]
*  November call between one of the senators and the secretary of state's office. And she was also [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1096.08s)]
*  looking at statements that were made to the Georgia legislature. So she this demonstrates [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1102.32s)]
*  the complexity and why a special grand jury would be warranted in this case. I think it's also [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1108.0s)]
*  important to point out with the judge's vote, because she is seeking this grand jury in light [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1113.76s)]
*  of reticence of some people coming forward to talk with her office to continue the investigation, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1120.64s)]
*  I think it's critical that she mentioned that because it's very unlikely that judges will [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1128.96s)]
*  reward that opposition by denying her request. Again, if they say no, then all of the evidence [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1132.96s)]
*  that she needs will never come to light. And so again, judges taking oath just like prosecutors, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1140.08s)]
*  it's their duty to uphold the law. And again, this grand jury is the best opportunity to fully vet [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1145.84s)]
*  all of the evidence that's available. And they can make recommendations as to what charges, if any, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1152.56s)]
*  should be brought. Is it notable that DA Willis has requested that an individual county judge be [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1158.48s)]
*  appointed to oversee the special grand jury and supervise their work? Or is that just how these [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1167.04s)]
*  things are handled? That's how these things are handled. That's a part of the statute. And it [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1171.36s)]
*  helps her in the event that there is any sort of dispute with the particular witness, particularly [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1176.1599999999999s)]
*  if that witness hires counsel and they want to contest the subpoena. It allows to have one judge [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1181.44s)]
*  that would resolve all of those issues over the course of the impanelment of the special grand [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1187.28s)]
*  jury rather than it going to different judges on different things. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBOsDtcmNI&t=1192.88s)]
