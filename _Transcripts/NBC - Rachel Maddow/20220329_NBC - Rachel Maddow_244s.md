Video Description: Inna Sovsun, member of the Ukrainian parliament, points out that Vladimir Putin is legitimately popular with many Russians, as is his style, so there is a strong chance that even if he were to be removed from power, his replacement would be a similar type of leader anyway.

# Russians Don't Necessarily Share West's View Of Putin's Belligerence
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg)
*  I want to turn now to Ina Sovson. She's a member of the Ukrainian Parliament. She's joining us live [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=0.0s)]
*  from Kyiv. Ms. Sovson, good to see you again. Thank you for being with us. I do want to ask you, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  because there's some clarification and confusion going on about what President Biden said in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=11.44s)]
*  Warsaw on Saturday. He said again today that what he said he meant, the idea that Vladimir Putin [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=17.6s)]
*  has to go. That doesn't necessarily mean there's an American plan or a Western or a NATO alliance [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=25.84s)]
*  plan to take Vladimir Putin out, but he was expressing a view that this is not necessarily [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Russia's war. This is not the war of the Russian people. I don't think most of the Russian people [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=37.36s)]
*  care about this thing. This is Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine. Well, I would agree with President [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=41.6s)]
*  Biden in his moral judgment saying that this person cannot stay in power, this person cannot [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=50.32s)]
*  run Russia. And he didn't make many clarifications on that, saying that this is his moral judgment, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  not a policy proposal. And I would agree with that. I do disagree, however, with this statement that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=61.92s)]
*  Russians do not care or that common Russians are not in support of the war, because unfortunately, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=68.4s)]
*  the situation is much more terrifying because 80% of Russians actually support this war against [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=75.44s)]
*  Ukraine. And we are hearing more and more evidence of people in Russia actually truly being in favor [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=81.44s)]
*  of that. Well, of course, they have been victims to propaganda machine set up by Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=87.28s)]
*  But regardless of the reason and the method of how that happened, the absolute majority of Russians [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=93.44s)]
*  actually support killings of Ukrainians. And I've read so many statements by the Russians online, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=99.76s)]
*  to an extent that they are allowed to use Internet, of course. They all give some very crazy ideas and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=106.88000000000001s)]
*  explanations why they want the war in Ukraine. I think the most logical, if you can call it this, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=112.72s)]
*  that I have read was this woman saying that, well, if we didn't attack them, they would have attacked [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  us. And that is, trust me, the most logical thing that I have heard, because the other things they [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=124.56s)]
*  were saying, saying like they were creating that biological weapon. And when asked, what do you mean [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=129.04s)]
*  by biological weapon? They were saying like they're creating the special birds that will only attack [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=134.16s)]
*  someone who is ethnically Russian. And they were planning to send those birds into Russia and to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=139.44s)]
*  kill all of us. And that is as crazy as it gets. And I'm sorry to say this, but this is basically [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  the whole nation or the majority of the nation gone wild. It's not just Vladimir Putin, no matter [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=149.92s)]
*  how much we wish for that to be true. So is that an issue of not concentrating on Vladimir Putin [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=154.72s)]
*  being out of office? If that's not the only problem? I ask you this because the Russians responded to [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  President Biden's statement by saying it's not for Joe Biden to decide who the president of Russia is. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  It's for the Russian people. But it's very obvious that the Russian people don't actually have a say [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=175.2s)]
*  in whether Vladimir Putin is their president. They don't live in a democracy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=179.36s)]
*  Well, it's actually a hypocritical of the Russian to remind the world that it's for Russian people [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  to say who will be the ruler of Russia. Well, they attacked Ukraine saying that they don't want [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky to be the president of Ukraine, even though, of course, our elections are so much [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  more free than the Russian ones. But I do think that, of course, the problem is not just with [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Putin because he truly has the absolute majority of support in Russia. And I do think [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=207.36s)]
*  that the process of demilitarization, denazification of Russia will be much, much slower. It's not just [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=213.44000000000003s)]
*  a matter of changing Putin, even if we can imagine that to happen if he somehow disappears from the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  Russian political scene. It's also a matter of the whole population just supporting his ideas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=225.52s)]
*  And if Putin is gone, if he dies, he's killed or whatever happens to him, they will vote for someone [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=230.72000000000003s)]
*  with very similar ideas, because those are the ideas that they all share right now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=237.28s)]
*  And that is scary. That is truly scary. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pfb3a9cWgg&t=241.44s)]
