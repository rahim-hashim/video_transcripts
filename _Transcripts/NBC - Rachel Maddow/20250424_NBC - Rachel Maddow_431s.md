# Trump facing impotence as courts hand him loss after loss; court of public opinion no less harsh
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI)
*  Things are going very, very dramatically south for Trump with the American public, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=0.0s)]
*  in truly overwhelming numbers and over the widest possible breadth of issues. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=5.92s)]
*  And, you know, correlation is not causation, but that is happening at the same time [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=10.16s)]
*  that things are going south for Trump in terms of him just being stopped when he's trying to do stuff. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=16.8s)]
*  Americans of various stripes and in various positions associated with various institutions [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=22.8s)]
*  just stopping him from doing what he's trying to get away with. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=27.2s)]
*  This week, for example, Trump has been blocked by two more judges, one in Colorado, one in New York, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=30.0s)]
*  both prohibiting him from using the Alien Enemies Act from the freaking 1700s to try to disappear [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=35.04s)]
*  any more people without giving them the opportunity to contest what he's calling them and what he's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=42.24s)]
*  doing to them. In New York, a federal district court judge extended his earlier order blocking [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  issue. He said in his ruling this week, quote, this is not the Inquisition. It is not Medieval [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=53.04s)]
*  Times. This is the United States of America. Yes. Speaking of the black death. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=58.8s)]
*  Now, yet another federal judge has ordered Trump to return to the United States, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=66.48s)]
*  yet another man who Trump sent to that prison in El Salvador. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=70.72s)]
*  Everybody in the country has now been following closely this case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=75.36s)]
*  The administration is still trying to dodge and delay its response to the Supreme Court's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=79.12s)]
*  directive that Mr. Abrego Garcia needs to be returned to the United States. But now there's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=83.92s)]
*  another man. Now a Maryland federal judge has ordered that Trump must return yet another young [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  man who he sent to El Salvador, a man identified only by the name Christian in court proceedings. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=93.76s)]
*  Simultaneously, Frederica Wilson is the latest Democratic member of Congress to show up [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=101.84s)]
*  bodily at one of these black hole sites where Trump has been shipping people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=108.4s)]
*  We spoke earlier this week on this program with Congressman Troy Carter, who led a delegation [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=113.28s)]
*  of U.S. members of Congress and one senator down to the two Trump administration immigration prisons [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=117.76s)]
*  in Louisiana. Now, Frederica Wilson, the Democratic congressman from Florida, has gone to another one [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=123.2s)]
*  of these facilities, the one in South Florida. That's the so-called Chrome immigration prison [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=128.32s)]
*  in Miami. And it's important that she is there. Part of not disappearing people is making sure [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=133.68s)]
*  that the places people are taken to stay on the map and get high profile visitors and oversight [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=141.36s)]
*  and press attention. And Democratic members of Congress, including Frederica Wilson today, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=147.36s)]
*  are starting now to make that happen. Trump lost in court again this week on his transgender [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  military ban. He's now asking the United States Supreme Court to take it up. Trump lost in court [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  this week on denying passports to transgender people as well. Trump lost in court this week on [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=163.12s)]
*  trying to shut down the Voice of America media service. Trump lost in court this week on his [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=168.16s)]
*  bizarre executive order trying to mount a federal takeover of elections. This is, you might remember [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=173.04s)]
*  this, this is where he said he wanted to hand over all state voter rolls to his top campaign [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=179.28s)]
*  donor, Elon Musk. Because yeah, what could possibly go wrong with that? That was blocked today in court. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=184.88s)]
*  Trump lost today in court as well on denying so-called sanctuary cities and counties federal [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=192.64s)]
*  funds. Trump lost in court today on trying to impose ideological anti-diversity punishments [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=198.32s)]
*  on American school districts. And to add insult to injury, Trump also today got to enjoy the spectacle [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=205.04s)]
*  of the Republican governor of North Dakota vetoing a North Dakota, excuse me, vetoing a Trump-inspired [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=213.44s)]
*  North Dakota book ban that would have sentenced librarians in North Dakota to prison terms [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=220.96s)]
*  for violating that ban. He vetoed it. Republicans in the state legislature passed it, but he vetoed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  it. That's too far even for the Republican governor of North Dakota, who can probably read a poll. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=234.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's how it's going over with the Republican governor of North Dakota. How do you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=242.56s)]
*  think it's going over with the American public that they're trying to pull this book ban stuff [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=246.0s)]
*  at places like the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=249.84s)]
*  This was St. Augustine, Florida yesterday. People protesting against Trump's cuts to the national [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=257.52s)]
*  parks. Protect our national parks. We love our national park rangers. Protect our public lands. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=264.64s)]
*  This was Modesto, California, on the left side of your screen at the offices of Republican [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=272.48s)]
*  Congressman Tom McClintock. On the right side of your screen, that's Pueblo, Colorado, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=277.04s)]
*  at the offices of Republican Congressman Jeff Hurd. In both cases yesterday, people protesting [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  against Trump and the Republicans planned huge cuts to Medicaid. This was Des Moines, Iowa. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=286.56s)]
*  Iowans rally for the rights of the deported. People rallying in Des Moines on the left side [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=294.64000000000004s)]
*  of your screen and on the right side of your screen, people rallying at the federal building [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  in Rochester, New York, in both cases telling Trump to obey court orders, to stop disappearing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=303.52s)]
*  people without due process. This was the courthouse in Charlottesville, Virginia. On the left side of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  your screen, people turned up there, furious yesterday, to protest after Trump's agents [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=316.0s)]
*  arrested immigrants inside the courthouse yesterday. And on the right side of your screen, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  that's Burlington, Vermont, where people again protested at the federal building in support of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=326.0s)]
*  Vermont resident Mohsen Madhawi, who was arrested, you will remember, at his U.S. citizenship test. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=330.24s)]
*  How's Trump doing turning around public opinion about his behavior in office? Well, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=338.16s)]
*  he's cutting meals on wheels for the elderly and disabled, dismantling the agency that does that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=342.72s)]
*  Trump is trying to have millions of people who are alive legally classified as dead [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=350.72s)]
*  in the Social Security Administration without any due process and without any process in place for [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=357.91999999999996s)]
*  these people to correct it if and when they can show up at a Social Security office to try to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=362.88s)]
*  prove that they are alive. Trump is apparently keeping in place his defense secretary, Pete [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=368.4s)]
*  Hegseth, who the AP is reporting tonight, installed an insecure internet connection in his office, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=374.32s)]
*  a public-facing insecure internet connection in his office that bypassed Pentagon security protocols. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=380.4s)]
*  Apparently, specifically so he could use a commercial messaging app for texting, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=387.28s)]
*  because maybe he didn't understand why his cell phone wasn't working inside the Pentagon [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=391.84s)]
*  for his texting habits. Oh, weird. How come your cell phone isn't working good in there? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  Better rig something up to bypass security. He's turning out to be a real peach on national [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=402.55999999999995s)]
*  security. Trump is apparently keeping him in place. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5WpL760XNI&t=407.67999999999995s)]
