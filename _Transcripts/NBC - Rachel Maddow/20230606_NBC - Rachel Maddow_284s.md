Video Description: Rachel Maddow looks at Donald Trump's inability to absorb the lesson that it's a bad idea for American leaders to offer congratulations to dictators and points out that even on such an obvious mistake Ron DeSantis could muster only tepid criticism of Trump.

# 'Do not congratulate': Trump coziness with dictators tests GOP primary opponents
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY)
*  The Deja news moment that I have been having today is one from 2018 from the Trump administration. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=0.0s)]
*  Do you remember the do not congratulate saga? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=9.0s)]
*  Do you remember this? This was five years ago, 2018, the Washington Post broke this bizarre story about then President Trump getting briefed by his national security advisor. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=14.0s)]
*  He was about to get on a phone call with Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=26.0s)]
*  By then, it was pretty well established that Trump didn't like getting too much in print in terms of briefing materials. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=30.0s)]
*  So the Washington Post reported March 2018 that Trump's advisors made sure that they put one thing in his briefing letter in his briefing papers in all capital letters. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=36.0s)]
*  Basically, the idea being, OK, we know you don't like to read. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=48.0s)]
*  But if you if you only take away one thing, if you only remember one thing we're telling you should get on this call, just remember this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=51.0s)]
*  We're going to put it in all capital letters on a piece of paper on your desk in front of you while you're talking to him. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=58.0s)]
*  And what we're going to tell you to do, you can't forget this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=64.0s)]
*  Do not congratulate. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=68.0s)]
*  That was in all capital letters right in front of him while they put him on the phone with Putin. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=71.0s)]
*  Now, the reason they did that is because Russia had just had some elections ostensibly. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=77.0s)]
*  They were not real elections. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=82.0s)]
*  It was therefore important that the president of the United States shouldn't endorse the purported outcome of these elections as if they were real. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=84.0s)]
*  So there's this three word note in his briefing materials. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=92.0s)]
*  Whatever else you say to this guy, do not congratulate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=96.0s)]
*  And then what happened? Trump, of course, got on the phone with Putin and immediately said, I want to congratulate you, sir. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=99.0s)]
*  On your great election victory. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=106.0s)]
*  It's the one thing he was supposed to not say. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=108.0s)]
*  Do not congratulate. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=111.0s)]
*  It's the first thing he said to the guy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=113.0s)]
*  That was 2018. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=117.0s)]
*  Deja news, because this was this weekend. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=119.0s)]
*  Congratulations, Kim Jong Un, or as he spelled it, Kim Jong Un. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=124.0s)]
*  I mean, lots of foreign leaders names are hard to spell. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=130.0s)]
*  Kim Jong Un is not one of those names. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=135.0s)]
*  I just got to say it's still it's pretty much phonetic. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=138.0s)]
*  It's Kim Jong Un. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=142.0s)]
*  How hard is that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=144.0s)]
*  But still, he misspelled it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=145.0s)]
*  More to the point, though, in general, American politicians in no circumstances should be congratulating the dictator of North Korea on anything. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=148.0s)]
*  I mean, barring Kim Jong Un like stepping down and apologizing, that might be the only thing you'd congratulate him for. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=157.0s)]
*  Otherwise, do not congratulate standing order when it comes to the dictator of North Korea. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=164.0s)]
*  But there's Trump warmly congratulating Kim Jong Un and misspelling it in the meantime. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=169.0s)]
*  And, you know, in any normal political world, somewhere between you deciding to congratulate the North Korean dictator and you misspelling that congratulations, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=178.0s)]
*  somewhere between there, the idea of you as presidential material would like shred itself and blow away like a plastic bag on the median of a 10 lane highway. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=190.0s)]
*  But instead, you know, he's still the front runner of the Republican Party's presidential nominating contest for 2024. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=199.0s)]
*  Do not congratulate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=208.0s)]
*  And all the other candidates in that race, and there are many of them now, they're all sort of struggling with what to do. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=211.0s)]
*  Do even with something that bad was something that obviously wrong, even with this guy issuing warm congratulations to the North Korean dictator. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=219.0s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, for example, he was asked about this and he managed to say that he was, quote, surprised. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=230.0s)]
*  To see that congratulations from former President Trump for the dictator of North Korea. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=239.0s)]
*  He said he was surprised. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=243.0s)]
*  Surprised really. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=246.0s)]
*  I mean, Trump expressing warm misspelled congratulations to the North Korean dictator is a lot of things. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=247.0s)]
*  But is it surprising? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=255.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=257.0s)]
*  You really didn't see that coming? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=258.0s)]
*  Really didn't see this exact thing from him before? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=259.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pY-M3z4XkY&t=273.0s)]
