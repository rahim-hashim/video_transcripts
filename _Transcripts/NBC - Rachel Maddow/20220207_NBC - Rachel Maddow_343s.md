# Trump Flouting Of Presidential Records Act Leaves National Archives Scrambling
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk)
*  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the end of Trump's address sitting right behind him and ripping up her copy of the speech in two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=0.0s)]
*  Immediately afterwards reporters caught up with her as she left the House chamber [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  Madam Speaker, what did you think of Trump's speech tonight? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  It was the dirtiest thing to do [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=21.54s)]
*  Zing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=25.38s)]
*  Now as you may remember the Republican Party then immediately fell into this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=26.74s)]
*  Hysterical pearl clutching over standards of decency and decorum, which was pretty rich [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=30.939999999999998s)]
*  Given the standards of decency and decorum generally observed by the sitting Republican president [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=37.34s)]
*  But when Donald Trump himself was asked about it a couple days later, he took it even further [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=43.379999999999995s)]
*  Well, I thought it was a terrible thing when she ripped up the speech first of all, it's an official document [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=50.86s)]
*  You're not allowed. It's illegal what she did. She broke the law. It's illegal. She broke the law [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=55.86s)]
*  That happened two years ago today and friends those comments have not aged well [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=62.62s)]
*  Now first of all in case this needs clarifying Nancy Pelosi did not break the law [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=69.14s)]
*  But there is someone with a well-known history of actually destroying official presidential records [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=75.02s)]
*  Politico was the first to report back in 2018 that President Trump had a habit of ripping up documents and that federal government record [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=80.72s)]
*  specialists found themselves [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=88.12s)]
*  Rescuing Trump's hand-shredded papers and trying to scotch tape them back together [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=90.12s)]
*  Even some that were torn into confetti sized pieces [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=95.72s)]
*  Because there is a law the presidential records act requiring that as you know [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=99.6s)]
*  Presidential records be properly preserved and stored by the National Archives [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  Sure enough when the January 6th investigation started receiving Trump White House records that Trump had fought for months to block them from getting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=111.76s)]
*  Some of them had indeed been ripped up and taped back together and this week [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=120.28s)]
*  The Washington Post reported that quote Trump's shredding of paper was far more widespread and indiscriminate than previously known [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  Throughout his presidency staffers made a habit of coming in behind Trump to retrieve the piles of torn paper [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=135.16s)]
*  Left in his wake and then quote jigsawing the documents back together with tape [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=143.32s)]
*  And it went beyond just tearing things up quote one senior Trump White House official said he and other White House staffers frequently put [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=149.18s)]
*  documents into burn bags to be destroyed rather than preserving them and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=156.88s)]
*  Would decide themselves what should be saved and what should be burned [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=163.0s)]
*  When the January 6th committee asked for certain documents related to Trump's efforts to pressure vice president Mike Pence for example [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Some of them no longer existed in this person's files because they had already been shredded end quote a [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  Former senior Trump official said of Trump quote he didn't want a record of anything [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=183.6s)]
*  Now I guess one simple straightforward way to describe that might be this [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=188.08s)]
*  It's an official document you're not allowed it's illegal what she did she broke the law [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=194.8s)]
*  Donald Trump apparently also took a whole bunch of president presidential records [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=200.6s)]
*  With him when he left the White House and just stuck him at his golf club in Florida [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=204.96s)]
*  The Washington Post reports today that the National Archives had to go retrieve [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=210.24s)]
*  15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago that should have been turned over when Trump left the White House and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=215.56s)]
*  The National Archives says that Trump's staff are quote continuing to search [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=221.8s)]
*  End quotes for additional records that may have been thrown into Trump's u-haul when he left the White House for Mar-a-Lago [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=227.0s)]
*  The Post and now the New York Times both report that the contents of the 15 boxes include [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=233.84s)]
*  Correspondence between Trump and the North Korean dictator [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=240.68s)]
*  Chim Kim Jong-un as well as a letter that President Obama left for Trump when Obama left office [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=243.08s)]
*  According to the Times Tonight also in the boxes is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=250.08s)]
*  Amazingly this the National Weather Service map that he altered with a sharpie during a hurricane briefing in [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=253.32s)]
*  2019 now you will recall that he used a sharpie to change the projected path of a hurricane in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=260.32s)]
*  Order to match what he had incorrectly said about the hurricanes path in a tweet [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=266.2s)]
*  Dear leaders tweet obviously couldn't be wrong so an entire weather system had to be altered by sharpie to match it [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=272.48s)]
*  Yes, that sharpie gate map definitely belongs in the National Archives [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=280.68s)]
*  We need a record of it mostly because the people of the future will not believe that something so ridiculous ever happened [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=284.98s)]
*  As for how those 15 boxes end up at Mar-a-Lago instead of at the National Archives [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=292.56s)]
*  The Times reports that it happened during a hasty exit from the White House when [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  Instead of packing up like a president planning to leave office in accordance with the law should have been [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=302.32s)]
*  Quote mr. Trump had spent the bulk of the presidential transition try to find ways to stay in power [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=307.88s)]
*  At the time mr. Trump's aides were either preoccupied with helping him overturn the election trying to stop him or avoiding him [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=313.84s)]
*  you [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYc0Z6f18fk&t=322.52s)]
