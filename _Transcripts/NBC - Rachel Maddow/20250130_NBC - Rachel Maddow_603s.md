# How Americans ended up without an FAA administrator as Trump came into office
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58)
*  Speaking to reporters about the crash today, the president himself did a lot of swearing, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=0.0s)]
*  which was weird when you're supposed to be, like, comforting the nation. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=4.48s)]
*  He was swearing from the podium. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=7.12s)]
*  He also rambled an ad-lib rift on what the crash looked like to him and what it was like [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=9.24s)]
*  for him to watch the video of it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=15.32s)]
*  He scoffed at the idea that he would go pay his respects at the crash site, which, after [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  all, is just minutes from where he lives. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=22.8s)]
*  He said, quote, you tell me, what's the site? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=25.04s)]
*  The water? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=28.16s)]
*  Me to go swimming? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=29.16s)]
*  He also today, at length, blamed the plane crash on diversity. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=32.68s)]
*  Diversity hiring. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=41.28s)]
*  Literally at the moment, bodies were still being pulled out of the frozen Potomac River. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=43.88s)]
*  He was insisting that there must be something about this that can be blamed on non-white [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=48.44s)]
*  people having jobs. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=53.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=55.28s)]
*  Said it was just common sense. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=56.76s)]
*  While we're on the subject of the unquestionably and unerringly excellent performance of white [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  men in their job duties, though, did you see the press conference this morning from Trump's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  newly confirmed secretary of transportation? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=70.64s)]
*  Here was the very end of that press conference. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=75.0s)]
*  Here's how that one wrapped up. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=76.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=80.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=81.16s)]
*  Is there an acting FAA director? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=82.16s)]
*  And he just walks away. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=87.04s)]
*  Question from the reporter there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=89.24s)]
*  You might have, you can hear it pretty clearly. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=90.4s)]
*  Is there an acting FAA director? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=92.12s)]
*  And you might think that there is an FAA director, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=94.0s)]
*  Because there's this guy there at the press conference in the black jacket, the guy with [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=97.84s)]
*  the brush cut. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=100.76s)]
*  When he turns around and walks away, you can see a big FAA printed on the back of his jacket. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=101.76s)]
*  Despite appearances, though, that is not the FAA director. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  That is Trump's newly appointed, newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of Transportation, who also [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=111.44s)]
*  was plucked from the elite ranks at the tippy top of the meritocratic pyramid in this country, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=117.12s)]
*  by which I mean he too was picked off of TV. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=122.32s)]
*  Like Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, Trump's transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=126.32s)]
*  also demonstrated his competence for this cabinet position by co-hosting a weekend [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=131.28s)]
*  show on Fox. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=135.96s)]
*  Now, I don't want to sell him short. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=137.44s)]
*  He was also on the real world on MTV, so clearly the best. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=140.48s)]
*  This morning, while he was wearing an FAA jacket, he was also pointedly not answering [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=147.92s)]
*  that question about is there an acting FAA director right now? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=152.83999999999997s)]
*  Is there anyone who's directing the FAA right now? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=157.12s)]
*  He did not answer that question. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  He just walked away. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=161.92s)]
*  And that may be because as of this morning when that press conference was happening, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=162.92s)]
*  As of last night when the crash happened, too, there was no acting director of the FAA. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=167.0s)]
*  The director of the Federal Aviation Administration, like the FBI director, like the IRS director, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=173.0s)]
*  this is one of those jobs that's not supposed to turn over with each new president. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=178.24s)]
*  FAA directors are appointed for five-year terms, which means explicitly they're supposed [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=181.92s)]
*  to span multiple presidential terms. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=186.32s)]
*  But that did not happen with this FAA director. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=189.28s)]
*  left the job on Inauguration Day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=192.96s)]
*  And until this morning, Donald Trump hadn't gotten around to appointing anybody to replace [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=197.12s)]
*  him. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=201.96s)]
*  Well, why did the FAA director leave on Inauguration Day? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=202.96s)]
*  Less than two weeks ago, even though he had a whole bunch of years left in his term as [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=207.68s)]
*  FAA administrator, why did he leave early? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  Why did he leave as Trump was being sworn in? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  Do you remember this? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=217.96s)]
*  This feels like this was years ago, but it was only two weeks ago today. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=220.44s)]
*  I don't know if they figured out a way to blame this on DEI, right? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  If somehow somewhere someone interfered with the inherent white male excellence of SpaceX [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=228.16s)]
*  in order to make this debacle happen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=237.48s)]
*  What was this about? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=238.48s)]
*  But somehow, Elon Musk's latest rocket ship crashed two weeks ago today. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=239.48s)]
*  It was his huge Starship rocket. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=244.76s)]
*  It went up a little bit, not far enough. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=247.22s)]
*  It caught fire, broke apart in midair and showered the Earth with debris. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=249.2s)]
*  Elon Musk was apparently excited by the crash. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=254.64s)]
*  He described it as, woo, entertaining. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, people in Turks and Caicos are dodging the debris. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=259.84s)]
*  And the good people at the FAA, in response to Elon Musk's screw-up, they had to scramble [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=264.8s)]
*  to emergency divert dozens of commercial airliners, including from JetBlue and American and Delta, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  Spirit Airlines had a plane in the air that had to veer off course. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=279.04s)]
*  Also, same was true for a FedEx cargo plane. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=282.08000000000004s)]
*  Commercial flights as far away as South Africa and Australia had to be delayed or diverted [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=285.0s)]
*  as they had to put out these emergency warnings over a whole big swath of the Indian Ocean [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=289.3s)]
*  because of Elon Musk's mess. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=294.44s)]
*  This happened two weeks ago today, the Thursday before Inauguration Day. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  The day after the crash, so the Friday before Inauguration, the FAA, unsurprisingly, grounded [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=305.78s)]
*  SpaceX Starship program. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=311.85999999999996s)]
*  You cannot try to fly this thing again until you figure out what went wrong here and you [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=314.0s)]
*  fix it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=317.61999999999995s)]
*  We cannot have anything like this happen again. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=318.61999999999995s)]
*  You are grounded. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=321.46s)]
*  That was the Friday before the Inauguration. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=323.26s)]
*  Then three days later, Inauguration Day, the head of the FAA, the FAA administrator, was [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=325.97999999999996s)]
*  gone, gone from his job. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=331.09999999999997s)]
*  Elon Musk was rid of this FAA director who had grounded his rockets. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=333.18s)]
*  Because what? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  An entertaining little crash? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=339.3s)]
*  Which forced emergency diversions of dozens of passenger planes packed with humans? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=341.58s)]
*  In September, while Elon Musk was busy spending the quarter billion dollars that he dumped [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=351.06s)]
*  into Donald Trump's campaign to make Donald Trump president again, Mr. Musk had posted [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=356.97999999999996s)]
*  a picture online of the head of the FAA and had demanded his resignation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=361.7s)]
*  He needs to resign. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=366.58s)]
*  He had posted that because even before the FAA had to ground SpaceX altogether because [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=369.58s)]
*  of this most recent crash that Elon Musk thought was so awesome, even before that, the FAA [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=374.65999999999997s)]
*  had already issued a bunch of fines to SpaceX for ignoring safety rules and other requirements. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=380.3s)]
*  Elon Musk had adopted this as sort of one of his personal causes. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=387.14s)]
*  This was one of his crusades. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=392.66s)]
*  Get rid of the FAA. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=394.14s)]
*  Get rid of this guy at the FAA who's in the way of my SpaceX company. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=395.46s)]
*  He's been personally demanding that this guy be gotten rid of. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=399.26s)]
*  And so he got it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=403.78s)]
*  FAA chief was out on Inauguration Day. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=405.14s)]
*  And then ten days later, we had a horrific midair plane crash whereupon one of the cable [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=408.18s)]
*  Trump hired for his cabinet, wore an FAA outfit to a press conference, which made people wonder [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=413.42s)]
*  if he was running the FAA, which made reporters ask, hey, who is running the FAA, to which [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=418.34s)]
*  there was no answer, which apparently prompted Donald Trump today at a press conference to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=422.94s)]
*  surprise name a new head of the FAA for the first time because he'd never bothered to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=427.65999999999997s)]
*  do it before. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=432.5s)]
*  And yes, it is the FAA that is one of the agencies that will now be in charge of figuring [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=435.78s)]
*  out what went wrong in this devastating plane crash that killed dozens of Americans last [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  night. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=444.26s)]
*  But don't worry, Donald Trump says he has already figured out what happened. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=447.1s)]
*  What happened here was diversity. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=450.66s)]
*  And he's eliminating diversity. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=453.64s)]
*  And so we can all feel safe. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=456.38s)]
*  All our problems are all solved. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=457.82s)]
*  Because yeah, look at all the cable news hosts. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbs1F-L_58&t=460.40000000000003s)]
