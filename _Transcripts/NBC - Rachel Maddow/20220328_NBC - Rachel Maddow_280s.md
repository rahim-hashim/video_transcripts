# How To Understand The Air Raid Sirens In Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co)
*  All right, that was a sound we just heard moments ago as the city of Lviv declared [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=0.0s)]
*  it all clear after the air raid siren went off about an hour ago. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  It works in two ways. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=29.44s)]
*  You get the air raid siren and then you get the all clear. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  They sound very similar, but everybody here has an app that tells them whether you are [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=34.0s)]
*  in danger, the air raid siren is still active, or you're clear that was the all clear. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  Let's just discuss a little bit about how this works. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=44.36s)]
*  Just before we got on air, you and I both heard air raid sirens. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=46.8s)]
*  There's an app that people have here that tells you that it's still active. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=51.64s)]
*  And then while we're on the air, it could happen any moment now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=55.56s)]
*  It could happen in half an hour. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=57.96s)]
*  We'll get another set of sirens that are meant to indicate that there's an all clear. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=59.6s)]
*  The app will turn from red to green. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=64.28s)]
*  So what does the air raid siren actually tell us? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=66.52s)]
*  Well, the air raid siren covers a large swathe of territory. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=70.28s)]
*  It's not just Lviv. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=76.0s)]
*  It covers a lot of the neighboring of the cities around Lviv. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=77.38s)]
*  So it could be something incoming anywhere in a large region. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=81.48s)]
*  And obviously, as you mentioned, when that first siren comes on, it's telling people [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=86.76s)]
*  to leave their hotel rooms, leave their apartments, and go to a designated shelter that's close [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=91.26s)]
*  to them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=97.14s)]
*  And I have to point out, Ali, most of these places are not bomb shelters. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=98.14s)]
*  They're just basements. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=101.56s)]
*  So it's quite a basic shelter just to seek cover from flying debris or something. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=103.26s)]
*  But if something was to land right on top of one of those shelters, it's not going [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  to give the people underneath much protection. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  So once they hear that first air raid siren down to the shelters, and then, as you mentioned, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=116.68s)]
*  you'll get a second air raid siren and a warning telling you that it's safe and you can leave [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=122.98s)]
*  those shelters. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=128.1s)]
*  But that's also one of the causes of anxiety for all those people that are seeking refuge [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=129.1s)]
*  here in Lviv. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=134.5s)]
*  They've escaped these terrible situations in the east, in Mariupol, which 90 percent [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  of it has been decimated. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=140.94s)]
*  They're feeling somewhat safe here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=143.66s)]
*  Many of them mothers with young children, elderly people. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=146.2s)]
*  So at 3.30 in the morning when you hear an air raid shelter, you're woken up with a bit [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=149.12s)]
*  of a shock. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=154.34s)]
*  You have to shuffle down into a basement. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=155.34s)]
*  It's usually dark. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=157.64s)]
*  You don't know how long you have to stay there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=158.8s)]
*  And that unnerves people in a place they're meant to feel safe. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=161.4s)]
*  And I came in today during the day, and you're right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=167.8s)]
*  There's nothing about this city that you would think is a city under siege or under attack. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=169.92s)]
*  People are really going about their lives. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=175.9s)]
*  It's quite busy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=177.54s)]
*  It's a stunningly beautiful city architecturally. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=178.54s)]
*  But you were talking about these places people go into, these shelters. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=181.78s)]
*  I think there's one right over your shoulder there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=186.02s)]
*  They're just common places. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=189.1s)]
*  They're not bunkers typically. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=190.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=193.06s)]
*  They're not bunkers. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=194.18s)]
*  I mean, just where you are, I was saying at the location that you're reporting from right [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=196.66s)]
*  now, the nearest air raid shelter to you is that school just opposite you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=200.9s)]
*  And the air raid shelter is in a gymnasium in the basement of that building. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=206.1s)]
*  And you see the look of anxiety of people having to go there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=211.9s)]
*  They look kind of shocked coming down the lift, carrying whatever they could scramble [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=215.54000000000002s)]
*  together, their children, many of them with their pets, dogs, cats, going into these places [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=220.3s)]
*  and wondering how long they have to stay there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=226.26s)]
*  And even worse, wondering, oh, my goodness, is Lviv now a target? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=228.78s)]
*  Are we going to get hit the same way we got hit in Kiev, in Mariupol, in Kharkiv? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  So it is a very unnerving situation. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=238.02s)]
*  You mentioned the one behind me. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=240.3s)]
*  As soon as I heard the air raid shelter, I stepped out, air raid siren, I stepped out [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=241.94s)]
*  into the balcony. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=246.22s)]
*  And you could see people sort of dazed a little bit running into an underground facility. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=247.22s)]
*  I'm not sure what the one behind me is. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=252.98000000000002s)]
*  But it's not terribly comforting to have to do that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3KgUJz6co&t=254.94s)]
