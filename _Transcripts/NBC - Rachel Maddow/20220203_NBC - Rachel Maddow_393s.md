# Newly Uncovered Memos Shed Light On Trump Campaign's Fake Elector Scheme: NYT
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8)
*  We've got some interesting breaking news tonight from the New York Times on a story that we've [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=0.0s)]
*  been covering here aggressively over the last few weeks. It's this story of Republicans in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=4.16s)]
*  a number of states forging paperwork to try to cast fake votes in the Electoral College [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=8.8s)]
*  for Donald Trump. And you can see in the headline here on the story that broke just as we were [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=14.56s)]
*  getting on the air, memos show roots of Trump's focus on January 6th and alternate electors. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=18.16s)]
*  Here's the lead, quote, 15 days after Election Day in 2020, a lawyer for the Trump campaign in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=24.48s)]
*  Wisconsin received a memo setting out what became the rationale for an audacious strategy to put in [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=29.04s)]
*  place alternate slates of electors and slates where Trump was trying to overturn his loss. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=35.68s)]
*  The memo may not have been the first time that lawyers and allies of Trump had weighed the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=40.4s)]
*  possibility of naming their own electors in the hopes they might eventually succeed in flipping [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=44.32s)]
*  the outcome in battleground states through recounts and lawsuits baselessly asserting [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=49.04s)]
*  widespread fraud. But the November 18 memo, again, 15 days after the election, the November 18 memo [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=55.28s)]
*  and another one three weeks later, they are among the earliest known efforts to put on paper [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=62.96s)]
*  proposals for preparing alternate electors. The memos helped to shape a crucial strategy [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  that Trump embraced with profound consequences for himself and the nation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=74.0s)]
*  So we have been covering for weeks now on the show the evolving understanding of this scheme [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=79.76s)]
*  by Trump and friends to falsify the election results and try to keep Trump in power even [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=84.64s)]
*  though he lost. And part of that is this thing that is emerging with more and more clarity all [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=89.28s)]
*  the time. Part of the scheme was to send fake slates of electors to Congress. Pro-Trump [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=94.8s)]
*  Republicans in at least five states that Biden won, they got together and created and signed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=102.16s)]
*  forged fraudulent certificates declaring themselves to be the real true presidential [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=109.04s)]
*  electors for their states. That was in five states and two other states Republicans [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=113.92s)]
*  created and sent these certificates in, but they included language saying they were just a backup [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=118.88s)]
*  in case Trump prevailed in his lawsuits to try to overturn the election. But five of them just said, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=123.36s)]
*  we're the real electors when they really weren't the real electors. Now, they didn't keep it secret [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=128.56s)]
*  that they were doing this at the time, but these gatherings and these documents were largely written [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=134.64s)]
*  off as a sort of, you know, kooky Trump supporters engaging in, you know, wish fulfillment fantasies [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=139.44s)]
*  or at least just shenanigans. Wasn't until a few weeks ago that we started to understand that in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=145.6s)]
*  fact, this was a serious and coordinated effort across many states. The Trump campaign coordinated [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=150.16s)]
*  the effort in order to get these fraudulent slates of electors in front of Vice President Mike Pence [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=155.84s)]
*  on January 6th as part of an effort to pressure Mike Pence to use the fake Trump elector slates, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=162.96s)]
*  to count the fake electors instead of the real ones, to overturn Biden's election and declare that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump had won. So we knew that it happened at the time. We didn't understand that it was coordinated [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=176.8s)]
*  or how it fit into a larger, more serious scheme, but that has been evolving over the past few weeks. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=184.16s)]
*  All the while, the sort of origins of the scheme, who came up with the idea how it was communicated [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  to the people on the ground, to these Republicans who gathered and forged these documents and then [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  got them to the right places at the right time, the sort of command and control of this conspiracy [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=200.4s)]
*  has all been a little murky. These new memos published tonight by the New York Times shed some [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  light on that murk. They shed some light on how this all came together. Again, that first memo [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=210.56s)]
*  from November 18th, this 15 days after the election, it's a memo written to a Trump campaign [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=215.36s)]
*  lawyer in Wisconsin from another lawyer he apparently had consulted for advice. That first [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=220.24s)]
*  memo essentially lays the groundwork for the scheme. It says, the date we need to be focused [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=225.44s)]
*  on is January 6th. That's our last chance to overturn Biden's win in Wisconsin. But if we're [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=229.68s)]
*  going to do that, a slate of Trump electors from Wisconsin needs to meet on December 14th in the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=234.8s)]
*  Wisconsin state capitol and they need to cast their supposed votes for Trump because that's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=241.84s)]
*  what the law would require real electors to do had Trump won if their electoral college votes were [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=246.72s)]
*  going to be seen as valid. So that's the memo that happens 15 days after the election, November 18th. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=252.96s)]
*  Then there's a second memo three weeks later between the same two lawyers that lays out not [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=259.2s)]
*  just what the Trump electors, the fake Trump electors in Wisconsin would have to do, but what [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=263.76s)]
*  they would have to do in several states that Biden won that Trump was trying to nevertheless [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=268.64s)]
*  overturn. This was less than a week before December 14th, which is the date where presidential [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=274.4s)]
*  electors do have to cast their votes. That second memo laid out in detail what the fake Trump [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=280.64s)]
*  electors would have to do in each state step by step in order to have their forgeries appear valid [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=287.68s)]
*  pseudo legal under the law. We learn from this second memo why perhaps so many of the fake [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=293.44s)]
*  electors were so insistent on getting inside state capitals. Remember those fake Trump electors in [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=298.4s)]
*  Michigan pounding on the door and trying to talk their way past the state police because they [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=303.44s)]
*  wanted to get inside the state capitol building. They were insisting they were the real electors. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=307.84s)]
*  They had to get inside. Well, apparently in Michigan and in several other states, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  electors are required to cast their votes inside the capitol in order to be considered valid. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=316.88s)]
*  In Michigan, they did not get in, but in other states they did. The Trump campaign was reportedly [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=322.24s)]
*  involved in booking space inside state capitals for these groups of fake electors. That second [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=327.12s)]
*  memo, the December 9th memo also lays out exactly how the certificates needed to be signed, where [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=333.44s)]
*  the certificates needed to be sent to the National Archives, to the Senate, and that may explain why [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=338.56s)]
*  all those electors knew exactly what their certificates should look like and where they [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  should sign and where they needed to send them. Somebody gave them all the same advice for exactly [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=346.72s)]
*  how to do this. It seems like every time we think we know just how advanced and serious the planning [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  for this part of the plot was, new evidence emerges that shows the plot to have been even [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=357.92s)]
*  closer to being realized than we thought and more tightly connected to the former president [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=363.36s)]
*  in his campaign than we previously might have imagined. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkK3VIAqbj8&t=369.04s)]
