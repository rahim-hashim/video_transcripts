# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: June 10
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas)
*  So let's get down to the nitty gritty here. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=0.0s)]
*  Georgia became this kind of benchmark for principled Republicans refusing to go along with [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=4.48s)]
*  improper un-American machinations from President Trump. Governor Brian Kemp, Secretary of State [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=9.84s)]
*  Brad Raffensperger, two very conservative Republicans both nevertheless stood up to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=16.88s)]
*  personal pressure from Trump to overturn President Biden's win in Georgia. And of course, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=22.64s)]
*  all that pressure Trump brought to bear on Georgia Republicans and the ways in which [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=28.64s)]
*  those Republicans resisted, that formed the basis for Fulton County District Attorney Fannie Willis [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=32.8s)]
*  filing a huge RICO case against Trump and 18 of his co-defendants in Georgia. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=40.0s)]
*  So that's one story of the state of Georgia after the 2020 election. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=46.56s)]
*  Publicans standing up, the record of them standing up and what they had to stand up against [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=50.56s)]
*  forming the basis for this sprawling damning criminal indictment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  The other story of Georgia since that election is all the work that pro-Trump Republicans have [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=61.84s)]
*  done to make sure nothing like that ever happens again. To make sure nobody can ever again get in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=66.48s)]
*  the way of Trump seizing Georgia's 16 electoral votes no matter what the votes say. The most [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=71.28s)]
*  obvious thing Georgia Republicans have done is use every tool at their disposal to derail [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=80.48s)]
*  Fannie Willis's prosecution of Trump. In the latest development in that three Republican [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=85.68s)]
*  appointed judges have just put the whole case on hold while they take their time considering [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  whether Fannie Willis should be disqualified from the case. Thus guaranteeing that the Georgia [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=97.12s)]
*  prosecution will definitely not go forward against Trump before the election. But that's only the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=102.16s)]
*  start. In Georgia's most populous county, Fulton County, one Republican elections board member [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=107.92s)]
*  last month refused to certify the primary results there. Because you know elections are scary. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=113.68s)]
*  With the help of lawyers from a pro-Trump think tank she has now filed a lawsuit seeking the power [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=120.64s)]
*  to block the certification of elections which would of course throw November's results in Georgia [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=125.84s)]
*  into chaos. Which is presumably the point. Meanwhile just north of Fulton County, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=132.0s)]
*  Republicans recently started agitating to take over an elections board in Cherokee County. Now [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=137.76s)]
*  the board there like other counties in Georgia has always been evenly split between Democrats and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=144.24s)]
*  Republicans. But Republicans in Cherokee County are no longer OK with that. They wanted a full [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=149.36s)]
*  scale Republican takeover. When that was blocked they came up with an ingenious new plan. They [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=154.56s)]
*  decided they would replace one of the Democratic commissioners who had been nominated by the local [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=159.52s)]
*  Democratic party with their own choice. Their own choice for a Democrat. A new guy that none of the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  local Democrats have ever heard of. But don't worry the Republicans who run Cherokee County [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=171.12s)]
*  swear that this guy they picked is definitely a Democrat. The Atlanta Journal Constitution [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=176.72s)]
*  reported that the Republican Cherokee County Commission chairman quote, assured the board [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=182.0s)]
*  that the new member is a Democrat even if the local Democratic party is unfamiliar with him. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=186.96s)]
*  I assure you he's definitely on your team. I know you've never met and I picked him but [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=193.44s)]
*  trust me pinky promise. Meanwhile at the state elections board in Georgia, Republicans there [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=197.84s)]
*  just started writing a new rule that would allow county elections boards to conduct a quote [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=204.72s)]
*  reasonable inquiry before they certify any election results. So instead of signing off on election [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=210.32s)]
*  results as county election boards are now required to do by law, they would be empowered instead to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=216.16s)]
*  investigate those results as they see fit. The journal constitution notes that quote, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  the proposed rule doesn't say what a reasonable inquiry would entail before certifying an election. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=226.72s)]
*  Yeah why would you specify that? You definitely want every election denying Republican county [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  elections board member in Georgia just making it up as they go along calling their own behavior [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=238.32s)]
*  reasonable while the presidential election potentially hangs in the balance. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=243.68s)]
*  Speaking of that state elections board, one of its Republican members was ousted last month, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=250.16s)]
*  one of its Republican members was ousted after Trump reportedly spent months calling Georgia [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=254.72s)]
*  Republicans insisting that that election board member had to go because that person was not [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=260.72s)]
*  backing Trump's lies about the 2020 election and so of course the guy had to go. Trump's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=266.16s)]
*  personal involvement in remaking the Georgia state elections board is just one of the revelations [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=273.36s)]
*  in new reporting from Rolling Stone. Their new piece is headlined, Georgia is our laboratory [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=279.36s)]
*  inside Trump's plan to rig 2024. It details how Trump's allies are working to make sure [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  there will not be a straightforward election result in Georgia this year given Georgia's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  swing state status that absolutely could be a deciding factor in how this whole election [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=296.32s)]
*  is going to go down. The ultimate authority is the voter. The secretary of state was re-elected [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=300.96s)]
*  by the voters of the state by a larger margin than any other excuse me order order by a larger margin [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=306.4s)]
*  than any other statewide office. The voters order have demonstrated their faith and therefore I do [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=315.2s)]
*  not believe that at present we have the authority to oversee or investigate the secretary of state. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=324.0s)]
*  And Georgia's board of elections gathered to discuss launching an investigation [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=334.88s)]
*  into Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger who had the temerity to say no when Donald Trump [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=339.2s)]
*  demanded he flip the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. The lone Democrat on that elections [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=344.72s)]
*  board spoke out against doing this unprecedented investigation of Raffensperger as you heard she [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=350.48s)]
*  was loudly shouted down. In a new article titled Georgia is our laboratory inside Trump's plan to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  rig 2024, Rolling Stone reports this quote the former president and his supporters have been [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=363.76s)]
*  making concrete step-by-step progress in shaping electoral processes to his benefit. Across the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=368.88s)]
*  state MAGA diehards are devoting considerable resources to purging voter rolls, intimidating [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  election officials, employing legal dirty tricks and ousting Republican officials and election [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=379.68s)]
*  appointees who haven't been initiated into the cult of Trump. Georgia is the sole battleground [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=384.64s)]
*  state in which the Republican Party has total control over the levers of power. Over the last [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=390.16s)]
*  four years Trump loving elements of the Georgia Republican Party have wielded that advantage in a [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=395.36s)]
*  crusade to convert discredited election conspiracy theories into policies well ahead of election day [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=400.24s)]
*  2024. It's an alarmingly anti-democratic experiment that Trump planned and much of the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=407.12s)]
*  Republican Party hope to take national. Joining us now is Adam Ronsley. He's the reporter co-bylined [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=412.32s)]
*  on that sprawling Rolling Stone piece. Adam thanks very much for being here tonight. Appreciate you [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  making the time. Thanks for having me. So what are some of the steps that Trump and his allies have [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=423.04s)]
*  taken to change the electoral process in Georgia? So one of the most alarming ones that a source who has [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=429.04s)]
*  discussed this issue with Trump told us an attorney Republican attorney is they're planning to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  challenge the election result regardless of the result. You know we think of the threat to elections [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=444.0s)]
*  from Trump's behavior in 2020 as only occurring in the event that Trump loses. You know at the current [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=452.0s)]
*  state of polling Trump is ahead in Georgia if you believe the polling. But what Republican attorney [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=458.24s)]
*  who discussed this with Trump told us is that you know quote you can't let the left you can't let the left get away [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  with this cheating just because it didn't succeed. You know air quotes around cheating. And the plan is to challenge [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=472.32000000000005s)]
*  the result regardless of the outcome. And the intent behind that is essentially a permanent [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=480.6s)]
*  delegitimization of the election process. Right. It is heads I win tails you lose. And I think you know you had [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=485.76000000000005s)]
*  already sort of mentioned this a little bit in your intro is that one of the things that people should be paying close [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=492.36s)]
*  attention to is that refusal to certify in the Fulton County Board of Election in the presidential primary. Because one [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=497.8s)]
*  of the things that's very very notable about that is that the the attorneys who filed that lawsuit work for America First [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=509.16s)]
*  Policies Institute which is a very Trumpy organization filled with former Trump folks. And what you see in those kinds of [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=517.32s)]
*  processes is the legal January 6th in miniature. Essentially you're taking someone who is you know acting beyond their brief [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  and trying to essentially insert themselves into the counting and you know assessment of vote tallies. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=533.48s)]
*  Adam is this actually a fight in Georgia. You note I think importantly that George has a place where Republicans control all of [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=540.9200000000001s)]
*  the levers of power. We just played the sound of one Democratic member of the state elections board getting shouted down when she [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=549.24s)]
*  objected to what they were trying to do in terms of targeting Raffensperger. Is this fight joined where there is push [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=556.06s)]
*  pushback about against what they're doing or are they essentially running the table by changing processes to their own benefit. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=562.78s)]
*  You know they definitely they definitely have quite a built in advantage. And I think that's why Georgia you know relative to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=569.7399999999999s)]
*  other battleground states is particularly interesting because it is more so than perhaps any other state. A fight for the soul. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=577.9799999999999s)]
*  Republican Party particularly when it comes to their faith in free and fair elections. And yeah I mean even folks like Brian [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=585.8199999999999s)]
*  Kemp who was an absolute obstacle to Trump's attempt to you know illegally overturn the election in Georgia. You know Brian Kemp [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=593.0799999999999s)]
*  signed SB 202 which is a law that allows for a range of you know sort of procedural chicanery. Joe Biden called it Jim Crow [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=601.2199999999999s)]
*  in the 21st century. You know even folks who have proven themselves to be obstacles to some of the more overt aspects of it [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=611.34s)]
*  sometimes will just go along to get along. And so it they definitely do have an advantage and they are running the table in [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=621.0600000000001s)]
*  certain ways. But you do see folks like you mentioned earlier like and at Lindsay whose resignation letter we obtained in the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=628.9s)]
*  story you know people like that you still do have these kind of principal Republicans who are willing to stand up for what they [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=635.86s)]
*  believe in. But as you saw with the case of Ed you know he had resigned under a great deal of pressure from not just President [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=643.58s)]
*  Trump but from you know the grassroots of the party who believe in a lot of election conspiracies. Yeah. The bare fact that a [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=650.78s)]
*  presidential candidate is personally lobbying to remove individual state elections board members ought to be on the front page of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=657.32s)]
*  every paper in the country. It's been reported by Adam Ronsley reporter at Rolling Stone. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=665.1s)]
*  Yeah Adam Adam you and I want to say the same violent reporters on this piece again Georgia is our laboratory. Thank you so much for [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=671.38s)]
*  helping us understand this. Thanks for doing this work. Love to have you back. Thanks so much for having me Rachel. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=678.38s)]
*  We are going through some weird stuff right now. But we have gone through weird stuff before. And I do think that we can learn [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=685.3000000000001s)]
*  from it and that we urgently need to. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=693.98s)]
*  That's why I've been working on all these projects. That's why I've got this new podcast out. And I hope you listen. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=699.22s)]
*  But it's not just that the distant past in the very recent past when we got Donald Trump in the White House in the first place. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=705.4200000000001s)]
*  You might you might remember what what preceded that shock election result here in the United States in 2016. Our shock [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=711.1s)]
*  presidential election result in 2016 was preceded that year by some shocking and surprisingly right wing election results in Europe [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=718.74s)]
*  including the Brexit vote in Britain which happened just months before Trump's surprise presidential victory here. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=728.62s)]
*  I asked Ben Rhodes to please join us here tonight in the wake of what is now again another round of what seemed to be [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=736.1800000000001s)]
*  surprisingly right wing election results in Europe this weekend. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=742.66s)]
*  Was it right in 2016 to see right wing election results in Europe as a harbinger of what was coming for us in the fall of 2016. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=746.86s)]
*  As President Biden balances his campaign responsibilities right now with back to back trips to Europe. He just got back from Europe. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=757.18s)]
*  He heads back to Europe again on Wednesday. Do the election results from Europe right now this weekend have hallmarks that tell us [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=764.0600000000001s)]
*  anything about what to expect here and about how weird this is all going to get. President Biden clearly sees our connections to Europe [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=771.74s)]
*  right now as absolutely key to the future of the world. Just what's going on in European politics right now. Tell us anything to [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=779.34s)]
*  expect about the future of our world here. Joining us now is Ben Rhodes. He's former deputy national security adviser to President Obama. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=788.0600000000001s)]
*  He's co-host of the Pod Save the World podcast. Ben it's really great to see you. Thanks for making time to be here tonight. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=795.42s)]
*  Good to see you. First let me just ask you for some of our viewers who may not have paid close attention to what was happening in the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=802.3s)]
*  European elections this weekend. Let me ask you two questions about them. Do you think they are important for us to pay attention to. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=811.22s)]
*  And can you just give us a rough characterization of what happened in those elections. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=817.62s)]
*  Sure. These were elections for the European Parliament. So the European Union wide parliament. And so it's the only election that takes [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=823.5s)]
*  place every few years in which all of your votes. So it's a good barometer of where opinion is in Europe. I think the two [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=829.98s)]
*  headlines are the far right made noticeable gains in the two largest countries in Europe France and Germany. In France the [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=836.64s)]
*  National Front Party which is the far right party that used to be on the fringes of French politics emerged as by far the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=844.5s)]
*  largest vote getter in this election. And to just build on what you're saying Rachel this is a party that is not only far right. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=851.58s)]
*  They've had ties to Russia. They got a 10 million dollar loan from Russia within the last decade. So this is not conjectured. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=857.0600000000001s)]
*  This is reality. And in Germany the AFD party which has ties that go back into the kind of neo Nazi past of Germany that's never a [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=863.1s)]
*  good thing in German politics. Obviously they got over 15 percent of the vote. Not a huge total but very alarming given the source [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=870.9000000000001s)]
*  here. Now I want to be clear in other parts of Europe actually the center did hold. But I think the real concerning factor is in [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=877.5s)]
*  the two most important countries France and Germany. We saw these far right gains. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=884.14s)]
*  Do you think that it's right to look back at 2016 and see some of what was going on in politics in Europe as a harbinger for the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=889.58s)]
*  shock election result we got in the fall of 2016 when Trump won. Do you think that these election results should be read as a [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=897.14s)]
*  harbinger of what's coming down the pike for us this year. I absolutely do. Rachel the commonality between the Brexit vote the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=904.78s)]
*  vote by the UK to lead the European Union in 2016 in the Trump election was that it was a lot. It was a surprise. People did not [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=911.94s)]
*  think that Brexit was going to win that campaign. And they campaigned on a kind of right wing populist message. The slogan was [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=919.3000000000001s)]
*  take back control. And they ran against globalists and liberal elites and against immigration and was very Trumpy in its message [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=925.46s)]
*  frankly. And it kind of foreshadowed what we ended up dealing with in the fall here. I think Rachel the warning in this election. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=932.7800000000001s)]
*  And you asked me a question when I came on to talk about my book a few years ago about far right parties and their commonalities [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=939.74s)]
*  around the world. You asked me well what lesson should we learn. I always think about that. The lesson I take from this one [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=946.1s)]
*  Rachel is that they're incumbent parties in Germany and France that have defended essentially the status quo. Emmanuel Macron [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=951.82s)]
*  has been a defender of the European Union. Olaf Schultz in Germany been a defender of what we would call the liberal [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=959.6600000000001s)]
*  international order. People are not listening to that message right now. You cannot defeat these parties these populist [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=964.82s)]
*  insurgents by beating the defenders of the status quo. That's hard for Joe Biden who's president of the United States. But you [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=971.7800000000001s)]
*  have to simultaneously tap into people's dissatisfaction with globalization dissatisfaction with inequality sense that things [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=977.9000000000001s)]
*  are slipping out of control. It's not enough to just say we're the responsible adults here. You have to kind of get down and [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=985.7s)]
*  have a different message for how things are going to change. And I think that that's the warning sign that Joe Biden should [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=991.9s)]
*  hear. Not enough to run on status quo here. Not enough to defend even the things that we think are very important. You have to [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=997.1s)]
*  meet people where they are and people are frustrated. Ben Rhodes former deputy national security adviser to President Obama. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=1003.18s)]
*  Ben thank you for making the time. I feel like when we need to like widen the lens a lot and look at America in the world [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=1010.26s)]
*  you're almost always one of the first people I think of to talk to about these things. Thank you so much for being here. Thanks [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=1019.34s)]
*  Rachel. I can't wait to check out the podcast. It sounds great. I appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7jZZ5MfTas&t=1023.94s)]
