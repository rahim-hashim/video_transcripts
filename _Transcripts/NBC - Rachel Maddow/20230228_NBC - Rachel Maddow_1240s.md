# Watch Rachel Maddow highlights: Feb. 27
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I)
*  Move over George Santos in what is turning out to be a remarkable freshman class of new Republican legislators in Washington [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=0.0s)]
*  We've also got this gentleman Tennessee Republican congressman Andy Ogles. Mr. Ogles has described himself multiple times as an economist [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=7.24s)]
*  Now what is an economist really who can say they call it the dismal science for a reason [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=16.76s)]
*  But you might guess at a minimum that if you're gonna call yourself an economist that implies you have some training in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=22.62s)]
*  economics [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  Alas no news Channel 5 WTVF in Nashville has looked into that and discovered that in fact [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=30.48s)]
*  Congressman Andy Ogles has no degree in economics [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=36.24s)]
*  WTVF found that Mr. Ogles in his life has taken a grand total of one [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=41.56s)]
*  Community college course and economics which he barely passed and that was the extent of his collegiate work in the subject [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=46.88s)]
*  Congressman Ogles also said that he graduated [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Graduated from Vanderbilt's graduate business school, which would be very impressive [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=56.12s)]
*  In reality, he reportedly took executive education classes, which is a short-term non-degree program where you get a certificate [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=61.72s)]
*  Thanks for showing up not actually a graduate degree which requires years of commitment [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=69.96s)]
*  Congressman Andy Ogles also claimed that he was a former member of law enforcement who worked in international sex crimes specifically child trafficking [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=77.36s)]
*  That experience in law enforcement maybe was him serving for two years as a volunteer [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  Reserve deputy in one County Sheriff's Office a volunteer position from which according to WTVF [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=93.08s)]
*  He was released because he didn't meet the minimum standards even for that for good measure that Sheriff's Office said that congressman Ogles [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=99.16s)]
*  Had no involvement in international sex crimes [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=106.64s)]
*  Congressman Santos, I mean Ogles also claimed to have a degree in international relations [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=109.84s)]
*  Turns out that too is a lie and he's sort of now admitting that that's horse hockey little over a week ago [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  His office was saying it was a simple case of condensing a resume for the sake of brevity on the campaign trail [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=123.92s)]
*  And it's partisan hacks who were trying to turn this into a headline for clicks. That was last week now this week [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  We have a new explanation for his claim that he earned a degree in international relations [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  Congressman today released a statement saying I previously stated my degree was in international relations when I pulled up my transcript to verify [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=142.56s)]
*  I realized I was mistaken my degree [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  Turns out is in liberal studies. I apologize for my misstatement [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=154.24s)]
*  Who among us hasn't completely forgotten what we majored in in college and had to check it on the transcript [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=159.6s)]
*  I do wonder if there's something about the words majored in liberal studies that could explain why this Republican in Congress left that out of his biography and made something else instead [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=167.92s)]
*  What kind of studies did you say? What do you have an actual degree in? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=178.64s)]
*  Watch this space [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  A strong show of support today for a drag queen story hour event in the district [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=190.16s)]
*  Police keeping a close watch after tense moments at a similar event last week [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=194.4s)]
*  When members of the far right group the proud boys showed up in protest [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=198.56s)]
*  News source Derek Ward has more on how things went today [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=202.56s)]
*  The scene along Barracks Row the street closure the crowd the heavy police presence it doesn't immediately say children's story time [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  But neither does this confrontation outside of silver spring bookstore last weekend surrounding another children's story time [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=215.6s)]
*  As families started to show up for story time instead of facing a gauntlet of jeers they were guided by rainbow umbrella wielding escorts [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=222.32s)]
*  Still even the young ones couldn't have been oblivious to all of the police presence [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=230.72s)]
*  In Washington DC in Maryland all across the country now drag events need police protection and community escorts to shield people from violent screaming crowds of right wing paramilitary groups who now routinely show up to terrorize people at these events [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  And the stuff that's happening in the streets is sort of mirrored by or dovetailing with a huge surge in legislative attacks on drag performers and the LGBTQ community basically in every state where Republicans now hold power [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=254.24s)]
*  And Florida of course has gotten a lot of attention Governor Ron DeSantis there has led the passage of multiple new laws targeting gay people and trans people [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=272.24s)]
*  He's targeted parents with abuse investigations Tennessee right now is in the news for a groundbreaking draconian law they're about to enact that basically bans drag entirely in that state [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  In Tennessee performing in drag in public or anywhere where a young person might conceivably see you will be a felony punishable by up to six years in prison [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=295.28s)]
*  I'm sure Tennessee police will be delighted to have it among their new duties to raid like performances or plays or tick tock shoots or to accost people walking down the street [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=306.48s)]
*  To check that everybody's wearing what the police expect in terms of gender conforming underwear sure they're delighted that's going to be among their new responsibilities Tennessee will be so much safer [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=318.64s)]
*  And yes Tennessee may be out in front but Republicans have introduced bills targeting drag in over a dozen states and that's just the drag bills [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=329.12s)]
*  Republicans have introduced literally hundreds of anti LGBTQ bills nationwide this year nearly half of them specifically targeting trans people [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=339.28s)]
*  Iowa alone currently considering 19 bills including a drag bill and a don't say gay bill for schools and a bill targeting trans youth [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  In Nebraska a bill banning doctors and nurses from providing medical care for trans kids is also a top priority for Republican lawmakers [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  And in the Nebraska legislature Republicans hold nearly twice as many seats as Democrats so it has seemed like that bill would likely become law just as soon as they can get it to a vote [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=373.68s)]
*  Turns out getting that bill to a vote is going to be harder than the Republicans expected [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  I have nothing nothing but time and I am going to use all of it [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=393.68s)]
*  One Democratic state senator in Nebraska is taking radical measures to try to stop her Republican colleagues from passing this bill targeting trans young people [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=401.44s)]
*  And so far it's working watch work on the floor of the Nebraska legislature is at a standstill largely held up by one senator [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=415.92s)]
*  You cannot stop me [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=423.84s)]
*  For the second day in a row Senator Michaela Kavanaugh stonewalled [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=426.56s)]
*  I will not stand for legislating hate into our statutes it will be very painful for this body [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=430.56s)]
*  And if people are like is she threatening us let me be clear yes I am [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=441.92s)]
*  Kavanaugh promised to take every single bill to cloture meaning hours of debate on every single bill that comes to the floor [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=446.56s)]
*  Take your names off of that piece of poop [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=454.24s)]
*  LB 574 talk to the speaker demand good governance be better be who the children of Nebraska deserve [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=456.4s)]
*  Nebraska state senator Michaela Kavanaugh has brought the Nebraska legislature to a halt [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=468.4s)]
*  They have a 90-day legislative session there in day 36 [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=474.56s)]
*  She has vowed to use all the time in the legislative session to stop what they're doing [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=478.32s)]
*  She has vowed specifically to filibuster every single bill literally standing on the floor and talking dragging out debate to the maximum number of hours on every single agenda item [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=483.84s)]
*  So that Republicans will relent and rescind that anti-trans bill [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=496.4s)]
*  She's forcing the question is this what Republicans are going to use their government for [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=502.32s)]
*  Senator Kavanaugh says they can use it for that they can use it to try to get that one thing done [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=508.08s)]
*  Or the state can govern she says she's going to use everything she can to slow that government to a crawl [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=513.36s)]
*  She told the local excuse me. She told her colleagues quote. I will burn the session to the ground [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=519.12s)]
*  over this bill [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=525.28s)]
*  Joining us now is Nebraska senator Michaela Kavanaugh a democrat who represents the sixth district in Nebraska, which is in Omaha senator Kavanaugh [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=527.68s)]
*  Really appreciate you joining us tonight. Thank you [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=534.08s)]
*  Thank you for having me [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=537.04s)]
*  So, let me first just ask you um, if I got any of that wrong [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=538.72s)]
*  I talked about you a little bit at the beginning of the show and just gave you that intro here [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=542.48s)]
*  And i'm you know this much better than I do [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=546.24s)]
*  I just want to give you a chance to let to get me get me straight here if I got any of that the wrong way around [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  No, I think you have it right. I think that was pretty accurate and I i'm standing by that. I intend to talk a lot [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=554.24s)]
*  Well, tell me how this works in practical terms. I know that it's a 90-day session [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=562.32s)]
*  I think we're in like day 36 and with the way the filibuster rules work you can effectively [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=567.6s)]
*  Spend hours you can use up hours of the legislative clock and calendar [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=574.72s)]
*  For anything without anything coming up to a vote through this tactic by using this tactic [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=580.4000000000001s)]
*  What do you think you could logistically accomplish in terms of stopping legislation stopping the legislature from governing? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=586.6400000000001s)]
*  Well by my back of the envelope math we have [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=592.64s)]
*  approximately [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=597.02s)]
*  518 maximum hours left of debate this session [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=599.02s)]
*  And that means that we could pass potentially no more than 42 bills [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=602.5799999999999s)]
*  And that's not very many for the entire legislative session [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=608.18s)]
*  And this is a long session and that means we have to pass a budget [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=611.86s)]
*  so [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=615.62s)]
*  I'm just gonna [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=616.74s)]
*  Practically make sure that my colleagues [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=618.26s)]
*  My colleagues [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  Have to make a choice about what it is. They want to do what our job is and is our job to legislate hate [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=623.16s)]
*  or is our job to [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=629.16s)]
*  govern and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=631.24s)]
*  Work on tax cuts and work on the economy [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=634.04s)]
*  So i'm forcing their hand [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=637.4799999999999s)]
*  And you're calling the question as to what they are doing and what they do want to spend their legislative hours and their their capabilities [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=639.7199999999999s)]
*  On you're forcing them to choose [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=646.68s)]
*  This or everything else let me ask what it what this strategy entails from you [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=648.6999999999999s)]
*  I know you spent thursday and friday talking for hours [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=654.2199999999999s)]
*  On the floor. I understand part of that time you were fighting a cold and a sore throat [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=658.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean presumably this is physically kind of a big ask just for your for yourself being able to do this as a human [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=663.3399999999999s)]
*  Yes, um, well it turns out I had strep throat. Oh, which I didn't know. Yeah, that was a fun [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=670.4599999999999s)]
*  So I apparently I can literally filibuster through [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=676.4s)]
*  A virus that attacks your vocal cords and that i'm i'm proving i'm willing to do i'm willing to do whatever it takes [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=680.56s)]
*  Uh, this is too important [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=687.6s)]
*  um, I think it's important for us to focus on what it is [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=689.76s)]
*  We're responsible to do as state legislators as legislators across the country [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=694.0s)]
*  What is our job? Our job is public policy. Our job is not to legislate hate [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=699.12s)]
*  Um, but at the end of the day, this is going to hurt children [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=704.5s)]
*  And I don't care [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=709.38s)]
*  How sick I get I don't care how tired I am [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=711.0600000000001s)]
*  I am not going to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=714.26s)]
*  Look back on this moment in time and say I didn't do everything that I possibly could [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=716.02s)]
*  To fight for and protect children, especially our most vulnerable children, which are trans youth [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=720.9s)]
*  Your clarity speaking to me right now [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=727.38s)]
*  And your clarity on the senate floor on the legislation floor of the legislature and your clarity in explaining this point is pretty [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=730.6800000000001s)]
*  Unimpeachable. I mean you you're not beating around the bush at all [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=737.48s)]
*  I've been writing down all the quotes that I can that i've seen from you from the floor speeches [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=740.2s)]
*  Um, I want to annoy you. I want to gen you [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=745.24s)]
*  I want you to genuinely be frustrated to all get out with me [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=748.2s)]
*  This is how the session is going to be for every bill. You cannot stop me [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=752.2s)]
*  Take your names off that piece of poop lb 574 [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=756.22s)]
*  You've got a gasp out of the room and you said that if you want to inflict pain upon children [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=759.34s)]
*  I'm going to afflict pain on this body. I will burn the session to the ground over this bill [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=763.58s)]
*  I mean you are being very blunt about this. I have to ask if it has had [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=768.6999999999999s)]
*  Either backlash that you didn't expect in terms of people [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=773.18s)]
*  Not wanting this and not expecting this from you or if it's had a galvanizing effect in terms of people who [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=776.22s)]
*  Who feel the same way that you do about this? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=781.18s)]
*  I [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  Think that it has had more of a galvanizing effect than it has backlash [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=784.4799999999999s)]
*  I think that we have become so complacent in what we anticipate and expect [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=789.68s)]
*  of our governors that we [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=795.1999999999999s)]
*  Feel that those that are in positions of power are just not willing to stand up [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=797.68s)]
*  And so the fact that I and i'm not alone [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=801.12s)]
*  I have some wonderful colleagues who are standing with me [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=803.68s)]
*  And the fact that myself and my colleagues are standing up and pushing back so loudly and clearly against this [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=806.8s)]
*  I do think it's a galvanizing effect. I hope [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=813.52s)]
*  It continues to have a galvanizing effect. I hope that it it gives people hope [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=816.64s)]
*  I really want to give people hope. I really want our trans youth and really our lgbtq community [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=822.7199999999999s)]
*  Across the state and across the country to know that there are people fighting for them [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=828.64s)]
*  and that [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=833.68s)]
*  They should not give up hope because i'm not giving up [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=834.8s)]
*  Until I have nothing left to give [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=838.64s)]
*  When your voice is small in number it really helps for it to be clarion [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=840.66s)]
*  Which you're demonstrating nebraska state senator mckayla cavanaugh. Thank you stay in touch with us [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=845.3s)]

*  Thank you so much. I appreciate you highlighting this really important issue. Yeah [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=856.58s)]
*  If you own the mile plus long train that just crashed and created an epic still unspooling disaster [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=861.62s)]
*  With consequences that span multiple states and potentially multiple generations flowers. I'm sure are nice [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=868.52s)]
*  but the question in east palestine tonight is [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=875.08s)]
*  How much help is that community going to need not just now but for years to come and importantly right now [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=879.24s)]
*  Who will get to decide that who will set the appropriate monitoring and assistance in motion? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=886.68s)]
*  Who makes sure things are put right now? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=893.64s)]
*  Who makes sure things are put right now? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=895.74s)]
*  And for good joining us now is ohio u.s. Senator sharrad brown [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=898.78s)]

*  Senator brown. I really appreciate you taking time to talk to us tonight. I know this is a really busy time for you [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=909.8199999999999s)]
*  Thanks rachel, it's wonderful to be back in your show good to see you again. It's good to see you, too. Um [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=915.66s)]
*  What do you think people should understand about? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=920.86s)]
*  The impact of this disaster and the impact on people on east palestine [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=923.52s)]
*  That's maybe missing from the national coverage and the national discussion about this so far [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=928.08s)]
*  What can you see from up close from having been there just today? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=931.92s)]
*  That we might not be able to see from from a national media point of view [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=935.44s)]
*  Well, you your intro into the story was exactly right. It's it's what it's doing to people now. I we did a [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=940.64s)]
*  roundtable of sorts with [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=947.2s)]
*  1520 local people some you know from the local foundation [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=949.38s)]
*  city council [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=954.74s)]
*  sheriff [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=956.1800000000001s)]
*  commissioners [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=957.3000000000001s)]
*  Townspeople that we did at a woman's a woman owns a candle shop [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=958.38s)]
*  And I think three generations her daughter is helping her run it now [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=962.38s)]
*  They four miles away from their shop they own 40 or 50 beef cattle [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=965.82s)]
*  And what's that mean for them and people buying that so there's all kinds of down the line [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=971.1400000000001s)]
*  You know the water is is safe the mayor says that the EPA says it they all are saying the water is safe in the [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=976.16s)]
*  In the East Palestine water system, but a lot of people have wells [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=983.08s)]
*  We don't know about beyond there [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=987.68s)]
*  And we don't know as you say generation after generation what this means [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=989.68s)]
*  So the reason I said I'm there for the long haul is one to make Norfolk Southern [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=994.12s)]
*  Who by the way just announced billions of dollars in more stock options for their stockholders [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=999.08s)]
*  Especially their executives. That's how they give them such extravagant pay [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1005.3199999999999s)]
*  They were about to announce they announced that the day before said they were about to the day before the derailment [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1008.52s)]
*  So we're holding them accountable. That's my biggest job [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1013.7199999999999s)]
*  But also what do you do with the second generation and third generation so that's why I'm there for the long haul I [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1017.4799999999999s)]
*  was interested [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1024.28s)]
*  Today to see a letter that you co-signed today with the junior senator from Ohio the new senator Republican [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1026.0s)]
*  JD Vance now you and senator Vance obviously come from very different parts of the ideological number line [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1032.42s)]
*  And you're very different men and have very different approaches to things [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1037.34s)]
*  But that makes it all the more interesting to see both your signatures on this letter [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1040.66s)]
*  To the EPA and the CDC saying hey, we need to get out there right now and get a medical baseline [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1045.54s)]
*  Do do do voluntary collection of health indicators from people in this community? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1052.1s)]
*  So that if there is a health impact over time [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1057.28s)]
*  We have baseline data that everybody agrees is good data that we can use so that any health problems in the long run can [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1061.32s)]
*  be incontrovertible I [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1067.8799999999999s)]
*  Have to ask you about the substance of that request if I have it correct and also what it's been like to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1070.48s)]
*  To work with senator Vance on this [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1075.28s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know senator Vance well, but he's seeing the same things I'm saying he's talking to a lot of the same people [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1078.6s)]
*  I'm talking to he realizes the severity and the seriousness of this [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1084.36s)]
*  So we're teaming up even though we don't know each other very well. We are very different. We have very different [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1088.8999999999999s)]
*  Ideologies about government the approach to government, but we both see this is really important [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1095.1599999999999s)]
*  Right bill Johnson a local very conservative [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1099.86s)]
*  Republican congressman represents most of the river counties [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1103.26s)]
*  He and I have teamed up on a number of things too on this and you know, Rachel when you're talking [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1105.9799999999998s)]
*  My mind goes on this when you think about long-term impact to a bill that senator Chester and I wrote a [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1111.0600000000002s)]
*  bipartisan bill and passed what was called the PACT Act and those those soldiers hundreds of thousands of our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1118.3000000000002s)]
*  Were exposed to these football field-sized burn pits in those countries and are beginning to develop all kinds of illnesses [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1125.42s)]
*  We listed 23 illnesses based on medical [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1132.78s)]
*  assistance and medical advice [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1137.02s)]
*  Cancers and bronchial illnesses that could come from those burn pits and we're kind of approaching this the same way [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1139.58s)]
*  These can be two years five years ten years down the line and we want to make sure that we've covered those things [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1145.76s)]
*  So I bring sort of that experience of the PACT Act as a member of the Veterans Committee [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1151.78s)]
*  To this and figuring out how do we look at this long term? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1156.6399999999999s)]
*  Senator shared Brown of Ohio. It is really good to see you senator. It's been too long come back to the show [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1161.58s)]
*  Soon keep us updated on the situation in East Palestine and have your office keep us surprised as to what's being done at a concrete [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1167.28s)]
*  Level we want to keep it on the air sir for sure and I I'm I'm thank you and I'm planning on another trip in March [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1173.8999999999999s)]
*  I they're gonna see me a lot there and I've got a really good relationship with the mayor and the sheriff and someone [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1179.8s)]
*  Consul and some citizens and we'll keep talking by phone and then I keep showing up [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1185.28s)]
*  So that's really important that they know somebody's on their side on this and that's just my [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1190.04s)]
*  Mission and my job. Thank you senator shared Brown of Ohio. Thank you, sir [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38gi5C2aO7I&t=1196.6s)]
