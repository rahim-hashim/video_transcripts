# Exiting Biden Covid science officer hails vaccine success
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw)
*  Joining us now is someone who, for the last several years, has been at the absolute center [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=0.0s)]
*  of these questions. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=3.64s)]
*  Dr. David Kessler is the chief science officer for the Biden administration's COVID response, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=4.64s)]
*  and he'll be in that job for just a little while longer. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=8.32s)]
*  Dr. Kessler has announced that he will be leaving his post in the Biden administration [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=10.72s)]
*  soon this week. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=14.44s)]
*  He joins us now to talk about it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=15.44s)]
*  Dr. Kessler, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=16.92s)]
*  I know you don't do a ton of interviews. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  It makes me all the more thankful that you choose to be here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=21.16s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=23.68s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=24.68s)]
*  So talk to me about your decision to step down and the timing to do so now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=27.08s)]
*  Is the fact that you're leaving now linked to that expected end of the emergency declaration? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=33.28s)]
*  Does it indicate that the White House is on a kind of new footing when it comes to COVID? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=39.64s)]
*  No, I think the commitment is there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=44.4s)]
*  I have always believed in public service. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=48.68s)]
*  I grew up in the generation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=51.72s)]
*  It was an obligation. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=53.72s)]
*  It was a privilege to serve. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  But I also believe you come in and serve and there is a time to leave. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=57.28s)]
*  Let me assure you there is a great team in place. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=61.4s)]
*  You don't hear their names at all. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=67.72s)]
*  You know, the Jason Roos, Kim Armstrong, Steve Cha, Julie Turney, Lisa Barclay, they are [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=71.4s)]
*  there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=78.16s)]
*  They will stay there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=79.16s)]
*  I assure you this president is fully committed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  He's made sure that we've had everything we needed to get us to this point. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  It's been an historic accomplishment what this country collectively has done. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  My thanks to my predecessors at Operation Warp Speed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=96.56s)]
*  Never in the history of public health will we ever do what we just did. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=102.64s)]
*  660 million vaccines and armed 13 million antivirals administered, 600 million doses [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=108.56s)]
*  donated. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=115.88s)]
*  It just is an incredible accomplishment. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=118.44s)]
*  Where we are, the virus is not done with us yet. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  It will still evolve. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=125.2s)]
*  But I think the chances are low, not nonexistent, but low, that it will revert to the kind of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=126.2s)]
*  mortality that we saw two years ago. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=133.16s)]
*  To any skeptic, look at those pictures of China. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=138.44s)]
*  One of the major reasons we don't look like that is because of the vaccines we have here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=142.32s)]
*  Dr. Kessler, you'll be remembered in history among a lot of other things that you've done [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=148.44s)]
*  in your career. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=154.44s)]
*  The only person to ever serve as FDA commissioner under two different presidents. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=155.72s)]
*  You're incredibly important role on things like tobacco and nutrition and HIV and AIDS [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=160.4s)]
*  and your role in fighting this pandemic. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=164.28s)]
*  You'll be remembered specifically for having probably been responsible for keeping President [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=167.96s)]
*  Biden from getting infected with COVID before there were vaccines at that first debate. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=172.44s)]
*  In September of 2020, you'll be remembered for leading the task to get 100 million doses [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  in the first 100 days. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=185.44s)]
*  100 million vaccine doses distributed in the first 100 days of President Biden's term. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=186.76s)]
*  And those things saved innumerable lives. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=192.12s)]
*  But I worry now when I look at the low level of uptake on those bivalent boosters, the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  bivalent boosters became available in the fall. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=201.64s)]
*  Very qualitatively different kind of booster. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=205.2s)]
*  They protect us from the new kinds of variants that have developed since the initial round [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=207.32s)]
*  of vaccines came out. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=212.44s)]
*  I worry that we're essentially leaving 85 percent of the population vulnerable to new [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=214.52s)]
*  variants because people don't want to get the new boosters. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=221.88000000000002s)]
*  Our job, you know, I saw our job, my job is to make sure that anyone who wanted access [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  to a vaccine or an antiviral that were had that access and that it was easy to get. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  That was our job. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=244.84s)]
*  We put it out there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=245.84s)]
*  We urge people to get it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=247.28s)]
*  As you said, 80 percent of this country, 225 million people had their primary vaccine look. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=249.44s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=259.0s)]
*  There's cases are still XBB, Northeast, Middle Atlantic. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=260.0s)]
*  Now it's going to roll through the United States as a fraction of what we saw. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't know, Rachel, if you remember some of those nights that you and I talked, some [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=270.0s)]
*  of those nights were pretty scary. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=276.96s)]
*  Nothing like that is now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=277.96s)]
*  I think we're in a different place, but you're right. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  If you haven't had your bivalent booster, get it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=285.67999999999995s)]
*  If you're eligible for antiviral, if you get COVID, take it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  We have to be vigilant. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=295.76s)]
*  This virus is not done with us yet. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=297.28s)]
*  Dr. Kessler, in terms of those treatments, we've seen the monoclonal antibodies become [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=299.68s)]
*  less effective or not effective at all as the virus has mutated. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=305.28s)]
*  Should we have confidence that as the virus continues to evolve globally, that we will [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=309.8s)]
*  continue to have antiviral treatments that help us, that reduce the hospitalization rates [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=314.88s)]
*  and keep people from dying once they do get infected? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=320.32s)]
*  We have a very effective treatment on the market. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=323.8s)]
*  It's not perfect. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=327.64s)]
*  No doubt in my mind we have to do everything we can to get another antiviral as soon as [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=329.12s)]
*  we can just to have it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=336.56s)]
*  There's no guarantees in this business. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=338.88s)]
*  You and I live through the antivirals changing the course of HIV. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=341.92s)]
*  Yes, there's a great antiviral impacts a little bit, but we need to continue to make sure [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=347.64s)]
*  that that remains the case. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=354.92s)]
*  Dr. David Kessler, stepping down as the Chief Science Officer for the Biden Administration's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=356.44s)]
*  COVID Response. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=361.96s)]
*  Dr. Kessler, thank you so much for your service and for talking with us over these past couple [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=362.96s)]
*  of years. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=368.92s)]
*  I look forward to staying in touch and to seeing what you do at UCSF. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvf0NeA7xOw&t=369.92s)]
