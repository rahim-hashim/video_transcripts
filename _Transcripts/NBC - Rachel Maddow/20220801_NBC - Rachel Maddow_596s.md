# U.S. Kills Top Al Qaeda Terrorist Leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri In Afghanistan
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI)
*  After the 9-11 attacks, it took about 10 years for the United States government to get Osama Bin Laden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=0.0s)]
*  They got him in May 2011. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=7.0s)]
*  Now, as of tonight, we know it took another 11 years after that to get Bin Laden's brain. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=10.0s)]
*  To get the man who was Bin Laden's number two in al-Qaeda at the time of 9-11, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=17.0s)]
*  the man who took over as al-Qaeda's leader after Bin Laden was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=21.0s)]
*  The string of attacks and murders attributed to Ayman al-Zawahiri is stomach-churning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=27.0s)]
*  He was the ideological mastermind behind the turn of al-Qaeda and groups like that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=35.0s)]
*  toward indiscriminate mass murder of civilians anywhere, including Muslims, all in the name of Islamic piety. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=42.0s)]
*  And how he got there, now looking back at it, it seems like a straight shot, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=51.0s)]
*  but if you sort of dropped in at him at any time in his biography, you wouldn't have known he was going there. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=56.0s)]
*  He was trained as a doctor. He was a trained surgeon. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=60.0s)]
*  He was from a respected family in Egypt, born and raised in Cairo. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=63.0s)]
*  By the time he was 15 years old, he was a committed radical who wanted to try to impose Islamic theocracy by force. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=68.0s)]
*  He formed his first terrorist cell with the aim of overthrowing the government of Egypt when he was all 15 years old. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=75.0s)]
*  When Islamic militants did assassinate Egypt's president, Anwar Sadat, at a military parade in 1981, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=83.0s)]
*  Ayman al-Zawahiri was one of hundreds of Islamist radicals who was tried and imprisoned for that crime. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=90.0s)]
*  He was tortured for years in Egyptian prisons. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=97.0s)]
*  While he was there, he became an informant, supplying information on his comrades to the Egyptian security services. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=101.0s)]
*  He was released from prison in Egypt in 1984, even more radical than when he had gone in. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=108.0s)]
*  He nurtured the growth of his terrorist group, which he had literally founded as a teenager. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=113.0s)]
*  It was called Al Jihad, or Islamic Jihad. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=119.0s)]
*  He spent time after his release from prison in Saudi Arabia, in Pakistan, in Afghanistan. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=122.0s)]
*  He eventually became close with a rich Saudi Arabian guy who in 1988 had founded his own terrorist organization. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=128.0s)]
*  The Saudi guy was wealthy enough that he was able to bankroll much of their movement himself. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=136.0s)]
*  He also had great connections all across the Arab world. He was a great recruiter to their cause. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=143.0s)]
*  Ayman al-Zawahiri eventually became the Saudi guy's personal doctor, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=148.0s)]
*  which gave them a personal bond beyond even their ideological co-interests. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=152.0s)]
*  After the two of them supplied and supported the Afghan Mujahideen fighters against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=158.0s)]
*  around 1990 they moved on to Sudan and on to Yemen to establish training camps there for international terrorists. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=165.0s)]
*  At that time, though, Zawahiri was still really focused on trying to overthrow the government in Egypt. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=174.0s)]
*  That was his lifelong dream. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=179.0s)]
*  In November 1993, his group, Islamic Jihad, tried to assassinate the prime minister of Egypt. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=181.0s)]
*  They failed in that assassination attempt, but they did wound and kill civilians instead. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=187.0s)]
*  Two years later, in 1995, Egyptian Islamic Jihad blew up the Egyptian embassy in Pakistan, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=193.0s)]
*  killed at least 15 people, wounded dozens of people. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=200.0s)]
*  Two years later, in 1997, Zawahiri helped plan the Luxor attack. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=203.0s)]
*  This was a half dozen gunmen descending on a big Egyptian tourist attraction just before nine in the morning in November 1997. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=209.0s)]
*  The gunmen, those six gunmen, spent 45 minutes methodically massacring the tourists at that tourist site in Egypt, including kids. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=217.0s)]
*  People from Egypt, people from Colombia, people from Switzerland and the UK and Japan and Germany, 62 people murdered. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=227.0s)]
*  Zawahiri was the mastermind of that. That was 1997. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=237.0s)]
*  In 1998, Zawahiri wrote what amounted to a declaration of war against America. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=242.0s)]
*  He proclaimed that groups like his and his friend Osama bin Laden's group, al-Qaeda, and all the Islamist terrorist groups, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=249.0s)]
*  he proclaimed were all united as what he called the International Front Against Crusaders and Jews, not to put too fine a point on it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=256.0s)]
*  Zawahiri's declaration in February 1998 proclaimed it their mission to target America, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=264.0s)]
*  to target the United States of America and specifically to kill American people anywhere in the world. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=271.0s)]
*  That was February 1998 that he wrote that declaration of war. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=278.0s)]
*  Later that same year, in August 1998, they blew up the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=282.0s)]
*  In Tanzania and Kenya, more than 4,000 people injured, more than 200 people killed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=288.0s)]
*  Then in October 2000, they hit the USS Cole, a guided missile destroyer, while it was being refueled in Yemen. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=296.0s)]
*  17 US sailors killed, 37 injured. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=303.0s)]
*  The year after that, in June 2001, al-Qaeda, bin Laden's group, formally absorbed Zawahiri's group, Islamic Jihad. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=307.0s)]
*  He and Osama bin Laden from that point forward were no longer just fellow travelers and compatriots. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=317.0s)]
*  Now, as of June 2001, al-Qaeda was it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=322.0s)]
*  Zawahiri was bin Laden's second-in-command. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=327.0s)]
*  And also, informally, his brain, his strategic thinker, his ideological guide, his doctor, the chief operating officer of al-Qaeda. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=330.0s)]
*  Two days before the 9-11 attacks, in an operation masterminded by Zawahiri, a man named Ahmed Shah Massoud was assassinated. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=342.0s)]
*  He was the leader of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, the strongest leader in that country opposed to the Taliban. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=351.0s)]
*  Zawahiri wiped him out on September 9, 2001, doing a huge favor to the Taliban, indebting the Taliban to himself, essentially. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=358.0s)]
*  And then two days later, of course, they rained down hell on the United States of America on September 11, 2001, in Pennsylvania, in New York City, at the Pentagon. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=369.0s)]
*  This was the first wanted poster put out for Aiman al-Zawahiri after 9-11. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=383.0s)]
*  This is from October 2001, just weeks after the attack. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=388.0s)]
*  You see, the reward for information leading to his capture at that point was $5 million. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=392.0s)]
*  That would soon quintuple to a $25 million reward, largest reward offered for anyone on Earth. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=396.0s)]
*  After a U.S. Navy SEAL mission in 2011 took out Osama bin Laden, Zawahiri became the head of al-Qaeda. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=405.0s)]
*  And at that point, Zawahiri became literally the most wanted terrorist on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=412.0s)]
*  And you can see, if you look at the two different wanted posters, you can see that over 20 years plus, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=420.0s)]
*  while the reward did go up, you know, they didn't change the photo of him. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=425.0s)]
*  They didn't change much about what they knew about him or how to advise people to find him. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=429.0s)]
*  But tonight there is an update. Tonight they've updated the poster at long last. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=433.0s)]
*  This was just changed this evening as we were prepping to get on the air. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=438.0s)]
*  Put a big red deceased across the bottom of it now. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=442.0s)]
*  What we know is this. Aiman al-Zawahiri was back in Afghanistan, which itself is a story. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=447.0s)]
*  He was in a well-off neighborhood in the capital city of Kabul. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=453.0s)]
*  The New York Times and the Washington Post are reporting that the house where he was killed [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=457.0s)]
*  was owned by a senior member of the Taliban government known for having links to al-Qaeda. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=461.0s)]
*  The man's name is Haqqani, which is a familiar name when it comes to kidnappings [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=466.0s)]
*  and terrorist attacks and mass murder in Afghanistan over the past 20 plus years. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=470.0s)]
*  While the U.S. military no longer has anyone in Afghanistan, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=475.0s)]
*  the U.S. government was apparently able to obtain intelligence on Zawahiri's whereabouts [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=479.0s)]
*  dating back for several months. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=484.0s)]
*  They were specifically able to get information on the pattern of life at the house [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=486.0s)]
*  where they knew he was staying, dating all the way back to April. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=490.0s)]
*  And the reason that's important, the reason they were watching the pattern of life at that house [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=494.0s)]
*  was both to confirm that he was there, but also to try to find the right way and the right window [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=499.0s)]
*  to get him without getting anyone else, to get him and get him alone. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=503.0s)]
*  President Biden was briefed in detail on the prospects for a drone strike hitting that house. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=508.0s)]
*  The intelligence community reportedly built a physical model of the house that they wanted to hit. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=514.0s)]
*  They used that physical model to show the president their intentions and to brief the president [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=519.0s)]
*  on how the mission might unfold. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=524.0s)]
*  President Biden said in remarks to the nation tonight that he gave the order a week ago [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=526.0s)]
*  that they could strike when the right time and the right circumstances arose. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=531.0s)]
*  Those right circumstances and that right time apparently arose Saturday night just before 10 p.m. Eastern, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=535.0s)]
*  which was just after 6 a.m. Sunday morning in Kabul. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=542.0s)]
*  It was reportedly two Hellfire missiles fired from a CIA-operated drone. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=546.0s)]
*  It has been 20 years and 10 months since Al-Qaeda killed 3,000 Americans on U.S. soil in the 9-11 attacks. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=551.0s)]
*  It took 20 years and 10 months to get the two guys who ran Al-Qaeda during that attack. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=560.0s)]
*  Astonishingly, the leader of the Republican Party, the party's last president and their likely next presidential nominee, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=567.0s)]
*  said just this weekend that, quote, nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9-11. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=575.0s)]
*  He literally said that this weekend. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=581.0s)]
*  Nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9-11. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=584.0s)]
*  What was that all about? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=587.0s)]
*  Well, it took 20 years and 10 months, but actually somebody definitively has gotten to the bottom of 9-11. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fquqfIx5ctI&t=589.0s)]
