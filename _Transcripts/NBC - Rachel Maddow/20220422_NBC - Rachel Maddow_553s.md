# Raskin: Jan. 6th Probe Shows How Close Trump Came To A Coup
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA)
*  Joining us now is Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin. He served as the lead impeachment manager at Donald Trump's second impeachment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a member of the January 6th investigation [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=6.2s)]
*  Congressman Raskin, thank you for being here. It is good to see you again [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=8.8s)]
*  I want to ask you sir about these audio tapes that have been released of Kevin McCarthy. They've dominated the news cycle. They've got [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=11.76s)]
*  Potentially clear political implications, but that's not what you do. Your investigation is not about the politics of it [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=20.96s)]
*  How do those tapes those recordings what Kevin McCarthy said after January 6th about and possibly to Donald Trump have an impact on your investigation? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=27.779999999999998s)]
*  Well, they're a vivid reminder of what was clear to everybody who was caught up in the violent insurrection in the attempted coup [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=39.14s)]
*  against Congress and against the Constitutional Order, which is that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=47.5s)]
*  the president was [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=52.14s)]
*  deeply [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=54.5s)]
*  Involved in these events. He was at the center of these events and everyone believed at the time that there were [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=56.1s)]
*  constitutional crimes and statutory offenses [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=63.78s)]
*  Committed and I think people had the right sense at that moment that nothing like this had ever happened in American history before and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=66.66s)]
*  we had never have had a president who had actually gone to the lengths of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=75.66s)]
*  Insighting a violent insurrection against the Union and attempting to overthrow our constitutional system. So [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=80.9s)]
*  Minority leader McCarthy's words that were captured on that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=89.14000000000001s)]
*  tape in a discussion with the Republican Conference just to reinforce [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=93.34s)]
*  everything we're finding [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  Which is that this was an orchestrated premeditated? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=100.18s)]
*  assault on our system of government and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=104.7s)]
*  We have I think what will be a very riveting story to tell America about how this came about [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=107.97999999999999s)]
*  What were the causes behind it and what we need to do to ford our fortify our institutions in the future? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=113.86s)]
*  Against coups and insurrections and that last sentence is really the reason why anybody should care about this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=119.58s)]
*  Right because a lot of people make the argument that this is this is history. It might be an aberration [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=125.82s)]
*  It's an anomaly Donald Trump's an anomaly. But in fact, what we learned is that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=130.22s)]
*  The institutions we have strong though they are we're not strong enough to prevent an attempted coup [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=134.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this is a democracy and in democracy the people have the right to the truth about their own governing institutions [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=142.38s)]
*  And we came very close to losing it all on that day had Mike Pence succumbed to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=149.62s)]
*  the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=156.38s)]
*  Extraordinary pressure and coercion campaign being brought down upon him by Donald Trump and his lieutenants [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  What would have happened is Pence would have returned to send her [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=164.5s)]
*  dozens of electoral college votes lowering Joe Biden's vote total from 306 to below [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  270 in the electoral college if he had followed Trump's orders and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=176.66s)]
*  Rejected Arizona and Georgia and Pennsylvania's electors at that point [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=181.3s)]
*  It would have shifted the whole election into the House of Representatives where they understood we would be voting not by one member one vote [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=185.46s)]
*  But one state one vote and the GOP controlled 27 states the Democrats have 22 [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=192.78s)]
*  Pennsylvania split down the middle nine to nine [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=199.18s)]
*  So even had they lost the vote of Wyoming with Liz Cheney is the at-large [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=201.42000000000002s)]
*  Representative they still would have had 26 votes. They would have declared Donald Trump president for another four years [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=207.17999999999998s)]
*  He likely would have followed the advice of Michael Flynn his disgraced former national security adviser who was urging him to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=214.1s)]
*  Invoke the insurrection act and declare martial law and at that point [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=221.62s)]
*  He would have called in the National Guard to put down the insurrectionary chaos [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=225.22s)]
*  He had unleashed against us [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  And so it was really only Mike Pence refusing to play ball with the president he had served [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=232.06s)]
*  in such an obsequious way for four years and the valor and the heroism of the officers who stood between [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=238.22s)]
*  the members of Congress and the mob and the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  Insurrectionists that saved us that day and that's as close to fascism as I ever want to see America come to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=249.42000000000002s)]
*  And the people of the country need to understand how close we were to losing it all on that day [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=256.18s)]
*  And the that picture you just drew would be bad enough on the face of it [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=262.98s)]
*  If this were just Donald Trump and and and maybe some people around him, but I want to ask you about [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=267.62s)]
*  This becomes more important based on something you said during a panel event last night [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=273.7s)]
*  You said that the committee the January 6th committee is going to present evidence that proves that there was coordination [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=277.84s)]
*  Among then president Donald Trump and his inner circle and his supporters who attacked the Capitol on January 6 now [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=283.97999999999996s)]
*  That's a that's a big deal. Tell me tell me a little more about that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=291.41999999999996s)]
*  Well [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  There were two streams of activity and one was designed to try to overthrow [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=299.26s)]
*  Biden's majority in electoral college and you know, they use different tactics for that first [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  They went to court and more than 60 courts [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=310.94s)]
*  Including eight judges who had been nominated to the federal bench by Donald Trump himself [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=314.66s)]
*  rejected every claim of electoral fraud and corruption that the GOP advanced and in a civilized [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=320.38s)]
*  Democracy that should have been the end of it [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=327.78s)]
*  But they refused to take no from an answer from every federal and state judge [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=330.1s)]
*  That they brought their cases before and at that point they tried to browbeat and intimidate election officials as they did [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=335.38s)]
*  Infamously with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in Georgia. You'll recall. He's the one that Trump said to just find me eleven thousand [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=343.26s)]
*  1781 votes which was not Donald Trump trying to stop election fraud [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=351.46000000000004s)]
*  That was Donald Trump trying to commit election fraud and being caught red-handed [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=355.3s)]
*  They tried a bunch of other things but it all came down eventually to January 6 where they wanted Pence to declare unilateral [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=360.09999999999997s)]
*  extra constitutional [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=367.62s)]
*  Unlawful powers to consider and then nullify and reject [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=369.7s)]
*  electoral college votes something no vice president had ever dreamed of asserting before in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=374.18s)]
*  US history and something that all of the lawyers were telling Donald Trump he could not do and you even had the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=379.82s)]
*  Attorney general [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=388.02s)]
*  William Barr telling Donald Trump that his arguments were BS [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=389.5s)]
*  Although he spelled it out. So it was very clear. They were trying to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=394.21999999999997s)]
*  perpetrate a fraud against the American people with their counterfeit electors their lies about election fraud [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=399.09999999999997s)]
*  which he knew were lies and then their attempt to coerce Mike Pence and to [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=405.97999999999996s)]
*  mobilize the second stream of activity which was [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=412.85999999999996s)]
*  Insurrectionary mob violence [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=416.74s)]
*  Which left more than 150 of our officers with broken jaws and necks and vertebrae and ribs and arms [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=419.18s)]
*  And legs and traumatic brain injuries [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=426.94s)]
*  Concussions post-traumatic stress syndrome. They stormed our [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=430.06s)]
*  Doors, they shattered our windows [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=433.62s)]
*  They shut down the counting of electoral college votes for the first time in American history [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=435.78000000000003s)]
*  And so they interrupted the peaceful transfer of power and they left the capital a bloody mess [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=441.62s)]
*  Those two streams of activity came together and Donald Trump was being begged and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=447.62s)]
*  beseeched by members of his own family by members of his own administration [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=454.58000000000004s)]
*  By members of Congress from both parties to call it off and he refused to do that for more than three hours [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=459.14s)]
*  He was absolutely AWOL because he I believe and this part is uncertain and we got to figure it out [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=465.90000000000003s)]
*  But I believe he was trying to turn up the temperature on Mike Pence by [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=471.90000000000003s)]
*  Continuing to unleash and then incite this mob against him [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=477.7s)]
*  I mean even when Donald Trump understood that vice president Pence was in danger even when there were mobs [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=481.62s)]
*  Chanting hang Mike Pence. He continued to send out [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=488.26s)]
*  Messages in flaming the mob against Mike Pence [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=492.12s)]
*  so it seems clear to me that he wanted to continue all the way to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=495.36s)]
*  Complete what they were calling the Green Bay sweep [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=500.68s)]
*  Which is what I'm calling a coup because that's what the political scientists call it a self coup [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=503.16s)]
*  When a president decides to attack the constitutional system in order to prolong his stay in office and set aside the electoral [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  process [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=516.9200000000001s)]
*  Wow [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=518.12s)]
*  Congressman you said that the testimony is gonna blow the roof off the house. We're looking forward to hearing more of this [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=519.4s)]
*  Thank you for joining us as always tonight, Maryland [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=525.12s)]
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin is a member of the January 6th investigation as always sir. We thank you for your time [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=527.28s)]
*  You [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CHBCz9ARA&t=549.36s)]
