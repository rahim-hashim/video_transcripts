# Pattern In Trump's Pressure Campaign Emerges At January 6th Hearings
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk)
*  I think a lot of people that I've talked to now that we've all interviewed have said they didn't think that they were gonna be [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=0.0s)]
*  Surprised in these hearings because we feel like we know this story [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=4.42s)]
*  I've been surprised by how much I've been surprised and actually shocked like I mean because you know as you just said the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=7.12s)]
*  Escalation against Pence which was the subject to the previous hearing that buildup was dramatic and you really understood [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=13.68s)]
*  Okay, this man's life was in danger [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  He was it under basically threatened being lynched if he didn't do it [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=20.92s)]
*  They what was what he was told but now you see that this filtered all the way out [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=23.76s)]
*  And I think one of the things that was so effective about this hearing today is that each of the testimony started with this question [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=27.76s)]
*  You're a conservative Republican, right? You wanted Trump to win, right? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=34.6s)]
*  Yes, other than Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss and so you established that they were willing to menace threaten [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=38.32s)]
*  Threaten even to kill Doc's I mean you're talking about Brad Raffensperger's daughter [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=45.2s)]
*  Who's a widow at home with her kids then having somebody invade the home? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=49.2s)]
*  You're talking about Shea Moss's grandmother have people beat down her door and said we're making a citizen's arrest in Georgia a black woman [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=53.4s)]
*  That sounds like a lynching party [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=59.88s)]
*  I mean it was shocking to hear the level of violence that Trump was willing to meet out from all the way to Pence [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=61.16s)]
*  All the way down to Shea Moss. He wanted violence anything that that I mean, there's a name for that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=67.36s)]
*  It's called fascism. Well, I'm one of them and to that point one of the recurring themes [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=72.8s)]
*  We saw it in last hearing and we saw in this hearing. I thought your intro there about pressure campaign was really aptly done [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=76.56s)]
*  That you keep having these interactions where the where the people on the receiving end of the Trump arguments are like these are bad arguments [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=81.91999999999999s)]
*  The people on Trump end are like we're not really making arguments and there's just keep fundamentally just being like well, sir [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=89.32s)]
*  Actually, I looked that fat out that fact that's not doesn't matter [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=96.72s)]
*  Well, sir, that argument doesn't scan that theory doesn't work again [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  And again these lawyers saying this and what you realize almost sort of like horror movie pin dropping is like they're not trying to persuade you [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=103.0s)]
*  They're not making arguments to you. They are trying to force you they are trying to coerce you they are bullying you [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=109.8s)]
*  they are threatening you and so you keep having this moment of these kind of like [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=117.08s)]
*  Functionary sort of small-c conservative lawyers being like but wait that doesn't I have not seen the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=122.2s)]
*  We're doing here dude, yeah, and then it's like well then the mobs at your door [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=128.48s)]
*  We're gonna do it and if you don't accept the reason the mob will break your you know, Rachel one of the things [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=132.3s)]
*  That got namecheck today was the gang that couldn't shoot straight which is Jimmy Breslin's novel Jimmy wasn't credited [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=138.11999999999998s)]
*  The author never gets credit turned into a movie and it's about an actual gang of gangsters [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  Who are bad at it because they're stupid and Jimmy Breslin understood that stupidity runs very high in gang world [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=150.5s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani and the piece that we just saw there where [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=157.16s)]
*  Speaker Brian Cutler, Pennsylvania [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Is refusing to take his call he's made it clear he's communicated through people who Giuliani [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  Do not call me now [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=170.44000000000003s)]
*  He couldn't make it clearer that he's not gonna be part of the gang and the gang that couldn't shoot straight keeps calling him [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, not just calling him [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=180.3s)]
*  leaving tape [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=182.3s)]
*  recorded voicemails from Rudy Giuliani [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=184.3s)]
*  Jimmy Breslin wouldn't have written that himself and then they organized a mob to go to his house [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5cmEkdCENk&t=187.68s)]
