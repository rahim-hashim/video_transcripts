# How one man took on Trump's improper firings and saved the jobs of thousands of people
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk)
*  In all of these fights against what appear to be these illegal mass firings and these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=0.0s)]
*  efforts to unilaterally close down and turn off parts of the government, the materially [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  most consequential one of all of them is one that was obtained because of one man whose [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=9.68s)]
*  name is Hampton Dellinger. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=14.44s)]
*  Trump tried to fire him in the first week in February. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=16.68s)]
*  Mr. Dellinger fought it immediately. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=21.2s)]
*  He fought it long enough and hard enough that while he was able to retain his post thanks [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=23.92s)]
*  to a judge's order, still under fire from Trump. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  He succeeded in enlisting the Merit Systems Protection Board to reverse thousands of baseless [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=34.2s)]
*  firings of so-called probationary employees. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=41.56s)]
*  Among the direct results of what Hampton Dellinger did are more than 5,000 people at USDA who [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=44.96s)]
*  yesterday were told they must be reinstated to their jobs. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=51.0s)]
*  Hampton Dellinger today himself announced that he is ending his one man fight to stay [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  at his post at the Office of Special Counsel which looks after whistleblower rights, which [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  looks after the rights of government employees to not be fired for corrupt or improper reasons. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=67.16s)]
*  He left that job today after an appeals court ruling basically made clear that he must. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=72.52s)]
*  But take him as a case study here because his one man, one month fight to not go quietly [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=80.94s)]
*  saved the jobs of thousands of people who were improperly fired by Trump. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=91.46s)]
*  And that fight set the bar and set the tone for what it means to refuse to go quietly [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=97.5s)]
*  and to make as much good trouble as you can every single day that you can for as long [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=104.18s)]
*  as you can. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=108.74s)]
*  Joining us now for his first interview since ending this fight is Hampton Dellinger. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=110.18s)]
*  He's now the former head of the Office of Special Counsel. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=113.98s)]
*  Mr. Dellinger, it's really nice to meet you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=116.7s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=118.18s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=119.18s)]
*  I'm sorry that this was your last day. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=120.18s)]
*  Yeah, I'd rather be at work. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=121.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=123.38s)]
*  Well, tell me about your job. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=124.38s)]
*  Tell me what your job was. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=125.38s)]
*  Well, for almost a year, I was the place that if you're a federal government whistleblower [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=126.38s)]
*  and you see wrongdoing happening on your job in the government, you could come to my office [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=131.46s)]
*  and report it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  I could initiate an investigation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=137.58s)]
*  And if you happen to be retaliated against for blowing the whistle, I could help protect [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=139.5s)]
*  you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=143.46s)]
*  That job, for obvious reasons when you think about checks and balances, is an independent [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=144.94s)]
*  job, one in which Congress created the job. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=149.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=153.62s)]
*  50 years ago. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=154.62s)]
*  Congress created the job and created it in such a way that the president can come in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=155.62s)]
*  and say, I don't like what this guy is doing protecting these whistleblowers. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=158.58s)]
*  Get him out. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=162.1s)]
*  I want my own guy in there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=163.1s)]
*  Specifically, the design of the job, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=164.1s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=166.14s)]
*  For 50 years, presidents had respected that design, had respected that there would be [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=167.77999999999997s)]
*  a limited but important role for my office and that we would have a measure of protection. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=172.1s)]
*  So we wouldn't worry about losing our jobs when we stood up for other federal employees [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  who are unlawfully losing their jobs. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=181.27999999999997s)]
*  When the president, February 7th, told you that you were fired, had you been expecting [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=184.7s)]
*  it? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=192.14s)]
*  Did you already have a plan in place for what you would do in that moment? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=193.14s)]
*  Yes and no. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=196.22s)]
*  I had seen inspectors general really capable, hardworking IGs be ousted. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=197.7s)]
*  I knew that there was a general view that they didn't want independent watchdogs in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=204.82s)]
*  the executive branch, but I also knew the history of my office and that had been around [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=210.38s)]
*  for 50 years and courts had respected that independence for 50 years. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=214.42s)]
*  So when I got the email saying, you're fired, thank you for your service, I didn't feel [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=219.12s)]
*  like they meant it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=223.45999999999998s)]
*  I also didn't feel like it merited a response. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=224.94s)]
*  So I went back and forth and I'm someone who believes in the presidency. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=227.94s)]
*  I want to see every American president succeed, but I also knew that my firing violated a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  law, a law that had been on the books and I just couldn't walk away in the face of that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  You fought for a solid month since that happened. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=244.10000000000002s)]
*  Your case took one trip to the Supreme Court already. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=250.62s)]
*  Back down to lower courts, you got an adverse appeals court ruling yesterday which led to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=253.82s)]
*  your decision to effectively stop your fight. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=258.78s)]
*  Did you feel like you had no choice in terms of stopping it, that there might be additional [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=262.38s)]
*  harm done to the things that you care about and that you were trying to protect if you [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  stuck with it and kept fighting? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=269.26s)]
*  Certainly that was an aspect of it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=271.38s)]
*  I had a three-judge panel that was somewhat conservative and that mirrors the Supreme [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=272.78s)]
*  Court. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=277.26s)]
*  I knew that it could be an uphill fight even though I disagree with the court's ruling [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=278.98s)]
*  and I would disagree with the Supreme Court if they found my position unconstitutional. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=282.5s)]
*  But the other issue, Rachel, is it was going to be months, maybe a year before I'd get [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=286.9s)]
*  a final answer. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=291.38s)]
*  I'd be on the sidelines the whole time and I've seen the damage over the past month or [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=292.38s)]
*  so that can happen in days, sometimes even hours to these federal agencies when the laws [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  aren't being followed. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=303.02s)]
*  The idea of trying to come back in a year and fix what I think might be broken forever [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=305.14s)]
*  in terms of the independence of my agency was not something that I thought I could do. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=311.86s)]
*  You talk about not wanting to be on the sidelines for the duration of that kind of a fight, waiting [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=317.38s)]
*  for something to get up to and through the United States Supreme Court. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  What does not being on the sidelines mean? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=326.9s)]
*  What do you plan to do now today's day one out of government service? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=328.78s)]
*  Rest, maybe, but I tell you, I can't let go of yesterday. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=333.82s)]
*  I started out in the morning and helped get 6,000 unlawfully fired federal employees their [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=338.46s)]
*  jobs back. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=344.26s)]
*  And at the end of the day, I lost my job. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  And so it was my best day at work and my worst day at work on the same day. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=349.86s)]
*  So I'm going to hold onto that for a little bit. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=355.3s)]
*  Well don't hold onto it for too long. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=357.74s)]
*  I mean, you do, you have seen, you have seen things. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  A, the skills that got you this job in the first place and that you allowed you to perform [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=362.85999999999996s)]
*  those duties for the past year, but also what you have seen about what it means to fight. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=366.26s)]
*  It's part of the reason I wanted to talk to you tonight because you embody an example [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  here of what it is to stand up and put your name as the plaintiff on that suit against [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=375.62s)]
*  the government to stand up for the way the American people ought to be treated. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=382.5s)]
*  We very rarely ask individual human beings to say, I, the named plaintiff, am here to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=386.34s)]
*  stand up for the people against the government that is mistreating them. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=392.61999999999995s)]
*  And it takes something. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=396.34s)]
*  A, it takes resources. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=397.53999999999996s)]
*  You had help in filing the suit. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=399.2s)]
*  I did. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=401.14s)]
*  I had brilliant lawyers who assisted me. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=402.14s)]
*  I got a lot of support from whistleblower advocacy groups, from military veterans groups, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=403.41999999999996s)]
*  because a lot of my job was focused on the VA, which is why, by the way, I think it makes [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=408.38s)]
*  no sense for the president to put in the secretary of the VA. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=413.06s)]
*  I honor his military service, but he's got a big job on his own to do. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=416.98s)]
*  And the idea that he could be in my job investigating himself is just the essence of the conflict [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=421.54s)]
*  of interest. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=426.98s)]
*  They dual-hatted the VA secretary and your job. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=427.98s)]
*  That is the plan, as of a couple of weeks ago. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=430.34000000000003s)]
*  But to your broader point, you know, I'm just one person, and I was inspired by others. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=433.62s)]
*  I saw the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York stand up for the rule [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=438.9s)]
*  of law and not sign off on something she didn't think was right. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=444.5s)]
*  Danielle Sassoon. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=448.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=449.5s)]
*  I saw the inspector's general, who I'd worked with hand in hand for a year, being ousted, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=450.5s)]
*  and I knew their integrity and their talents. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=455.56s)]
*  And I feel like the easiest thing for me to do was just to follow the law. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=458.41999999999996s)]
*  That's what I'd done every day in my job. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=463.34s)]
*  And I knew my firing violated the law. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=465.46s)]
*  So I just held true to that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=468.02s)]
*  I listened as I was thinking about whether to follow the suit or not to shelter in the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=470.02s)]
*  storm by Bob Dylan. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=475.64s)]
*  And I just think for a lawyer, the shelter in the storm, in chaos and uncertainty, is [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=477.71999999999997s)]
*  the law. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's just what I've tried to hold on to. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  I have been not thinking about it in that poetic a term, but I have been thinking about [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=485.67999999999995s)]
*  the peculiar and insidious evil of arbitrary action. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=496.4s)]
*  When you got those 5,000-plus employees at USDA their jobs back, part of the reason you [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=497.52s)]
*  got them their jobs back is because they were fired for arbitrary reasons. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=504.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=506.84s)]
*  And we've seen that everywhere. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=507.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=508.84s)]
*  We've seen that from, you know, you see CDC employees get fired one day, rehired the next [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=509.84s)]
*  day, fired the next day, rehired the next day. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's arbitrary action. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=514.36s)]
*  They're being told it's for poor performance. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=515.56s)]
*  It's clearly not. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  And there's something that's just dumb about that, but there's also something, I think, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=518.76s)]
*  because when the government behaves arbitrarily like that, it's telling you there's no refuge [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=525.56s)]
*  for you in the law and there's no refuge for you in order. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=531.64s)]
*  We will act, there will be no law and order for you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=536.0s)]
*  We'll use the law against you whenever we can, but there's no refuge for you there. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=538.84s)]
*  There's nothing that you can turn to to ask for fairness. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=544.36s)]
*  And that arbitrary and misspelled and dumb and instantly retracted and reinstated and [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  untrackable and anonymous nature of what they're doing, I feel like gives it some of its authoritarian [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=555.48s)]
*  sort of cadence and feel. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, we only have a government because of laws. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=564.44s)]
*  We have a president because of the Supreme Rule Book, the Constitution. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=567.36s)]
*  So everything is created and structured by a set of rules, a set of laws. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=571.32s)]
*  So that's what I think we have to hold on to. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=577.64s)]
*  And many individuals are putting it front and center. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=580.4s)]
*  Many individual judges are retaining the essence, I think, of what makes us America. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=584.48s)]
*  But the other thing about federal employees that don't want to be lost, Rachel, is that [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=590.64s)]
*  30 percent of them, more than 600,000, are military veterans. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=595.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=600.0s)]
*  They wore the uniform. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=600.48s)]
*  They put their lives on the line for our country. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=601.84s)]
*  They come back to federal service, their nurses, their TSA agents, their FBI agents. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=604.8s)]
*  And so the least we can do is treat them with respect and treat them lawfully. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=611.68s)]
*  Let me ask you one last question here about the law. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=617.5999999999999s)]
*  And it is about something that happened today. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=619.5999999999999s)]
*  There was no cabinet meeting on the president's schedule today, but he nevertheless sort of [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=621.68s)]
*  announced after the fact that there had been a cabinet meeting and there started to emerge [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  some reporting about what happened. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=629.3599999999999s)]
*  The president reportedly, or at least says now, that what he told his agency heads, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=631.6s)]
*  his cabinet officials today, is that Elon Musk can no longer order firings, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=637.52s)]
*  that the agencies must do it themselves, and Elon Musk is only there to advise. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=642.48s)]
*  This obviously cuts against what Elon Musk has been doing. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  There was also a strange moment in the State of the Union where the president described [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=652.32s)]
*  Elon Musk as the head of DOGE, and then immediately court filings were updated to reflect that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=655.68s)]
*  because the government had sworn to federal courts that he wasn't the head of DOGE. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=660.4s)]
*  This overall idea of firing all the probationary employees, of Elon Musk's anonymous group coming [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=665.52s)]
*  in and ordering shutdowns of agencies and firings of whole categories of people, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=670.8s)]
*  do you think it is running into a legal cul-de-sac? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=675.92s)]
*  Are we getting to the point where the law is going to start to trip up these efforts [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=679.52s)]
*  in a more wholesale way? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=684.24s)]
*  I think the law should. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=686.0799999999999s)]
*  I think Congress should step up. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=687.6s)]
*  Congress has the power of the purse. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=690.56s)]
*  The president can reorganize government, but there are a set of rules that govern how [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=692.24s)]
*  that reorganization should take place. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=699.4399999999999s)]
*  All I was asking is that the rules be followed. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=701.6s)]
*  I think it's a simple truth, and I think it's one that courts will hold on to and vindicate, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=704.88s)]
*  and I hope Congress does their part as well. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=710.48s)]
*  Hampton Dellinger, as of today, the former head of the Office of Special Counsel and [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=713.92s)]
*  somebody whose story is going to be told for a very long time because of what you did and [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=718.64s)]
*  because of its effects. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=722.8s)]
*  I know you have some wounds to lick and you need probably some rest, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=724.96s)]
*  but don't go too far. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=728.16s)]
*  The country needs you. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=729.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=730.88s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMQiIpMrSFk&t=731.36s)]
