Video Description: George Papadopoulos was literally the person who triggered the Trump Russia investigation, but has mostly been a side character in the bigger Trump story.

# Where are they now? The man at the start of the Trump Russia investigation comes full circle
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo)
*  Do you remember the name George Papadopoulos? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=0.0s)]
*  George Papadopoulos, you might remember, he was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=3.12s)]
*  in 2016. And it was his meetings with Russian government intermediaries who were offering dirt [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=7.12s)]
*  on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign that started the whole investigation into Russia [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=15.92s)]
*  interfering in that election to try to hurt Clinton and help Trump. The whole thing went back [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  to George Papadopoulos talking to intermediaries for the Russian government. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=29.04s)]
*  The U.S. intelligence and law enforcement were curious, why would Russia be offering [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=33.6s)]
*  information about Hillary Clinton to somebody associated with the Trump campaign? Let's look [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  into it. That's how the whole thing started. George Papadopoulos pled guilty to lying to the FBI [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=42.4s)]
*  about his Russian contacts. He went to prison after he got out of the crowbar hotel. He and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  his wife, you also might remember, they had a weird Hollywood interlude where they were maybe [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=53.2s)]
*  going to star in a reality TV show that involves towels. I don't know. That seemed to have not [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=61.92s)]
*  panned out. Reportedly, though, they now have found a new gig. Now, in time for the 2024 [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=67.76s)]
*  presidential election, guess what their new gig is? Running a Russian propaganda website. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=74.56s)]
*  Who could have predicted? From the Guardian newspaper, quote, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=82.48s)]
*  working alongside contributors for Kremlin state media, the former Donald Trump policy aide, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=85.92s)]
*  George Papadopoulos, his wife, Simona, and others have become editorial board members of a pro-Russian [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=91.12s)]
*  website that spreads debunked conspiracy theories about the war in Ukraine and election fraud and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=97.28s)]
*  vaccines. The outlet's articles have been shared on social media by the conspiracist Alex Jones, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=103.92s)]
*  by former Trump aide Roger Stone. Nearly half of the outlet's board members are either former [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=109.52s)]
*  aide surrogates or fake electors for Trump's previous two presidential campaigns. Other [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=115.52s)]
*  board members include a former journalist for Russian state-owned news agency Sputnik, also [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=121.92s)]
*  an advisor to the guy who Putin appointed to rule over part of the territory Russia invaded and stole [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=128.4s)]
*  from Ukraine, a man who has since been sanctioned by the U.S. government for that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=134.88s)]
*  All of these Trump guys who repeatedly get involved in Russian influence operations, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=141.6s)]
*  it's funny how it keeps happening, for one. But there is apparently one thing that has changed [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=146.24s)]
*  over time, and that is that they are really not embarrassed about it anymore. They find it not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=151.28s)]
*  even worth hiding anymore. Among the recent offerings from George Papadopoulos and his wife, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=155.2s)]
*  there's his wife's interview with a guy who is sanctioned by the U.S. government as a Russian [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=162.72s)]
*  agent because he stovepiped false disinformation about Joe Biden and Ukraine straight to Trump's [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  lawyer Rudy Giuliani during the 2020 campaign. In 2016, we remember what Russia did to try to, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=176.4s)]
*  you know, hurt the Clinton campaign and help Trump get into the White House. In 2024, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=185.68s)]
*  the Office of the Director of National Intelligence says that Russia is doing it again. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=190.16s)]
*  The Justice Department just brought charges related to what the Russian influence operation [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=193.2s)]
*  for Trump's benefit looks like in 2024. But in 2020, what happened was there was a Russian [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=197.92s)]
*  influence operation to try to sell this idea that there was some scandal involving Joe Biden [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=204.72s)]
*  and his son Hunter and Ukraine and a Ukrainian energy company. That was what they did in 2020. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=210.96s)]
*  And George Papadopoulos and his wife are apparently still trying to sell it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=217.2s)]
*  So, boys, it's a great time to be releasing a movie, a feature documentary about the guy who [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=222.64s)]
*  is at the center of that whole Russian operation in 2020, which did, in fact, lead to Donald Trump's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=227.67999999999998s)]
*  first impeachment. The movie is called From Russia with Lev. It's the first feature documentary from [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  my production company, Surprise Inside. I want to thank everybody who tuned in to watch the premiere [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=239.6s)]
*  From Russia with Lev. Lev Parnas is at the heart of it. He grew up in the world of Russian [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=244.16s)]
*  organized crime. He got involved in this influence operation to try to smear Joe Biden and his son. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=250.32s)]
*  He decided to come clean after cavorting around Ukraine and doing all sorts of things he felt [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=256.32s)]
*  terribly guilty about. Turns out he documented them all and has all of the receipts on his phone [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=260.4s)]
*  and handed them over to make this film. In any case, thanks to everybody who tuned in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=265.68s)]
*  to watch From Russia with Lev for its premiere. You made it the most watched MSNBC documentary [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  in, I think, four years. More than two million people watched it just that first night for the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=279.44s)]
*  premiere. I'm really proud of this movie. I'm so glad so many of you watched it, and I'm really [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=284.88s)]
*  glad to be cementing that part of the factual record so it doesn't get memory hold like so much [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=290.0s)]
*  else in the Trump experience has. Whether you caught the film or not, you can hear a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=296.96s)]
*  conversation with me and Lev Parnas and his very charming wife Svetlana, plus the director of the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=302.96s)]
*  film Billy Corbin. That is posted right now on my podcast feed. It's for MSNBC premium subscribers [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmDO-_-LVJo&t=308.0s)]
