# What Matters, And What Doesn't, In The DOJ's Trump Papers Probe
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk)
*  Joining us now for his first U.S. television interview is veteran former espionage prosecutor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=0.0s)]
*  and former member of Robert Mueller's team. He worked on the prosecutions of Michael Flynn [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=4.96s)]
*  and Paul Manafort. His name is Brandon Van Graak. Mr. Van Graak, it's a real pleasure to meet you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=8.72s)]
*  Thank you. Nice to meet you as well. First of all, thank you for doing this. I know you don't [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=12.96s)]
*  do this, so I'm very grateful that you've decided to be here. I want to talk to you about a lot of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=17.2s)]
*  things in your career, but I want to start with the national discourse right now around this [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=22.16s)]
*  investigation involving the search warrant at the president's home in South Florida. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=26.32s)]
*  The headlines that say this is an inquiry under the Espionage Act continuing to blow everybody's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=31.68s)]
*  minds. I still find it to be almost impossible to look at those headlines and not see this as a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=38.4s)]
*  movie and see this as real life. But as somebody who's actually worked in the nitty gritty around [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=42.64s)]
*  this part of the law, what should we understand about the seriousness here? And do you feel like [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  any of the national discourse around it is wrong or overblown? So it's a really important point [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=52.96s)]
*  because right now there is a focus on what is the end game? Is there someone going to be charged? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=59.52s)]
*  You don't need to get to that point to appreciate the fact that there is serious national security [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=66.8s)]
*  implications from the conduct and the information just before us. It's just from the receipt of the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=73.36s)]
*  search warrant. There are multiple series of documents that are classified, that are labeled [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=79.76s)]
*  top secret, that were in unsecured locations for 19 months. We already know the fact that there were [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=84.88000000000001s)]
*  classified documents that were provided to the archives seven months before that. You don't need [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=91.76s)]
*  to take any more leaps beyond that to appreciate the fact that there's real national security harm [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  and potential damage caused by that. Right now, the intelligence community is sorting through that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  information and doing a damage assessment, trying to assess what sources and methods have been [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=107.92s)]
*  compromised. That's separate from whether in fact anyone is charged. And so it's important that we [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=112.48s)]
*  don't get too far ahead of what's in front of us. One of the things that's been described by [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=117.6s)]
*  reporters, and I'm not quite sure that I totally understand that. I think I get it in my head, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=122.0s)]
*  but not in my gut, is that the Justice Department's reference to the potential statutes that are [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=126.08s)]
*  implicated here, I keep hearing it described that it doesn't necessarily matter, that the way they [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=131.04s)]
*  are citing statutory law doesn't necessarily matter if Trump believes that he declassified [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=136.56s)]
*  those documents, that the technical classification status of those documents wouldn't necessarily [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=141.52s)]
*  impact whether or not charges could be brought on those statutes. Do you agree with that assessment, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=146.88s)]
*  looking at what we've seen in the search warrant? And can you explain it? Yeah, so I think that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=151.04s)]
*  that might be technically true, but in reality, I think ultimately if in fact this material was [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=154.72s)]
*  declassified, I think it would have a material impact on whether charges are brought. So [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=160.72s)]
*  the charge referenced in the Espionage Act, it concerns the mishandling and retention of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=165.92s)]
*  classified information. It's 18 United States Code 793. And the language in the statute says [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=171.52s)]
*  the retention of national defense information, and that's defined through years of case law. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=177.28s)]
*  It doesn't say classified information, but for all intents and purposes, the Justice Department [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=182.48s)]
*  considers that to be classified information. There's only one case in its history where [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=187.84s)]
*  information that was not classified information was charged, and that was actually a plea agreement. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  So it wasn't sort of tested. And so for all intents and purposes, if the Department of Justice [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  believes or has reason to believe that this information was declassified, and we don't know [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=201.84s)]
*  that, then it is very unlikely that what's called a retention case, that the retention charge [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  would occur. Now, with respect to the other two charges that were mentioned in the search [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=211.76s)]
*  warrant, there was one concerning obstruction and another concerning the removal of ultimately [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=216.72s)]
*  presidential records. That also doesn't have a connection to classified information. So it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=221.12s)]
*  doesn't technically matter. But ultimately, the motive and intent behind the removal of the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  information or the obstruction does matter. And so if people involved in the process did believe [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  they were declassified, that matters. Now, that doesn't mean that therefore it precludes a criminal [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=237.84s)]
*  prosecution on those two statutes. But the point is it's matter and it's relevant. And so I don't [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=242.88s)]
*  think simply saying it's immaterial is the right way to view the charges. If the person in question [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=248.56s)]
*  here, one of the people in question here, is potentially in trouble because of the way these [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=254.96s)]
*  documents were handled, is the former president, is there a way to divine his intent for the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=258.56s)]
*  purpose of deciding whether charges are warranted without interviewing him? So the reality is if [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  he's the target of an investigation, there isn't going to be an interview. I mean, that justâand [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=275.2s)]
*  we do know from the information that you discussed in the top of the hour that there's a discussion [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  in the government's recent filing in terms of the decision not to unseal the affidavit that there [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  are witnesses who are cooperating in the investigation. They specifically say that's a basis [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=292.8s)]
*  for not unsealing the affidavit. So there are certainly people in the orbit that would [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=297.12s)]
*  have information that would be relevant to understanding intent and motive. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=301.68s)]
*  One of the things that arose today in the news was a claim by former President Trump that his [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=306.0s)]
*  passports went walkies during the search warrant, during the execution of the search warrant. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=311.52s)]
*  He described them as being stolen by the FBI. There's later reporting suggesting that these were [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  perhaps that his passports were taken as part of the search execution of the search warrant and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=322.4s)]
*  then returned to him. What should we understand about that? So a couple pieces, which is first, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  there's a lot of noise that happens in these investigations. And it's really important that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=331.52s)]
*  we're not distracted by the cacophony and really focus on the important information. And that goes [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  to my earlier point, which is just based on what we know, there are significant national security [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=341.91999999999996s)]
*  implications behind what happened. With respect to the passport, if that is in fact true, if in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  fact there were multiple passports of the former president taken, there's really not much to read [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=352.4s)]
*  into that. It is unlikely that the Department of Justice is signaling that the former president is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=356.8s)]
*  a flight risk. It is unlikely that the Department of Justice is signaling that criminal charges [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=362.16s)]
*  are eminent. More likely, again, if it is in fact true, it is simply responsive to the search [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=367.04s)]
*  warrant. The search warrant specifically said it can seize presidential records. And so perhaps the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=372.64s)]
*  FBI believed, I don't know rightly or wrongly, that these passports were presidential records. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=377.76s)]
*  There's also in the search warrant, it says information that's co-mingled with the classified [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=382.72s)]
*  information should be seized. And so for all we know, these passports were co-mingled. But [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  talking about something that ultimately I don't think is significant, if for any reason the denial [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=392.8s)]
*  of these passports impaired the president's ability to travel, I'm certain that a simple call from the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=398.24s)]
*  president's lawyers to the Department of Justice would resolve that. So ultimately, I think it's a [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=403.6s)]
*  distraction and it's important because there are some real serious issues here that we don't get [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=407.68s)]
*  distracted by. I think that's one of those things where it's like you see, you know, the government [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=411.52s)]
*  has his passports and you immediately go to like the issue of law and order where the guy gets [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  arrested and his passports are seized because he's seen as a flight risk but there's no nothing here [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=421.76s)]
*  to indicate that connection. And look, there are instances where passports do get seized but [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=425.44s)]
*  that is when someone is about to be charged or has been charged and there's no indication that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  we've reached that point in an investigation. I also wanted to ask you about the news reported [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  in the New York Times this weekend that President Trump through an intermediary appears to have [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=439.59999999999997s)]
*  tried to reach out to the attorney general after this search warrant was executed, obviously, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=444.64s)]
*  and after the attorney general, around the time the attorney general is making his decision [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  to both speak publicly about it and to ask for the search warrant to be unsealed. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=456.32s)]
*  Just from the perspective of somebody who's in the Justice Department at the kind of levels that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=461.68s)]
*  you worked at, is that wrong? Is that weird? Is that appropriate? Is that normal? How do you [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=464.8s)]
*  view that? I guess I view it as irrelevant. The reality is there are probably outreaches that [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=471.2s)]
*  occur to senior levels of the government and Department of Justice all the time. This is [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=477.04s)]
*  something where I cannot see or think of a situation where an outreach like that will have [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  any impact on the investigation. And so appropriate or not, again, I don't think it will have any [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=487.36s)]
*  impact on the investigation. And again, really, I would consider it to be noise or a distraction [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=493.12s)]
*  when the fact is, again, there are real national security issues at play, and that really should [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=497.6s)]
*  be the focus. Well, let me ask you about another thing, which may just be a distraction, but from [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=501.44s)]
*  the outside, it seems at least fraught. We've now seen three Trump White House lawyers, the White [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=505.52s)]
*  House counsel, Pat Cipollone, his deputy, Pat Philbin, and now today we learned Eric Hirschman, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=512.24s)]
*  all White House lawyers working for the president, all having received subpoenas from the Justice [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=516.88s)]
*  Department. We don't exactly know the topic. We don't even know which grand jury. There's a [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=520.88s)]
*  lot of different investigations. That itself is remarkable. We've also seen a member of Congress [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=524.88s)]
*  had his phone seized as part of an investigation in which he's reportedly has been told he's a [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=529.84s)]
*  witness and not a target. When you're talking about White House lawyers and serving members [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=535.2s)]
*  of Congress and these sorts of people who aren't typically caught up in the work of the Justice [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=540.0s)]
*  Department, how does that influence you? Your decisions as a prosecutor, as an investigator, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=544.08s)]
*  knowing that people with a lot of political power and people working in sensitive political jobs are [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=549.76s)]
*  in your sights? Well, I think one of the signals from the Attorney General and the Justice Department, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=553.92s)]
*  which is really important to stress, is that ultimately those considerations really are not [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=559.36s)]
*  having an impact. And that's in multiple investigations. In fact, I think there's [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=564.72s)]
*  also reporting today indicating that the search warrant with respect to Mar-a-Lago was sitting [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=568.48s)]
*  with the Attorney General for a period of time and that he was wrestling with it. And I think [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=573.52s)]
*  what we can say, even though I think it's common for there to be disagreement in some of the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=577.92s)]
*  actions from the Department of Justice, that all of the actions we're talking about are not influenced [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=582.56s)]
*  by political considerations. And there really is no appearance of political influence in these [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=587.04s)]
*  decisions. And I think that is such a critical issue for the Department of Justice. I mean, really, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=591.68s)]
*  if you take a step back and appreciate when you talk about the Department of Justice, it is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7MNJLipTk&t=598.4799999999999s)]
