# Compromised investigations a concern after arrest of FBI counterintelligence official
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8)
*  Joining us now is someone who really does know these things and not just from spy novels. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=0.0s)]
*  Mary McCord served as the top national security official at the U.S. Department of Justice. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=4.88s)]
*  She's now executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  at Georgetown Law School. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=13.56s)]
*  Mary McCord, it's a real pleasure and an honor to have you here tonight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for taking time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=17.56s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=19.52s)]
*  First, let me just ask you if what I just described about the McGonigal case is fair. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=20.52s)]
*  Just looking at this as a lay observer, as somebody who reads the news and can read the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=27.36s)]
*  public-facing documents here, it just seems like this must be an incredibly rare and unusual [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  thing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=37.28s)]
*  I mean, this is a senior FBI official from the counterintelligence side of things charged [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=38.28s)]
*  with being paid by people he was investigating and people with ties to foreign governments [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=42.0s)]
*  and foreign intelligence services. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  This seems like kind of a unicorn case. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, any time that you have a law enforcement official at any level, federal, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=54.12s)]
*  state, local, who abuses the trust placed in them by virtue of their position, you know, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  that's a very bad thing and it's very dangerous for public safety and it really erodes the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=65.32s)]
*  feeling of Americans and the ability to have faith in their law enforcement. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=71.12s)]
*  But this is magnified so many times because this is just an astonishing abuse of that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=76.08s)]
*  trust when you're talking about somebody who's not only betraying his office and putting [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=81.96s)]
*  Americans at risk in terms of public safety here in the U.S., he is actually doing this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=88.88s)]
*  on behalf of foreign adversaries. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=95.72s)]
*  And this is somebody who through his job was cleared, I'm sure, at the very highest levels [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  in terms of our classified information privy to sensitive information about intelligence [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=104.0s)]
*  collection about what adversaries such as Putin and the Russian government, such as in some cases [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  the Chinese government privy to the various tactics and techniques that they've utilized to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=116.36s)]
*  meddle in various U.S. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=123.2s)]
*  affairs. And this is somebody who had access to all of that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=125.36s)]
*  And now to learn that not only did he betray that trust after he left the FBI, but also while [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=128.44s)]
*  he was still in the FBI, it's really staggering. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=134.84s)]
*  And I'm very glad to see that the department and the FBI has come down hard on him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=138.0s)]
*  And I, you know, with indictments in two different jurisdictions for multiple crimes, serious [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  crimes. And you're right, I've not seen this very often. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=150.52s)]
*  So far, there's no Espionage Act charges. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=155.52s)]
*  And I hope there never will be because I hope there'll never be any evidence that he actually [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=158.16s)]
*  provided the information he was privy to to any of our foreign adversaries. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=162.84s)]
*  But this is very, very serious in so many ways. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=167.16s)]
*  Now, I should mention Charles McGonigal did plead not guilty to the charges filed against him in [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=171.44s)]
*  New York. If he is found guilty, if he is convicted based on the just the statutory [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=175.84s)]
*  the sentences associated with the statutes under which he's charged, he's looking at potentially [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=182.6s)]
*  decades in prison. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  And it's serious for all the reasons that you described. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  I do find myself wondering today, though, whether or not he is convicted. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=191.16s)]
*  Is this potentially a problem for any of the counterintelligence prosecutions that he [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=195.72s)]
*  played a role in? For example, just when it comes to Oleg Deripaska, we know that the FBI [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=201.48s)]
*  raided homes associated with Mr. Deripaska last year. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=206.2s)]
*  We know that he's been charged with trying to evade sanctions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=209.32s)]
*  We also now know that Mr. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  McGonigal, who was involved in in the Deripaska investigation in cases related to him, as [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=214.48s)]
*  well as other oligarchs, it has been allegedly compromised in in multiple ways. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=219.6s)]
*  Does that potentially blow up some of the cases or all of the cases that he was involved [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=224.92s)]
*  in during his time in the FBI? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=230.12s)]
*  Well, I'd add to that that the D.C. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  indictment also alleges that he was being paid by someone who later was actually a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=235.32s)]
*  cooperating witness, a witness for in an investigation he was engaged in. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=243.04s)]
*  So it gets the plot even thickens. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=247.28s)]
*  But you're right, the Department of Justice will be now doing an analysis of cases that Mr. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=249.92s)]
*  McGonigal had a hand in either as a supervisor or as an investigator and will be looking [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  carefully to see if there is any compromise or any Brady information that would be [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=262.44s)]
*  information that the government is obligated to provide to defendants who've been charged with [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=268.64s)]
*  crimes where he may have had a hand. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=273.48s)]
*  They'll be looking to see if there's anything they need to disclose, whether they need to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=276.68s)]
*  dismiss cases and, of course, you know, whether even in past cases there's anything they might [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=280.44s)]
*  need to disclose. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=285.84s)]
*  Now, I will say this encounter intelligence, unlike so many other areas of what of the FBI's [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=286.84s)]
*  work, much of that work does not actually result in criminal cases. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=293.32s)]
*  The counterintelligence agents that I worked with, they would have been the first people to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=298.12s)]
*  say to you, we don't we don't really want any of our cases to end in charges. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=302.4s)]
*  We want to keep acquiring the intelligence that we need to try to keep the U.S. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=306.0s)]
*  safe from national security threats from our adversaries. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=311.2s)]
*  And so it's not the area where you see many, many, many charges. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  You don't even see nearly as many as you see with respect to counterterrorism and terrorism [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=319.44s)]
*  cases. And certainly nothing like what you see in other sort of run of the mill criminal cases, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=325.28s)]
*  even conspiracies, even white collar conspiracy and some drug conspiracies. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=330.96s)]
*  Those are areas of the FBI that are much more focused on investigating a crime for a charging [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=334.76s)]
*  decision. Counterintelligence is about long term investigations, understanding the tools and [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=340.44s)]
*  tactic techniques of our adversaries so that we can better counter those threats. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=346.12s)]
*  Which has sort of it's a good news, bad news thing in terms of potentially blowing up any charge, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=351.68s)]
*  any any any cases that actually were charged and made it their way to court, but also has [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=357.08s)]
*  potentially long term and international consequences in terms of, as you say, in terms of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=361.76s)]
*  national security. Mary McCord, who served as acting assistant attorney general for national [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=366.08s)]
*  security at the Department of Justice now at Georgetown Law School. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=371.12s)]
*  Miss McCord, thank you very much for your time and your expertise tonight. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  It's really invaluable to have you here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=376.56s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWaRnKNZA8&t=378.68s)]
