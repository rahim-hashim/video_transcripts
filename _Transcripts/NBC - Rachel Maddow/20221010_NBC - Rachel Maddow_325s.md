# Calamitous GOP Candidates Keep Control Of Senate Within Democratic Reach Through Midterms
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ)
*  So we are less than 30 days out now from the elections. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  We're going to be joined in just a moment here by the man who is in charge of the Democratic [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=4.16s)]
*  Party's efforts to hold the United States Senate. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=8.72s)]
*  And that is quite a job this year. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  The polling averages right now show that the prospects for both parties in the Senate [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  are equal as of today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Literally, if what the polling says today ends up matching the vote on election day, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=22.64s)]
*  it will be 50-50 in the Senate. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=28.0s)]
*  So in terms of control of the Senate, control of the direction of the country, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=31.04s)]
*  every race really matters. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=35.76s)]
*  Every seat really matters. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=37.84s)]
*  Every candidate really matters. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=39.36s)]
*  It is just on a knife's edge. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=40.96s)]
*  And I mean, just at a personal level, if you didn't know whether you're going to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  volunteer for a candidate yet this year, or if you were going to volunteer to door knocker [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=48.56s)]
*  or do some get out the vote work, if you hadn't yet committed to just voting [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=52.72s)]
*  yourself this year, this year your vote really will matter. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=57.68s)]
*  This is not one to skip out on. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=62.24s)]
*  This election is going to be very tight and very, very interesting and very consequential. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=64.56s)]
*  Again, if the polling bears out and election day looks anything like the polls say it's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=70.4s)]
*  going to look today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=74.88s)]
*  Again, we'll be talking with the man in charge of the Democratic Party's efforts in the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=76.72s)]
*  Senate in just a moment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=80.24s)]
*  Obviously, a super high stakes job, super difficult job. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=81.28s)]
*  Still though, who would you rather be? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=87.04s)]
*  Would you rather be the Senate guy for the Democrats right now? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=88.72000000000001s)]
*  Or would you rather be the Senate guy for the Republicans? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Who tomorrow has to go to the state of Georgia and say, yeah, hey, everybody vote for Herschel [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  Walker. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=101.04s)]
*  Because when you look at Herschel Walker, take it from me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  We want you to know that's what Republicans stand for. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  And no, we will not be taking questions about the holding a gun to a woman's head thing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=108.64000000000001s)]
*  Nor will we be taking questions about these secret children no one was allowed to know [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=113.2s)]
*  about while he's running on his supposed family values. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=116.88s)]
*  Nor will we be taking any questions about any of the abortions, even though he wants [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  all abortions banned. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Nope, we will not be taking questions about the times he said he used to run six hospitals [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  and that he graduated from college in the top 1% of his class when he actually did not [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=131.28s)]
*  graduate from college at all. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=135.6s)]
*  Nor will we be taking questions about his fantasies that he runs the country's largest [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=137.12s)]
*  upholstery business and also gigantic chicken businesses, which in fact he does not run. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=142.32s)]
*  Nor will we be taking questions about the times he said he was a law enforcement officer [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=148.48s)]
*  or the time he claimed to be an FBI agent. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=152.64s)]
*  No, he is not an FBI agent. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=155.84s)]
*  He is not a police officer, even though he has said he was both. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  We will not be answering questions about those matters today, but do please vote for the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=160.4s)]
*  man anyway. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=163.92s)]
*  Because Republican Party values. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=165.44s)]
*  I'm here to attest. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=167.28s)]
*  I mean, your job may suck. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=168.8s)]
*  I hope it doesn't. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  I hope you have a great job. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  But even if your job sucks, you're still not Rick Scott. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  Imagine that was your job. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=179.84s)]
*  Republican Senator Rick Scott is running the Senate campaigns this year for the Republicans. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=182.08s)]
*  Tomorrow, he really is going to have to go do that in Georgia to try to save that Georgia [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=186.8s)]
*  Senate race for the Republican Party, where their candidate, unfortunately for them, is [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=191.12s)]
*  Herschel Walker. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=195.52s)]
*  And then there's, you know, the Republican candidate for Senate in Arizona who says his [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  vote for the most underrated thinker is the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  And this is not a circumstance in which the candidate was given a test where it was multiple [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  choice. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  The only possible answers were like, you know, Satan, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, Stalin or the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=212.4s)]
*  Unabomber. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=218.4s)]
*  It's not like he hadn't like to choose the best among bad. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=219.04s)]
*  It was just an open question. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=222.64s)]
*  Who do you like? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=223.92s)]
*  And he just volunteered that the one he likes is the Unabomber. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=224.72s)]
*  Subversive thinker that's underrated? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=230.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=233.6s)]
*  I'll probably get in trouble for saying this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=235.44s)]
*  No, I mean, I'd say how about like Theodore Kaczynski? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=238.48s)]
*  Good. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=243.52s)]
*  Good one. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=243.92s)]
*  Actually, yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=244.96s)]
*  Probably not great to be talking about the Unabomber while campaigning. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=247.68s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=253.12s)]
*  That wasn't like a youthful indiscretion. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=254.48s)]
*  That was this year while he's running. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=256.16s)]
*  And now he's the Republican nominee for Senate in the great state of Arizona, everyone. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=259.12s)]
*  If you didn't like that the Unabomber wasn't able to get more of what he wanted, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=263.52s)]
*  just elect Blake Masters and see. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=267.76s)]
*  I mean, so it's tempting when you've got, you know, Herschel Walker in Georgia, when [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=271.44s)]
*  you've got that guy in Arizona, when you've got this snake oil quack supplement [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=277.36s)]
*  salesman, green coffee beans as your Republican candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=283.52s)]
*  It is tempting to look at that sort of slate for this year and think something's gone wrong [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=288.16s)]
*  in a uniquely bad way this year. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=292.8s)]
*  It's never been this bad. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=294.48s)]
*  No political party has ever had to face candidate problems this bad. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=295.68s)]
*  But as bad as it is right now, it has been worse. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=300.4s)]
*  I swear. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=303.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZziJp_KWQ&t=313.44s)]
