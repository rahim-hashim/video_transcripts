# First Salvo Of Sanctions Batter Russia
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0)
*  Today, the U.S., the U.K., and all 27 EU member nations unanimously imposed sweeping restrictions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=0.0s)]
*  against Russia, or, to use President Biden's words, carving out a big chunk of Ukraine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=7.74s)]
*  The details of the sanctions differ between the three groups, but the broad strokes are [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=13.6s)]
*  the same. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=17.26s)]
*  All of them sanction Russian banks, elite Russian individuals, and cut off Russia from [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=18.34s)]
*  Western financing. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=23.18s)]
*  The U.S., for example, is fully sanctioning two of Russia's biggest banks, VEB, which [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=24.7s)]
*  is one of Russia's biggest investment banks, and Russia's military bank, PSB, both of which [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=29.9s)]
*  are crucial to financing Russia's defense industry. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=36.04s)]
*  The military bank alone handles 70 percent of Russia's defense contracts, and it's the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=38.9s)]
*  smaller of the two banks. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=43.94s)]
*  The U.S. is also sanctioning a handful of elite Russian individuals and cutting off U.S. financing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  of Russian sovereign debt. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=50.94s)]
*  In addition to the sanctions that are being imposed by the U.K. and the EU, Germany delivered [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=52.699999999999996s)]
*  what might be the biggest economic blow against Russia today by halting Russia's Nord Stream [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=58.54s)]
*  2 pipeline. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=63.94s)]
*  You see two pipelines there through the Baltic Sea. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=64.94s)]
*  The one in the red is Nord Stream 1. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  The one in blue is Nord Stream 2. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=69.97999999999999s)]
*  Nord Stream 2 is not on yet. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=71.94s)]
*  It's not online. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=73.42s)]
*  It's been built. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=74.42s)]
*  We've been unsure about whether Germany, which is in the midst of a domestic energy crisis, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=75.42s)]
*  would reject the potential flow of double the amount of natural gas from Russia. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=79.78s)]
*  But today, Germany did just that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=84.54s)]
*  The West presented a united front. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=88.06s)]
*  All groups involved were also very clear this is just the first round of sanctions, and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=90.18s)]
*  that significantly worse punishments are ready if Russia continues to advance. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=94.38s)]
*  But what exactly would those harsher sanctions be? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=98.66s)]
*  Would they target Putin personally? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=102.26s)]
*  How quickly could they get Russia under the negotiating table given that sanctions typically [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=104.82s)]
*  have more of a long-term impact? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=108.54s)]
*  And what type of economic impact could all of this have on us here in the United States? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=110.98s)]
*  Joining me is someone who knows a great deal about sanctions, Hagar Shamali is a senior [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=117.62s)]
*  policy advisor in the Treasury Sanctions Division during the Obama administration. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=121.06s)]
*  She was a Treasury spokesperson back when the United States imposed sanctions on Russia [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=125.06s)]
*  in 2014 for its annexation of Crimea. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=129.62s)]
*  She's also the host of Oh My World on YouTube. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=132.34s)]
*  Hagar, thanks again for being with us. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=134.66s)]
*  You and I have talked, I think, every single day for the last few days. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=136.34s)]
*  Let me ask you about the seriousness of these sanctions. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  Why I say this is because I think back to when you were involved with Iran. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=143.38s)]
*  And for years, Iran had been dawdling with everybody and not really getting down to business. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=147.7s)]
*  And then the U.S. Treasury imposed certain types of sanctions that were so effective [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=151.94s)]
*  that it got to the table and it ended up resulting ultimately in the Iran nuclear deal. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=157.1s)]
*  What's that magic bullet for Russia? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=161.62s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned Iran because I was thinking about it during your introduction. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=164.98s)]
*  And people always say that sanctions don't work until they do. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=168.73999999999998s)]
*  Right. And Iran is a perfect example of that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=172.1s)]
*  Those sanctions, the ones that really crippled Iran's economy, that brought them to the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=174.42s)]
*  negotiating table were sanctions related to its oil sector. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=178.1s)]
*  Right. The ones that prevented other countries from purchasing the oil and from Iran from [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=181.14s)]
*  benefiting from those proceeds. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=186.98s)]
*  Right. And that's also for Russia. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=188.42s)]
*  The oil and gas sector is a major hit. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=191.06s)]
*  You mentioned it in your introduction. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=192.98s)]
*  The sanctions related to Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Germany did and we needed Germany to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=194.5s)]
*  do that and to lead on that, that robs Russia of billions, billions with a B, billions of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=200.02s)]
*  dollars. And that money will go to fuel its violence machine, right, and to prop up Putin's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=206.1s)]
*  regime. So those are going to be strong. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=211.54s)]
*  And the sanctions that you saw from the Biden administration, the bottom line is that all of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=213.86s)]
*  those sanctions are very tough. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=218.1s)]
*  They will inflict financial pain on Russia, but they may not be enough to walk him back from [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=219.62s)]
*  what he's just done. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=225.3s)]
*  So what is that? How does one find the may not be enough? What's the thing in Iran? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  You talked about the oil sanctions. There was the removal of Iran from the swift system. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=231.78s)]
*  So the people just couldn't do any trade with anyone. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=236.1s)]
*  You couldn't sell carpets. You couldn't sell anything to anyone that required a different [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=238.34s)]
*  currency or an international bank. What's the equivalent for Russia that would really hurt? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=242.1s)]
*  I assume it's oil and gas stuff because it's the biggest thing they sell. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=247.7s)]
*  Oil and gas would be huge, but it also gives them that's also a point of leverage for them. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  Right. So because Russia so integrated into the international financial system, they do make them [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=256.34s)]
*  a target that is easy to hit with sanctions. But at the same time, they could retaliate and there [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=262.5s)]
*  will be backlash on U.S. and European business and also global markets. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=267.62s)]
*  Right. So if they rob the Europeans of the gas that they export to Europe, which [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=271.86s)]
*  currently Europe imports 40 percent of its gas and oil from Russia, then that would cause a price [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=277.3s)]
*  skyrocketing all over the place. Right. Because Europe would have to find a new source, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=283.94s)]
*  would have to fix its refinery production abilities. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=288.1s)]
*  And it would be here too. It would affect our prices here because oil and gas go up globally. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=290.98s)]
*  Yes, it would absolutely affect us here. Now, that said, that doesn't mean that there aren't [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=296.26s)]
*  a number of other options that the White House and the Treasury Department state could pursue [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=300.5s)]
*  to further tighten the financial noose around Russia. You have, for example, more Russian [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=305.3s)]
*  financial institutions. We haven't yet seen any export controls placed on the export and sale of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  U.S. technology to Russia that supports its oil and gas sector, its efforts to diversify its economy, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  its efforts to develop technology and its mobile sector and so on. Right. That would hit them hard. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=322.42s)]
*  Of course, you have Russian oligarchs. Europe for years has allowed those Russian oligarchs to park [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  their assets there to invest in real estate and set up their businesses there. So there's a lot [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=333.86s)]
*  of opportunity there. What the EU did today was also impressive given that EU sanctions require [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=339.06s)]
*  the consensus of all members. And that includes Hungary and Hungary's close to Russia. Right. So [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  that's a strong message. But you still have major moves like cutting off Swift relationship. You [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=349.7s)]
*  have things like sanctioning President Putin himself. Things like that are never off the table. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=357.94s)]
*  Right. So you can ramp it up. And the one thing I would I would end here with is that Secretary [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=361.7s)]
*  Janet Yellen said in the press release something I thought that was very key. She said that this was [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=367.7s)]
*  the beginning of dismantling the Kremlin's financial network, meaning they have a lot left in the hopper [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=372.58s)]
*  and they want at least President Putin to stop in his tracks. And then, you know, and then there are [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=380.02s)]
*  hopefully make him walk backwards with a strategy, you know, another strategy, a broader strategy [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=385.54s)]
*  in place as well. All right. Well, look, every day these new things come out and people like us don't [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=392.34000000000003s)]
*  know exactly what to make of them. But that's when we call you and we say, is this is this a big one? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=397.3s)]
*  Is this serious? So we'll be doing that over the course of the next few days with you. Thanks, my [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=401.06s)]
*  friend. Hagar Shamali is a former senior policy adviser in the Treasury sanctions division. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=404.5s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSS65VbBs0&t=408.74s)]
