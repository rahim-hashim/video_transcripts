# DOJ's 'Task Force KleptoCapture' Seizes Russian's Yacht In New Push
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU)
*  This 255-foot luxury yacht's name is Tango. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=0.0s)]
*  It's currently docked on the Spanish island of Mallorca. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=4.8s)]
*  It's estimated to cost a whopping $90 million. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  It's staffed by a crew of 22 people and equipped with cabins for 14 guests, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=10.6s)]
*  a swimming pool, and a beauty salon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Tango belongs to the Russian oligarch Victor Vexelberg. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=17.8s)]
*  He's a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=21.8s)]
*  Or we actually should say Tango did belong to Victor Vexelberg until early this morning [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=24.2s)]
*  when it was seized by the FBI and Spanish authorities. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=29.6s)]
*  Prosecutors in Spain obtained a court order allowing U.S. authorities [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  to swoop in and take control of the ship. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=36.6s)]
*  Now, this is not the first seizure of an oligarch's yacht. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=39.0s)]
*  Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=41.800000000000004s)]
*  a whole barrage of mega yachts have been seized in exclusive marinas all across Europe. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=43.6s)]
*  But this yacht's seizure is notable because it's the first by U.S. officials. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=49.0s)]
*  Today's operation was coordinated by the Justice Department's new KleptoCapture Task Force, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=55.199999999999996s)]
*  which is an interagency law enforcement group [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  aimed at holding sanctioned Russians accountable. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=63.8s)]
*  And today, the Attorney General, Merrick Garland, made it clear this is just the beginning. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=66.8s)]
*  Today marks our task force's first seizure of an asset belonging to a sanctioned individual [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=72.8s)]
*  with close ties to the Russian regime. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=78.8s)]
*  It will not be the last. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=82.0s)]
*  Together with our international partners, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=84.6s)]
*  we will do everything possible to hold accountable any individual [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=86.8s)]
*  whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue its unjust war. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  While President Biden himself has admitted these measures will not change the tide of this war, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=99.0s)]
*  they certainly chip away at the pillars of Vladimir Putin's support. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOaCv-S5ubU&t=103.39999999999999s)]
