# Donald Trump fired the man who likely saved his life: Former medical official
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04)
*  Last week, President Trump attended a Women's History Month event. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=0.0s)]
*  I know you thought that wasn't allowed anymore. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=4.16s)]
*  But there was Donald Trump hosting a Women's History event at the White House. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=7.8s)]
*  At this event, he displayed his well-known knack for speaking about women in a totally [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=11.4s)]
*  normal and non-creepy way. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=15.3s)]
*  He said, quote, we're going to have tremendous, tremendous goodies in the bag for women, too. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=17.28s)]
*  The women between the fertilization and all of the other things that we're talking about. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=24.28s)]
*  It's going to be, it's going to be great. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=29.4s)]
*  Fertilization. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=31.68s)]
*  I'm still very proud of it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=32.68s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=34.4s)]
*  I'll be known as the Fertilization President, and that's okay. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=35.4s)]
*  That's not bad. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=39.04s)]
*  That's not bad. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=40.04s)]
*  I've been called much worse. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=41.04s)]
*  Actually, I like it, right? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=42.04s)]
*  I like it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=43.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=44.04s)]
*  I'll be known as the Fertilization President. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=47.56s)]
*  We think he's referring to IVF treatments, which he promised as a candidate would be free if he got elected [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=55.72s)]
*  after other Republicans were supporting banning IVF. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=61.72s)]
*  Anyway, well, how's that going? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=65.72s)]
*  Headline, CDC's IVF team gutted, even as Trump calls himself the Fertilization President. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=67.72s)]
*  Quote, a team that tracked how well in vitro fertilization worked across the U.S. was abruptly [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=72.72s)]
*  cut Tuesday as part of the sweeping layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=77.72s)]
*  One team member telling NBC News, quote, it's surprising to me President Trump said he was the Fertility President. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=81.72s)]
*  How does cutting this program support that? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=86.72s)]
*  The Trump administration has given out zero information on the 10,000 people it fired yesterday from federal health organizations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=91.72s)]
*  And so we're only now starting to piece together the scale of the carnage as these 10,000 fired government workers start to speak up [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=100.72s)]
*  and talk to the press or post to social media about what has happened inside their agencies and what jobs they were fired from. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=109.72s)]
*  I mean, this is just a sampling. At the FDA, quote, offices focused on food, drug and medical device policy were hit with deep staff reductions. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=116.72s)]
*  At the CDC, fired employees included those studying injuries, asthma, lead poisoning, smoking and radiation damage, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=125.72s)]
*  as well as those that assessed the health effects of extreme heat and wildfires. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=132.72s)]
*  HIV prevention was a big target, including teams leading HIV surveillance and research and a group of health researchers who were working on preventing transmission of HIV from mother to child. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=137.72s)]
*  The AP says, quote, scores of government employees who help administer the early childhood program Head Start have been put on leave. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=148.72s)]
*  Preschool operators say they have received no communication from the Office of Head Start and don't know who to turn to. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=155.72s)]
*  NBC News reports that several divisions at HHS focused on the safety of people who work in mining. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=161.72s)]
*  Those divisions were cut entirely. The whole office that administers LIHEAP, the low income home energy assistance program, that whole office is gone. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=168.72s)]
*  That's a program that literally keeps the heat on in millions of American homes through the winter. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=178.72s)]
*  They just zeroed it out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=183.72s)]
*  From NPR, quote, HHS layoffs hit meals on wheels and other services for seniors and disabled people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=186.72s)]
*  At least 40 percent of staff in those areas fired. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=192.72s)]
*  Wired magazine reports that the CDC's vessel sanitation program has been eliminated. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=196.72s)]
*  It, quote, helps the cruise industry prevent public health issues, inspects cruises and provides information on outbreaks. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=202.72s)]
*  Definitely get rid of that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=209.72s)]
*  Also gone, the branch of our government that works to eliminate childhood lead poisoning. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=212.72s)]
*  Like I said, we are piecing this together from what we can discern from the firings, oftentimes from what we hear from the people themselves who have been fired. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=219.72s)]
*  What we are piecing together appears to be a portrait of pretty total destruction of the most advanced scientific and health institutions in the entire world. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=227.72s)]
*  Dr. David Kessler has led prestigious medical schools. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=236.72s)]
*  He is known and beloved for his landmark work on HIV and AIDS for taking on the tobacco industry. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=239.72s)]
*  He was the longtime commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration during Covid here on this show. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=245.72s)]
*  In particular, you may remember he became a familiar, even reassuring voice during a very deeply scary time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=250.72s)]
*  Now, with what appears to be the wholesale gutting of the country's health infrastructure currently underway and as yet poorly understood, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=258.72s)]
*  there's only one person I really wanted to talk to. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=265.72s)]
*  Joining us now is Dr. David Kessler, former FDA commissioner, former chief science officer for the Biden administration's Covid-19 response. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=268.72s)]
*  Dr. Kessler, it's really nice to have you here. Thank you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=275.72s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=278.72s)]
*  What's your reaction to what we know thus far of these cuts? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=279.72s)]
*  I think they're endangering the lives of all Americans. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=282.72s)]
*  You alluded to it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=286.72s)]
*  Those nights during Covid that you had me on, there were some dark nights, deaths, what, three, four thousands. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=289.72s)]
*  You even mentioned one of those nights you were on the ledge. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=299.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=305.72s)]
*  Right. My job, I was able to walk you back a little. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=306.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=310.72s)]
*  I was able to say, we were able to say, it's going to be OK. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=311.72s)]
*  The reason I was able to do that, because we had people like Peter Marks, Julie Turney. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=315.72s)]
*  We had people who had expertise that allowed us to get through this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=323.72s)]
*  The right drugs, the right vaccines, the right doses. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=332.72s)]
*  They were fired. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=335.72s)]
*  We are less safe today because of these cuts that have happened the last several days. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=337.72s)]
*  I always thought that things were fixable. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=345.72s)]
*  Right? You could fix things. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=348.72s)]
*  I am very concerned that if these cuts are not rescinded, these will have effect for decades. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=351.72s)]
*  You think that the way they have done these cuts, the people they've cut, the number of jobs they've cut, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=360.72s)]
*  potentially have created a crisis in which we can't ever have these institutions back at strength. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=365.72s)]
*  I think we're very close to that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=371.72s)]
*  I wonder whether the president really even knows the extent of what has been done. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=373.72s)]
*  Remember that night that he was taken by helicopter to Walter Reed? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=382.72s)]
*  He was having difficulty breathing. He had COVID. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=388.72s)]
*  He was very sick. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=391.72s)]
*  He was given two monoclonal antibodies. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=393.72s)]
*  He referenced those as miracles. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=397.72s)]
*  They were cures. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=401.72s)]
*  All of a sudden, he got better. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=403.72s)]
*  He could have died, but for those drugs. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=405.72s)]
*  Dr. Peter Stein's office approved, made available those drugs to the president and to thousands of others. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=410.72s)]
*  Peter Stein was fired, was let go. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=420.72s)]
*  I don't think the president knows that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=426.72s)]
*  Someone needs to walk into the Oval Office and say, Mr. President, we just fired the person who may have saved your life. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=428.72s)]
*  From what you know of, part of the difficulty of covering this story is that it is hard to understand the scale of what's happened [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=437.72s)]
*  and to contextualize it to understand, A, because nothing like this has ever happened before, but also because there's been no announcement of what they have done [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=446.72s)]
*  other than this sort of problem from the HHS secretary, forgive me, where he's talking about the revolution has begun and all of this other nonspecific stuff. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=452.72s)]
*  From what you know of who has been fired and what offices have been dismantled, does it say anything to you about there being a strategy at work? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=462.72s)]
*  Is this the wish list of some right-wing group that's always wanted to destroy U.S. health infrastructure? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=473.72s)]
*  I mean, is there any pattern here that you can discern to what they've done? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=478.72s)]
*  It is devastating, but it is haphazard. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=482.72s)]
*  It is thoughtless and it is chaotic. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=486.72s)]
*  I don't think they fully understand what they are done. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=490.72s)]
*  Look, bad stuff is going to happen on their watch that they're going to have to deal with. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=495.72s)]
*  And they're not going to be equipped to do that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=501.72s)]
*  That's what's going to happen. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=505.72s)]
*  We have to be careful, though. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=508.72s)]
*  This is not just about FDA or NIH or CDC. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=510.72s)]
*  You see what's going on in the universities. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=516.72s)]
*  We have to be very careful. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=520.72s)]
*  I mean, the thing that has made America great, that it's made America competitive, there's a lot of things. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=522.72s)]
*  But the biomedical infrastructure, the advances, the reason we are able to live long and productive lives are because of the investment, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=528.72s)]
*  not because we're smarter today, but because of the investment we made 50, 75 years ago, and that's being destroyed. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=540.72s)]
*  It's across the board. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=548.72s)]
*  We have to rescind these cuts. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=550.72s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=553.72s)]
*  When you think about the kinds of things that are going to come over the transom to America's health officials now, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=556.72s)]
*  the kinds of things that they're going to need to respond to that you say they will not have the people in place to respond to adequately, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=565.72s)]
*  categorically, what kind of things are those? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=571.72s)]
*  What are the things they're not foreseeing that they're going to need these people they've just fired? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=574.72s)]
*  Probably the two most knowledgeable people about bird flu, gone. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=578.72s)]
*  People who look at the toxins that are in our food, those programs are gutted. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=584.72s)]
*  The people who are going to just answer the phones to make sure that the next emergency use of that drug like the president got, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=592.72s)]
*  they're not there to answer those calls anymore to make that available to the average citizen. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=602.72s)]
*  The president has to be informed of what the extent of these cuts are. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=609.72s)]
*  And we have maybe a week before this becomes beyond fixable. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=614.72s)]
*  David Kessler, former commissioner of the FDA, chief science officer for the Biden administration's COVID-19 response and friend to this show in many ways. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=624.72s)]
*  Sir, thank you. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=633.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=634.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im9vHZwsZ04&t=639.72s)]
