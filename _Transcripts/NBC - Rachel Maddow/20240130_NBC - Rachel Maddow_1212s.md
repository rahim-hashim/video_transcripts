# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 29
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng)
*  It is a civil case between two very identifiable, very unique individuals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=0.0s)]
*  And as such, there are two ways this has resonated so much with all of us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=8.58s)]
*  There's two reasons why we care so much about what she has just been able to do. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=13.14s)]
*  The first reason, the first reason it resonates, the first reason we care, honestly, is because [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=20.14s)]
*  of us as a country and who we are and the way he as a political figure is trying to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=25.34s)]
*  change us as a country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=31.82s)]
*  You are promising America tonight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=35.82s)]
*  You would never abuse power as retribution against anybody. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=37.94s)]
*  Except for day one. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=42.74s)]
*  Except what? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=43.74s)]
*  He's going crazy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=44.74s)]
*  Except for day one. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=45.74s)]
*  Meaning? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=46.74s)]
*  I said I want to be a dictator for one day. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=47.74s)]
*  Sean, I only want to be a dictator for one day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=49.54s)]
*  Would you rather have four years of Donald Trump as a dictator or four years of Joe Biden [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=54.74s)]
*  as a president? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=60.300000000000004s)]
*  As a dictator? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=62.300000000000004s)]
*  Sometimes in life, we all need a good paddling from the principle to set our life on the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=63.300000000000004s)]
*  right track. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=70.68s)]
*  And this country does need a little bit of that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  We need a little paddling. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  It's nice to have a strong man running your country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  Would you rather have four years of Donald Trump as a dictator or four years of Joe Biden [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=78.54s)]
*  as a president? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=83.46000000000001s)]
*  I'd rather have Donald Trump all the way. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=84.5s)]
*  Even as a dictator? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  Trump as a dictator. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  I think I'm choosing Donald Trump as a dictator. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  I'm going dictator Trump for sure. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=92.05999999999999s)]
*  I'd rather have Donald Trump as a dictator. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=93.78s)]
*  The other day Donald Trump said on his first day he's going to be a dictator for a day. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=95.13999999999999s)]
*  I like that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  Would you rather have Donald Trump as a dictator for four years or reelect Joe Biden for four [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=100.69999999999999s)]
*  years? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=104.5s)]
*  I would rather have Donald Trump. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=105.5s)]
*  I'd like them to see the repeal of the Roosevelt law so that he can be a president for a lot [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=108.02s)]
*  more than four years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=112.46s)]
*  We, this country, needs a dictator. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=114.38s)]
*  I hate to say that, but it's the truth. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=116.22s)]
*  This is part of why we care, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=120.3s)]
*  Because putting him in court tests this whole idea. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=123.98s)]
*  What is appealing about a dictator? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=127.86s)]
*  What is a dictatorship, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=129.82s)]
*  What is appealing about a strong man leader replacing democracy? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=131.3s)]
*  Having somebody who just stays in power indefinitely and has unchecked total authority to do whatever [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=136.06s)]
*  he wants. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=140.74s)]
*  What is appealing about that? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=142.42s)]
*  Not just why would you offer to be that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=145.5s)]
*  You can see the appeal to a person who wants to be that kind of person, but why would you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  want that in your country? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=150.61999999999998s)]
*  The most appealing thing about a strong man leader, right, is that he'd be able to get [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  stuff done. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=157.98s)]
*  He'd be unconstrained, couldn't be stopped. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=158.98s)]
*  I alone can fix it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  Through enforcing loyalty to him or death, by locking up his enemies, by breaking all [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=165.42s)]
*  the rules, you know, government shmoverment, Congress shmongress, the courts, yeah, yeah, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=171.38s)]
*  right, them in what army? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=176.57999999999998s)]
*  That's what he is promising. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=178.66s)]
*  That's the appeal. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=180.06s)]
*  And so what this writer, this journalist, this extraordinary unique woman did was give [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=181.38s)]
*  us pretty much the first test of that prospect that has come all the way to fruition. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=186.66s)]
*  This has run to the end now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=193.18s)]
*  This is the test. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=195.74s)]
*  Is he the strong man that he claims to be and that his followers believe him to be and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=196.74s)]
*  that they so want, instead of this messy democracy where sometimes other people get their way, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=201.78s)]
*  is he that? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=206.58s)]
*  Or is he a citizen, an American who lives in a democracy which has courts and laws? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  A would-be strong man says he is immune from the legal system. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=215.3s)]
*  He is unconstrained by any institution and by anything in our government. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=219.38s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll is the one who called that question. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=225.18s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll's civil case says, I'm not a strong man and neither are you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=228.18s)]
*  None of us are. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=236.74s)]
*  No one can be in America because this is a democracy and the law and a case like this, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=238.02s)]
*  she says, the law protects me, even from you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  And so I will call the question. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=250.1s)]
*  I will call on the law, the court system, to show that, to prove that the strong man [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=251.74s)]
*  model does not work here however much people might want it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=257.14s)]
*  This is not Europe between the wars. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=261.94s)]
*  This is America. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=264.0s)]
*  And that's the second reason that we care, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=268.82s)]
*  That's the second reason this case, this huge $83 million judgment resonates so much with [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=271.9s)]
*  us. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=276.22s)]
*  Because she did this in a civil case, human to human, eyeball to eyeball, she did this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=278.06s)]
*  in her own name and in her own personal defense. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=282.62s)]
*  She called upon the law to protect her, a named person who was willing to put her name [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=286.96s)]
*  to the allegations and to show up in court and say it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=292.46s)]
*  So much of the calculus in our country right now, so much of the calculus, frankly, in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=297.38s)]
*  the world right now, so much of the calculus about how to contend with Trump is, oh, how [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=301.22s)]
*  mad is he going to be? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=306.12s)]
*  How crazy will his supporters go? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=307.78s)]
*  In historian Tim Snyder's seminal book on tyranny, this anticipation of the backlash, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=312.02s)]
*  this worry about how upset Trump and his supporters might get, this is a phenomenon that Snyder [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=318.38s)]
*  describes as obeying in advance, as in do not obey in advance. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=325.26s)]
*  Do not give the tyrant or the would-be tyrant what they want because you fear what they [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=330.35999999999996s)]
*  might do otherwise. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=335.16s)]
*  Put more bluntly, the message is, to Snyder's lights, the lesson from the 20th century is, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=338.76s)]
*  stand up, say no, have guts. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=346.32s)]
*  Be the one. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=350.16s)]
*  How many of us would have the guts of E. Jean Carroll at age 80 to do what she did? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=351.82s)]
*  To call his question, to test it, to make us decide it as a country, to render this [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  would-be strongman just a man. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=364.78s)]
*  Joining us now is E. Jean Carroll, who successfully sued Donald Trump for defamation. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=368.41999999999996s)]
*  She's flanked tonight by her lawyers in the case, Robbie Kaplan, who you see on your left, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=372.53999999999996s)]
*  and Sean Crowley, who you see on the right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you all so much for being here. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  It's such a pleasure to see the three of you here and to have you here. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=380.7s)]
*  I'm really grateful you made the time. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=383.82s)]
*  It's a pleasure. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=385.82s)]
*  Jean, let me just ask you, you guys have lived this case in one way or another since 2019, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=388.17999999999995s)]
*  when Trump was still in the White House and you published your book. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=394.38s)]
*  How different is it now to be part of this case now that you are out the other side? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=397.21999999999997s)]
*  You have won this massive $83 million judgment. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  Does it feel different to you now than it did while you were in the middle of it? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=407.34s)]
*  Rachel, thank you for that incredible introduction. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=410.98s)]
*  The three of us were shaking with laughter and tears in our eyes, laughing and crying [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=416.1s)]
*  all at the same time. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=421.62s)]
*  You happened to put in a nutshell what we were fighting for. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=423.06s)]
*  You did it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=427.3s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=428.3s)]
*  Yes, I feel that this bodes well for the future. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=429.74s)]
*  I think we've planted our flag. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=435.26s)]
*  I think we've made a statement that things are going to be different, that there's going [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=438.18s)]
*  doing things in this country because of this indestructible team of lawyers, Rachel. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=450.46s)]
*  I am sometimes 50 years older than some of the associates on our team. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=461.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm 40 years older than Sean. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=467.17999999999995s)]
*  I'm 30 years older than Robbie. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  Together, this team of brilliant young people have, as you said, stood up to the man who, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=473.18s)]
*  by the way, Rachel, is not even there. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=486.06s)]
*  He's nothing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=489.5s)]
*  He is like a walrus snorting and like a rhino flopping his hand. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=494.38s)]
*  He is not there. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=501.3s)]
*  That was the surprising thing to me. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=503.5s)]
*  On that point, talking about being face-to-face with him, being in the same physical space [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=507.42s)]
*  with him for the first time since when you say he assaulted you in 1996, what you're [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=512.34s)]
*  describing there in terms of him being nothing, him feeling like an animal, him feeling not [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=519.5s)]
*  intimidating, was that a shock to you? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=525.1s)]
*  Your guts here, your bravery here includes the physical bravery about being around him [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=528.7s)]
*  again. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=532.5s)]
*  It sounds like it didn't go the way you expected it to once you were in the same room. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=533.5s)]
*  No, Rachel, I was terrified. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=536.5s)]
*  I was just a bag of sweating corpuscles as we prepared for trial. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=539.7s)]
*  Four days before trial, I had an actual breakdown. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=548.86s)]
*  I lost my ability to speak. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=551.86s)]
*  I lost my words. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=554.1s)]
*  I couldn't talk and I couldn't go on. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=555.26s)]
*  That's how frightened I was. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=559.26s)]
*  But oddly, we went into court. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=561.26s)]
*  Robbie took the lectern. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=564.86s)]
*  I sat in the witness chair like this and she said, Miss Carroll, good morning. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=567.22s)]
*  Would you please spell your name for the court? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=573.26s)]
*  And amazingly, I looked out and he was nothing. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=576.66s)]
*  He was nothing. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=584.06s)]
*  He was a phantom. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=585.06s)]
*  It was the people around him who were giving him power. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=586.06s)]
*  He himself was nothing. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=589.76s)]
*  It was an astonishing discovery for me. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=592.8599999999999s)]
*  He's nothing. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=599.26s)]
*  We don't need to be afraid of him. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=600.6199999999999s)]
*  He can be knocked down twice by this woman right here. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=603.3399999999999s)]
*  I wasn't going to ask this, but and it may be rude. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=610.76s)]
*  You don't have to answer if you don't want. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=613.78s)]
*  I'll put this either to Miss Crowley or Miss Kaplan if either of you wants to field it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=614.9799999999999s)]
*  You are both very experienced trial attorneys. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=618.8199999999999s)]
*  You've been up against some of the best and brightest opposing counsel in all sorts of [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=620.9799999999999s)]
*  different trials. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=625.6999999999999s)]
*  How is President Trump's lawyering? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=627.2199999999999s)]
*  Is he well represented in court? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=630.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm going to let Crowley answer that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=634.5799999999999s)]
*  But I will say that what you heard just now in that tape of Alina Jaba leaving the court [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=637.66s)]
*  and kind of yelling at the reporters, that's what we heard every single day multiple times [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=644.42s)]
*  during this trial, but yelling at the judge. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=650.5799999999999s)]
*  And it was unbelievably nerve wracking each time it happened and it happens multiple times [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=653.8199999999999s)]
*  every day. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=659.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=660.8199999999999s)]
*  Thanks for handing that one over to me. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=661.8199999999999s)]
*  I think that she had a hard job and you could definitely see a difference between her sort [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=665.98s)]
*  of style when he was in the courtroom and when he was not there. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=674.9399999999999s)]
*  She was much more disciplined and frankly acted more like a lawyer when he wasn't there. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=679.8199999999999s)]
*  When he was, I mean you could hear him telling her when to object and muttering things and [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=686.18s)]
*  loudly being frustrated with her. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=691.0600000000001s)]
*  And I think she felt like she had to say things to the judge and to us and sort of put on [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=693.58s)]
*  a performance like you just saw in front of the TV cameras. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=698.86s)]
*  E.G. in terms of what you've just been through, I mean to hear a lawyer's experience as Ravi [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=703.1400000000001s)]
*  Kaplan say it was nerve wracking to be in that room sometimes because of the way this [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=710.0600000000001s)]
*  was conducted. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=713.5400000000001s)]
*  I have to ask you, you know, President Trump has kept your name out of his mouth since [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=714.9000000000001s)]
*  being told he has to pay $83 million to you for what he's done in the past. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=719.8s)]
*  But over the weekend he did start posting links online to articles that attacked you [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=723.8s)]
*  and denied your claims. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=729.88s)]
*  Again, he seems to be pushing it already in terms of whether or not he is going to go [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=731.4s)]
*  back to calling you a liar and denying that he did what he did. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=735.92s)]
*  If it came to it, if your lawyers told you that there was another case and that you should [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=741.76s)]
*  go back and get more money out of him, sue him again, would you do it? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=745.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=751.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=752.24s)]
*  It wasn't too much wear and tear on you. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=755.08s)]
*  I mean the guts factor here is real in terms of how much you put yourself out there. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=758.88s)]
*  A lot of big strong people have been putting themselves, wouldn't put themselves through [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=763.72s)]
*  what you've gone through. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=767.96s)]
*  Rachel, many people as you know have been through much worse than I went through at [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=769.28s)]
*  that trial. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=775.0s)]
*  People suffered more difficult things than I've ever been through in my life. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=776.16s)]
*  And I am more than willing to do it again because we achieved so much in a seven day [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=782.68s)]
*  trial. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=791.0s)]
*  We did what people thought was impossible. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=792.0s)]
*  We beat Donald Trump. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=795.62s)]
*  Let me ask you about a way that you have talked about this, E. Jean. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=801.32s)]
*  You have talked about the fact that this was not just you being passively victimized, but [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=805.36s)]
*  you thought that it was a fight and that's the term that you used. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=813.44s)]
*  And everybody gets to choose their own terms to describe it as something like this happening [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=818.84s)]
*  to them. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=823.2800000000001s)]
*  But you chose that term and it seems like it's important to your sense of self and to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=824.2800000000001s)]
*  your own sense of agency and knowing who you are and making decisions about what to do [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=829.48s)]
*  next. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=834.1999999999999s)]
*  What you just did 25 years after the assault was a different kind of fight, going at him [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=835.84s)]
*  at the height of his power and the height of his celebrity. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=840.8s)]
*  And I wondered if you could just talk about that self-conception and why it's important [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=843.4s)]
*  to you to know for yourself that you fought, but also so that the world knows that you [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=847.9599999999999s)]
*  both did fight and that you will fight. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=853.3s)]
*  Well, we're fighting not really, Rachel, for me. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=856.4399999999999s)]
*  It's now about fighting for all women. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=860.4399999999999s)]
*  We're also fighting and we salute the women and men who've been assaulted and who did [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=862.68s)]
*  not survive. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=869.8399999999999s)]
*  We are doing this for women around the country who have been knocked down repeatedly. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=872.0799999999999s)]
*  And so it's really not about me anymore. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=880.7199999999999s)]
*  We have moved beyond me. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=883.88s)]
*  And as you say, the fight now is really to take back our future. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=885.52s)]
*  This is a man who stacked the Supreme Court, took away women's rights over their own bodies. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=890.4399999999999s)]
*  We would like to be a part of turning our eyes to the future and taking back our rights. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=897.14s)]
*  You've talked about using some of Trump's money that you're about to get to help shore [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=907.48s)]
*  up women's rights. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=912.24s)]
*  Do you know what that might be, what that might look like? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=913.6s)]
*  Yes, Rachel. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=917.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=918.04s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=919.04s)]
*  I had such great ideas for all the good I'm going to do with this money. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=920.04s)]
*  First thing, Rachel, you and I are going to go shopping. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=926.28s)]
*  We're going to get completely new wardrobes, new shoes, motorcycle for Crowley, new fishing [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=929.2s)]
*  rod for Robbie. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=935.54s)]
*  Rachel, what do you want? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=936.54s)]
*  A penthouse? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=937.54s)]
*  It's yours. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=938.54s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=939.54s)]
*  A penthouse and France? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=940.54s)]
*  You want France? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=942.74s)]
*  You want to go fishing in France? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=943.74s)]
*  No? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=945.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=946.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=947.54s)]
*  That's a joke. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=948.54s)]
*  Although if me fishing in France could do something for women's rights, I would take [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=951.54s)]
*  the hit. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=956.54s)]
*  I would obviously take one for the team. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=957.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=961.54s)]
*  As if you need persuasion in that regard. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=964.54s)]
*  Let me finish with a final question. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=966.54s)]
*  And again, this is both for you, Sean, and for you, Robbie, and you guys can divide up [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=968.54s)]
*  responsibility here. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=972.54s)]
*  But there are multiple cases here involving Trump that are coming up. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=973.54s)]
*  Obviously, most eyes are on the federal January 6th case, having been up against Trump in [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=978.54s)]
*  the courtroom. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=984.54s)]
*  I'm wondering if you two have any advice in terms of what it's like to go up against him [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=985.54s)]
*  and his legal team in terms of the way that he approaches his defense. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=989.54s)]
*  That's part of it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=991.54s)]
*  But I also want to know if this big, what everybody's expecting potentially to be a [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=992.54s)]
*  very large judgment against him and his company changed anything about the way that you [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=996.54s)]
*  approached the ask to the jury, the way that you presented evidence, the way that you're [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1001.54s)]
*  planning on making sure this money is, in fact, extracted from Trump's wallet. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1006.54s)]
*  I mean, how much do all of these different cases interact with each other, if at all? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1010.54s)]
*  And can various lawyers involved in these various cases learn from each other's experience? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1014.54s)]
*  So the short answer to do the cases all interact with each other is absolutely all the time. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1020.54s)]
*  To give you just one good example, in our case, we played at the end of our case not [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1026.54s)]
*  only the deposition that I took of Donald Trump in this case, but we played the deposition [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1032.54s)]
*  that the New York Attorney General took in their case, because in that deposition, Trump [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1038.54s)]
*  is bragging about how his brand alone is worth more than $10 billion. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1043.54s)]
*  He has $400 million cash on hand. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1049.54s)]
*  And the reason that was so relevant is in assessing how much money to work for punitive [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1052.54s)]
*  damages, the jury is not only allowed to but supposed to think of the wealth of the defendant. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1056.54s)]
*  So when we said, when Sean said, give him enough, give enough to Eugene to make him stop, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1062.54s)]
*  they had to think what enough would be for Donald Trump. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1069.54s)]
*  So the cases in kinds of predictable ways and unpredictable ways are kind of talking to each other all the time. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1072.54s)]
*  On the first question, you know, I think that one thing that I maybe wasn't prepared for [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1080.54s)]
*  coming into this trial is that when Donald Trump is stripped of, you know, all of the press [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1086.54s)]
*  and not at a rally and there's no TV cameras and he sort of has a small group of supporters around him, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1094.54s)]
*  he's not that scary. And he also can be controlled. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1101.54s)]
*  You know, I mean, his antics in the courtroom, we've talked about them. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1106.54s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he did kind of follow the rules. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1109.54s)]
*  Robbie Cross examined him. He was in he was in the witness chair and he only got to answer three questions, I think. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1113.54s)]
*  And he pretty much stayed within the bounds. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1120.54s)]
*  I think when you have a strong judge like Judge Kaplan, who enforces the rules of his courtroom [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1124.54s)]
*  and you have real lawyers, you really can get him to behave sort of. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1130.54s)]
*  And when he is stripped of all of the rallies and the truth socials, he's just a guy. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1135.54s)]
*  I think E. Jean called him the emperor with no clothes. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1141.54s)]
*  That's not my quote, but he definitely is. He's not the guy that you see on TV. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1145.54s)]
*  He's just a guy sometimes acting like a petulant toddler, but just a guy. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1151.54s)]
*  An American bound by the law, just as every American is bound by the law. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1158.54s)]
*  Writer E. Jean Carroll, attorney Robbie Kaplan, attorney Sean Crowley. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1164.54s)]
*  You guys have made history a couple of times now, and you also have meant a lot and continue to mean a lot. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1168.54s)]
*  You have been lighting the way, I think, for a lot of people in terms of both moral clarity and strategic acumen. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1176.54s)]
*  And I really, really want to thank each of you for making the time to come talk to us. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1182.54s)]
*  And I wish you all safety and rest. Thank you. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmtaIAGklng&t=1186.54s)]
