Video Description: Donald Trump says the scandal over his top officials discussing secret military plans in an unsecured group chat is just a "glitch" in an otherwise perfect first two months in office. Rachel Maddow looks back to help Trump jog his memory and realize that "perfect" is probably not the best word for what has happened so far in Trump's second term.

# 'Two perfect months?!': Trump's rationalization of insecure group chat scandal backfires
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA)
*  President Trump has not fired anyone for this debacle, which is astonishing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=0.0s)]
*  He did confess to NBC News in a new interview that he sees this as a, quote, glitch. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  A glitch. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  He said this scandal has been, quote, the only glitch in two months. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  This is kind of emerging as his take on this scandal. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=17.44s)]
*  He told reporters yesterday, they've made a big deal out of this because we've had [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=21.3s)]
*  two perfect months. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=25.68s)]
*  Basically saying that this scandal, with all of his senior appointees, including this White [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=29.88s)]
*  House Chief of Staff, all discussing these forthcoming battle plans over Signal in a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=35.08s)]
*  group text that they didn't notice included in a journalist. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=42.48s)]
*  He thinks this is all a hoax. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  This is now he's used the phrase witch hunt. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=46.32s)]
*  This has all been ginned up as if it's something bad. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=48.5s)]
*  They're trying to make it look bad because he's otherwise had two perfect months. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=51.76s)]
*  This is the only thing that even looks bad. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=55.64s)]
*  Everything else has been. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=58.04s)]
*  And you know, I will just say between you and me, you have been alive for these past [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=59.04s)]
*  two months and you have experienced what the first two months of this Trump term have been [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=67.32s)]
*  like. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=73.64s)]
*  Do you think that Trump is right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=74.64s)]
*  That it's all been totally perfect? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=76.78s)]
*  This has been the only glitch? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=79.36s)]
*  I mean, just, you know, back of the envelope scratching here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=81.0s)]
*  It was a week or so after he was sworn in January 29th, a jet carrying 64 people hit [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  an army helicopter above the Potomac River outside Reagan National Airport in D.C. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=92.48s)]
*  Everybody on both aircraft killed the day before that collision. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=96.68s)]
*  He had offered air traffic controllers all across the country a somewhat threatening [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=99.26s)]
*  buyout trying to basically beg them to leave government service. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=104.48s)]
*  Less than a week later, Trump reversed course. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=108.88s)]
*  Oh, actually, no, maybe that's a bad idea. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=110.76s)]
*  Air traffic controllers, please don't leave. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=112.88s)]
*  That same week was when we started to get the headlines about the kids who Trump's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=116.0s)]
*  top campaign donor, Elon Musk, had brought in to his new agency to work with him to destroy [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=119.28s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  It turns out one Doge staffer actually had to resign when it came out that he had a since [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  deleted social media account in which he had advocated for loud and proud racism and racial [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=131.74s)]
*  human breathing tactics through eugenics. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=137.6s)]
*  They soon hired him back. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=141.92s)]
*  Another Doge staffer had been previously fired from a cybersecurity firm for leaking company [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=143.76s)]
*  secrets. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=148.28s)]
*  He also worked at a startup that hired convicted hackers. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=149.28s)]
*  He went by the online moniker Big Balls. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=152.76s)]
*  We would later learn that Trump and Elon Musk and their infinite wisdom specifically gave [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=155.24s)]
*  Big Balls, who again had been fired from a previous job at a cybersecurity firm for [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=160.32s)]
*  leaking company secrets. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=165.0s)]
*  Trump and Musk gave that specific kid access to the systems at the top U.S. cybersecurity [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=166.96s)]
*  agency. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  Great choice. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  Then Trump fired the staff of the nation's nuclear security agency, the people who oversee [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=176.28s)]
*  the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=181.8s)]
*  Then Trump scrambled to unfire all of those nuclear safety workers because oops, but in [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=184.28s)]
*  many cases they couldn't figure out how to reach them because in their infinite wisdom [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  They forgot to collect contact information from those nuclear security workers before [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=193.44s)]
*  cutting them all off from their government email accounts. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  This includes people with Q level security clearances who are cleared for access to our [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  nation's top nuclear secrets. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  Those are great folks to lose track of and to fire for no cause. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=207.0s)]
*  Trump then fired people at the CDC in charge of tracking the ongoing bird flu outbreak. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=211.76s)]
*  That turned out to be a mistake as well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  They then tried to hire all those people back but didn't get them all back. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=218.2s)]
*  Trump then instituted not only firings but a hiring freeze that applied to, among other [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=223.76s)]
*  things, the national parks. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  Why is it particularly bad to do that at the national parks? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=231.0s)]
*  Well, among other things, the national parks every year have to hire a whole new cast of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=233.48s)]
*  employees for seasonal employment because the national parks have greatly increased [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=238.88s)]
*  visitors during vacation season. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=244.16s)]
*  The hiring freeze isn't going to work at the national parks, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=247.68s)]
*  You have to hire lots of new people every year. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=249.84s)]
*  So they did that and then oops, turns out they realized they couldn't do that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  Turns out it would be wildly dangerous to radically understaff American national parks. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=256.96s)]
*  Who knew? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=261.36s)]
*  So they had to reverse that too. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=262.36s)]
*  Then a few days after that reversal, we saw them again scrambling to rehire people they [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=263.36s)]
*  had fired from the FDA this time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=267.44s)]
*  Headline. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=271.32s)]
*  FDA scrambles to rehire entire teams overseeing medical devices after Doge fired them all, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  saying their terminations are, quote, rescinded effective immediately. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=280.56s)]
*  By this point, we're about a month in to the perfect two months. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=284.76s)]
*  It was February 22nd, just about exactly a month in, when Elon Musk sent his first What [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=291.08s)]
*  Did You Do Last Week email. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=296.52s)]
*  He demanded that all federal employees email his Doge teenagers a list of what they got [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=298.64s)]
*  done that week or else it would be cause for immediate firing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  That threat then promptly was deflated. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=308.2s)]
*  Within 24 hours, the leaders of multiple agencies in the government, people in Trump's cabinet [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  like Tulsi Gabbard, say, told their workers and their agencies explicitly don't reply [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=314.8s)]
*  to Elon's email. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=319.84s)]
*  Whomp, whomp. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=321.12s)]
*  At that point, Elon Musk had a running list of all the massive and spectacular savings [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=322.12s)]
*  he and his kids at Doge had found by cutting out supposed fraud and waste from the federal [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  government. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=332.0s)]
*  They claimed to have found billions of dollars in fraud. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=333.0s)]
*  It was all on their website for you to see. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  But then, February 25th, the New York Times reported that the five largest items on that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=336.88000000000005s)]
*  list had just quietly disappeared because it turns out they hadn't actually saved all [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=342.12s)]
*  that money. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=345.76000000000005s)]
*  They'd just done all the math wrong. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  Day after the rug was pulled out from under Doge on that, they had to erase another big [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=349.04s)]
*  cut from their list. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  Doge claimed they had found $2 billion of waste and fraud to cut out from VA. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  Turns out a lot of that money was for stuff like, oh, I don't know, medical services for [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=359.8s)]
*  veterans, cancer programs for veterans with cancer, burial services for veterans who die. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=364.04s)]
*  Boy, that really does sound wasteful, right? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=370.64s)]
*  So yeah, again, oops, they had to reverse course on that, reinstate some of that stuff. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  Saturday after that was March 1st. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=380.48s)]
*  We learned another obvious but alarming side effect to all of Trump and Musk's firings [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=382.32s)]
*  through the federal government. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  CNN reported that U.S. intelligence showed that Russia and China were rushing to take [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  advantage of the moment and working hard to recruit as many disgruntled workers as intelligence [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=392.20000000000005s)]
*  assets as they could get. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  You tired of all the winning yet? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=401.6s)]
*  You tired of all the perfection? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=402.6s)]
*  The very next day, Sunday, March 2nd, the Dow started its trip off the cliff after Trump [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=404.48s)]
*  said he was going to go through with his tariffs on our closest trading partners like Mexico [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  and Canada and also China. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=416.44s)]
*  The next day you could watch live on the Fox News channel as the stock market tumbled down [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=418.88s)]
*  and down and down while Trump doubled down, down, down on his tariffs. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=423.16s)]
*  Since then, we've seen industry after industry come forward to say just how much the tariffs [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=427.68s)]
*  have been just slaying them economically, but Trump is plowing ahead. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=431.6s)]
*  A week after tanking the stock market with that insipid trade war, Trump pulled yet another [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=435.76000000000005s)]
*  reversal since taking office. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=440.76000000000005s)]
*  He's been insisting on using military aircraft for deportations, been making a huge deal [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=442.76000000000005s)]
*  about these deportations, deporting migrants, many of whom we now know had no criminal history [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=447.92s)]
*  whatsoever, but he wanted to make a big deal out of the fact that he was using military [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=452.56s)]
*  aircraft to send them where? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=456.48s)]
*  To Guantanamo. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=458.44s)]
*  Very transparent stunt to get footage like this to use for propaganda purposes. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=460.68s)]
*  It was also unbelievably, eye-wateringly expensive. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=464.92s)]
*  So quietly on March 5th, they stopped using the military aircraft. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=469.64s)]
*  And a week later, they stopped using Guantanamo. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=473.76s)]
*  They returned everybody they'd been holding their back stateside. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=476.52s)]
*  Because they'd already got all their propaganda films made. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=480.56s)]
*  Don't tell anybody we're just not doing that anymore. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=484.0s)]
*  Along the way, in their hunt to rid everything in the federal government of diversity, equity, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=486.72s)]
*  inclusion, they purged a photo of the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Japan from [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=491.0s)]
*  a Defense Department database. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=496.16s)]
*  We believe that's because the plane, the Enola Gay, has the word gay in its name. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=498.04s)]
*  So obviously just having pictures of that plane anywhere is going to make everybody [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=503.96000000000004s)]
*  gay. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=507.08000000000004s)]
*  Look what it did to me. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  The next week, people still employed by the FDA and ordered back to the office told reporters [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=510.56s)]
*  they had returned to find offices that could not fit them with broken equipment and not [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=514.44s)]
*  enough chairs for people to sit in. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  Last week, Trump released the JFK assassination files, unredacted, including 400 unredacted [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=521.1600000000001s)]
*  Social Security numbers and birth dates and birthplaces. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=526.36s)]
*  Trump managed, among other things, to dox his own lawyer, who only found out Trump had [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=530.0s)]
*  done it when a reporter called to ask him about it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=534.0s)]
*  Also, last week, the New York Times was first to report that Elon Musk was about to get, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=536.2s)]
*  a top secret briefing for the U.S. military plan for any war that might break out with [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=541.6s)]
*  China. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  After he says he saw that report, Trump, quote, contacted White House Chief of Staff and Defense [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=550.48s)]
*  Secretary Pete Hegseth, White House Chief of Staff Suzy Wiles and Defense Secretary [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=555.6s)]
*  Pete Hegseth to ask them, Hey, what's this briefing you're doing for Elon? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=560.12s)]
*  That sounds like a big deal. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=564.2s)]
*  He learned about it in the New York Times, he says. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=566.14s)]
*  And so then they called it off. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=568.76s)]
*  And briefly, that was a, you know, stop everything. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=571.84s)]
*  What the heck is going on? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=574.92s)]
*  News, right? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=575.92s)]
*  The president's top campaign donor with all of his business ties to China and his multi [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=576.92s)]
*  billion dollar debts to the Chinese getting a briefing on the U.S. military plans for [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=581.68s)]
*  going to war with China. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=586.64s)]
*  But I mean, just to show you how these first two months of the Trump term is going, here's [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=590.24s)]
*  the news from the very next day after Trump announced there would be no such Elon Musk [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=592.84s)]
*  China war plan briefing. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=597.28s)]
*  This is the Washington Post Saturday, March 22nd, just four days ago. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=598.8s)]
*  Tax revenue could drop by 10 percent amid turmoil at IRS. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=604.84s)]
*  Staff cuts and disruptions related to Doge have officials bracing for a sharp loss of [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=609.32s)]
*  revenue for the U.S. government. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=613.92s)]
*  The predictions of the prediction officials say is directly tied to changing taxpayer [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=615.64s)]
*  behavior and President Trump's rapid demolition of parts of the IRS. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=619.96s)]
*  Neat. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=627.44s)]
*  Seems like Doge, if those predictions seem to be borne out at IRS, will have succeeded [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=628.44s)]
*  in robbing the United States government of a half trillion dollars in revenue it would [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=634.6s)]
*  have otherwise received because, again, in their infinite wisdom, they have decided to [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=640.6800000000001s)]
*  destroy the IRS, which collects money to fund the government. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  Everybody who's ever run a business knows that the most efficient thing you can do and [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=652.2s)]
*  get in your bottom line straight of your business is to make sure you no longer have the capacity [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=656.2s)]
*  to earn any money. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=660.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=661.8000000000001s)]
*  It's been perfect. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  These two months have been, other than this little glitch with the giant group text about [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=666.08s)]
*  forthcoming military operations, everything has been perfect. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S90nh3Ys3BA&t=669.4000000000001s)]
