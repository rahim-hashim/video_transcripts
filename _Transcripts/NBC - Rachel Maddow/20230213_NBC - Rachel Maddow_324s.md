# Unnerving authoritarian patterns seen from right-wing U.S. governors
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg)
*  Viktor Orban, in Hungary, just like Vladimir Putin in Russia, he also led his country into [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=0.0s)]
*  a full-blown moral panic about gay people and trans people. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=6.0s)]
*  And in both countries, they used that in particular as a way to not just hurt and scapegoat queer [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=11.66s)]
*  people, they used it as a way to consolidate yet more control over the media and over schools [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=18.0s)]
*  at all levels. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=24.96s)]
*  In Orban's case, he then led a moral panic about schools themselves, declaring war on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=26.32s)]
*  the one truly prestigious internationally influential graduate school in Hungary, a school called [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=32.36s)]
*  Central European University. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=37.52s)]
*  Central European University is very influential and important in Hungary. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=39.52s)]
*  It had an important publishing house, a really important library, a very important and highly [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=43.04s)]
*  ranked law school. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  Viktor Orban couldn't stand that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=49.84s)]
*  He demonized it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=52.0s)]
*  He forced that university out of Hungary altogether in 2019. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=53.0s)]
*  This past year, he took control of 11 more universities. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=58.58s)]
*  And then after eating his way through the media and eating his way through academia, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=64.6s)]
*  just like Putin, he then ate the judiciary too. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=72.42s)]
*  Orban forced out judges in huge numbers and then appointed all their replacements. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=75.88s)]
*  And then he just created a whole new court system in which he appointed everyone in it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=81.68s)]
*  And they all report to him, including him deciding which cases go to which judges on [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=86.02000000000001s)]
*  an individual level on his own say so. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  Once he got complete control of the judiciary, he wrote himself a new constitution in which [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=96.76s)]
*  he gave himself the power to do all the things that had previously been struck down as unconstitutional [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  when his country used to have real courts. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  It is easier to see it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=112.28s)]
*  It is easier for us as Americans to see these patterns when they're farther away, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=113.76s)]
*  When we can see them in other countries, particularly when we can see them happening simultaneously [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=118.84s)]
*  in different countries that are all run by authoritarian leaders. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=122.68s)]
*  And the patterns aren't that hard to discern, because you see the same ones in history that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=128.48s)]
*  you see in modern life. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=132.32s)]
*  All authoritarians kind of do all the same things. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=134.56s)]
*  Authoritarian rule is a pretty simple thing, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=137.88s)]
*  The basic idea of authoritarian rule is, I'm in charge, nobody else gets a say. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=140.96s)]
*  If that's your goal, your roadmap basically only has one road on it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=145.88s)]
*  Set about making sure that nobody else has a say. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=151.56s)]
*  Set about undermining and disempowering any other institution, any other entity that might [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  challenge you or tell the truth about what you're doing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  Undermine it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=165.88s)]
*  Disempower it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=166.88s)]
*  Take it over. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=168.52s)]
*  Shut it down. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=169.52s)]
*  Kill it off. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=171.08s)]
*  It's the same pattern everywhere. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=172.08s)]
*  It's the same playbook everywhere. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=173.08s)]
*  And that is why it is unnerving to see elements of the American right going for it in the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  small ways where they can, too. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  They can't do it federally, but they're doing it in the states wherever they can, right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=186.62s)]
*  I mean, what's called Central European University in Viktor Orbán's Hungary might reasonably [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  be called the new College of Florida here in the United States, where the ambitious, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=198.02s)]
*  hard right Republican governor of that state moved quickly from stoking a moral panic about [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=203.98s)]
*  gay people and trans people to asserting ideological control of education broadly and then demonizing [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=209.26s)]
*  and taking over one scapegoat college in particular. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=218.22s)]
*  You might also see some of this at work just today in West Virginia. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=223.02s)]
*  NPR reporting on how Republican Governor Jim Justice in West Virginia has declared war [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=227.22s)]
*  on West Virginia public broadcasting, which is increasingly important as a news source [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=233.02s)]
*  in West Virginia, particularly as the news business has led to the collapse of lots of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  local newsgathering operations. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=242.54000000000002s)]
*  But at West Virginia Public Broadcasting, Jim Justice has decided that's got to go, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=244.22s)]
*  too. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  So he's gotten rid of the professional leadership. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  He installed his own communications director as the new CEO, and now they've started firing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=252.64s)]
*  reporters who have reported on scandals and failures in Governor Justice's administration. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=258.41999999999996s)]
*  And I could describe that West Virginia situation as a scandal. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=266.41999999999996s)]
*  I think for most Americans who value the idea of a free and independent press, it would [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=269.7s)]
*  be seen as a scandal. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=274.4s)]
*  But just watch. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=275.8s)]
*  If what Jim Justice is doing with the media in West Virginia, if that starts getting national [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=277.08s)]
*  attention, just watch. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=281.44s)]
*  Other Republican governors will see what he's doing and try to emulate it themselves, because [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=282.92s)]
*  this is what's in style right now on the American far right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=287.36s)]
*  It is a race to outdo each other with this stuff now. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=293.3s)]
*  And we know where it ends. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=297.48s)]
*  We've seen this playbook lots of different places. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=300.24s)]
*  We can see it all around the world. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq-2Wa7xirg&t=302.08s)]
