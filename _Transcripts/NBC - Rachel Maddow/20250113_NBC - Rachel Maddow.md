# Trump disposition discouraging as scale of L.A. fire disaster calls for federal coordination
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk)
*  Joining us now from near the Palisades fire is our own NBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=0.0s)]
*  who has been doing just tremendous work covering the story. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=5.0s)]
*  Jacob, thanks for being with us tonight. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=8.0s)]
*  Rachel, thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=10.0s)]
*  I know you've spoken to a lot of residents from evacuation zones in the past few days. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=13.0s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of what proportion of people, how many of the people you're talking to actually know the status of their homes right now? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=18.0s)]
*  Oh, I think, I mean, I think that the assumption for most people, Rachel, is that their homes are gone. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=27.0s)]
*  You know, I grew up here in Pacific Palisades. This was a Ralph's supermarket. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=33.0s)]
*  This is one of the two supermarkets that me and my mom and my family used to go to. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=36.0s)]
*  Pacific Palisades and Altadena, for that matter, but really here in the Palisades, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=41.0s)]
*  this community has effectively been wiped off the map of Los Angeles. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=46.0s)]
*  This is a city that is a patchwork of communities, and the Palisades is one of them. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=49.0s)]
*  And it has essentially ceased to exist. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=54.0s)]
*  We're talking about 5,400 structures, largely homes, that are gone. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=57.0s)]
*  And it is an incredibly eerie feeling to be here tonight. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=63.0s)]
*  The power is still out in the Palisades. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=66.0s)]
*  If these TV lights weren't here, it would be pitch black. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=69.0s)]
*  And, you know, first among the concerns are what's going to happen over the course of the next day or so with these winds picking up. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=72.0s)]
*  More than anything, there is an incredibly enormous recovery effort that has to take place and has to begin right now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=79.0s)]
*  And I talked to Governor Newsom yesterday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=85.0s)]
*  He said it's going to take nine to 12 months alone just to clear the debris, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=87.0s)]
*  the environmental remediation before they can even start building here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=91.0s)]
*  He said it was the worst natural disaster in the history of the country based on cost alone. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=94.0s)]
*  Wow. Jacob, I mean, to that point, Los Angeles, we talk about it as L.A. as if it's one thing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=99.0s)]
*  It's 88 independently incorporated cities. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=105.0s)]
*  That is, you know, interesting in terms of the way things run at the best of times. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=108.0s)]
*  But in the worst of times, it raises interesting questions about how the cities and the county and the state and the federal government are all interacting both to protect people, but also to to to recover and respond. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=112.0s)]
*  Who is really leading right now? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=124.0s)]
*  If you can tell that from your reporting. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=127.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=129.0s)]
*  The city alone is over 400 square miles and there are four million residents within it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=131.0s)]
*  But L.A. County is the most populous county by population in the nation with with more than 12 million people. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=135.0s)]
*  It's run by a board of supervisors. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=139.0s)]
*  And the city, of course, is run by L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, who is getting an incredible amount of criticism here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=141.0s)]
*  You know, she's come back from this international trip and briefed people almost on a daily basis. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=147.0s)]
*  But you haven't seen her much out and about. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=151.0s)]
*  At least we requested to talk to her tonight for you on the Rachel Maddow show. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=153.0s)]
*  And and they didn't get back to us. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=158.0s)]
*  I think people want to hear from from the mayor of L.A. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=160.0s)]
*  They want to hear from the governor who has been out on the streets. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=163.0s)]
*  But there are many questions yet to be answered. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=166.0s)]
*  And obviously, the federal government is going to play an enormous role here, too. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=168.0s)]
*  President Biden has committed this 100 percent disaster recovery for six months. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=171.0s)]
*  But you were just talking about in the last block of the show that the Trump administration is starting in a matter of days. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=176.0s)]
*  And President Trump has been calling the response by both Mayor Bass and Governor Newsom, criticizing it at every turn. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=181.0s)]
*  What is he going to do? Is he going to step up and is he going to provide additional aid? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=189.0s)]
*  This is something on the scale of which I think we haven't really seen before. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=192.0s)]
*  And it is going to require sort of a multi-jurisdictional during the fire itself. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=196.0s)]
*  There were fire agencies and first responders all throughout California, actually from Canada and Mexico as well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=200.0s)]
*  It's the type of recovery mission that we're going to need here in L.A. too. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=205.0s)]
*  And I don't really think that the contours of that are particularly well defined yet. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=209.0s)]
*  And granted, we're only six days into this. Tomorrow will be the one week anniversary, if that's the right word, of this all starting. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=215.0s)]
*  But this is going to be a project that Governor Newsom calls it a Marshall Plan for Los Angeles. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=222.0s)]
*  We don't even know what that looks like yet. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=227.0s)]
*  And, Jacob, I mean, in terms of the scale of this, it is hard to understand the scale of the destruction. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=230.0s)]
*  That's part of why I showed that map where you can click on individual properties, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=236.0s)]
*  individual homes and see photos that have been taken from these site surveys. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=239.0s)]
*  Just try to get a sense of the overall scale of it and the individual granular tragedy that this represents for each home, for each family that's affected. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=242.0s)]
*  Is it your sense? I mean, Katrina was so big that the federal government came in and took over the response. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=251.0s)]
*  Is it your sense that this is of that kind of scale that you would expect the federal government, if it was so inclined, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=257.0s)]
*  to come in and say, we're helming this, we're taking over. This is a national, this is a disaster of national scale? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=264.0s)]
*  You know, I'm a reporter, I'm not an urban planner, but I don't see how you do this on a piecemeal basis. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=272.0s)]
*  There are 1,600 National Guard troops from California here on the ground. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=279.0s)]
*  But effectively, you have to move out everyone in Pacific Palisades, the toxic fumes and the toxic chemicals that are permeating this community. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=284.0s)]
*  You have essentially thousands of people who are made instantly homeless in the unhoused capital of America on top of an already strained system. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=292.0s)]
*  What are you going to do with all of these people? Where are they going to go? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=300.0s)]
*  And then how are you going to, you know, are you going to go block by block and have contractors do this on an individualized basis? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=303.0s)]
*  I don't see how that happens and happens in a timely manner. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=309.0s)]
*  They have got to clear these communities out, remediate them, make sure they're environmentally safe to go back in, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=312.0s)]
*  make sure that the building materials are all up to par, that a fire like this doesn't happen again and bring back a community. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=318.0s)]
*  The Palisades alone has 23,000 people. How do you do this without the federal government? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=324.0s)]
*  And I don't think that we know, again, the answer to that question tonight, Rachel. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=329.0s)]
*  NBC's own Jacob Soboroff in his hometown of Pacific Palisades. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=334.0s)]
*  Jacob, I know this has been a 24-7 around the clock and very emotional beat for you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=338.0s)]
*  Thanks for being here with us tonight, my friend. I really appreciate it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=343.0s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. I really appreciate it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=347.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHYzAhtcajk&t=359.0s)]
