# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 21
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo)
*  Here's what Mr. Burns and Mr. Martin say about Kevin McCarthy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=0.0s)]
*  Quote, on January 10th, so four days after the attack on the Capitol, Kevin McCarthy [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=4.68s)]
*  convened a small group of House Republican leaders to share his thinking. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=9.84s)]
*  Speaking with just three other top Republicans on a private call, McCarthy said he might [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=14.08s)]
*  call on Trump to resign. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=18.46s)]
*  He conferred for more than 45 minutes with Steve Scalise, Liz Cheney, and Tom Emmer, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=21.56s)]
*  the Minnesota congressman who led the House Republicans campaign committee. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=27.24s)]
*  The usually upbeat Mr. McCarthy was audibly anguished. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=31.24s)]
*  The gravity of the attack was still sinking in, and it seemed increasingly clear to him [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  that he had to break with Trump. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=39.099999999999994s)]
*  It was finally time to end their alliance. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  His plan, McCarthy said on that January 10th call, was to approach President Trump and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=44.32s)]
*  tell him it was inevitable that Congress would impeach him and it was time for him to go. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=49.08s)]
*  He envisioned telling Trump of an impeachment resolution, quote, I think this will pass, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=54.92s)]
*  and it would be my recommendation you should resign. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=61.52s)]
*  I think this will pass, meaning the impeachment resolution will pass, meaning you will be [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  impeached. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=69.52s)]
*  Quote, it would be my recommendation that you should resign. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=70.52s)]
*  McCarthy said near the end of the call, quote, I've had it with this guy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=75.0s)]
*  What he did was unacceptable. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=79.06s)]
*  Nobody can defend that and nobody should defend it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=80.84s)]
*  Now, it is one thing to know that Kevin McCarthy once felt that way and once told his colleagues [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=85.16s)]
*  that he intended to do those things that he described. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=93.2s)]
*  And of course, now you couldn't slide a sheet of paper between him and Trump. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=96.84s)]
*  He decided to just jettison those apparently principled concerns and pledge his loyalty [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=100.2s)]
*  to Trump once again. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=106.28s)]
*  I mean, that's one thing that tells you something about Mr. McCarthy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  In their new book, Mr. Martin and Mr. Burns call it simply surrender by Mr. McCarthy. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=111.88s)]
*  That's the word they use. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=117.2s)]
*  But you know, it's another thing entirely for him to deny that this all happened when [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=118.2s)]
*  in fact it happened. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=125.6s)]
*  In a statement to the New York Times earlier today, a spokesman for Kevin McCarthy issued [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=127.96s)]
*  a flat denial that McCarthy ever said he would push Trump to resign. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=131.7s)]
*  That spokesman said, quote, McCarthy never said he'd call Trump to say he should resign. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=135.9s)]
*  McCarthy never said he'd call Trump to say he should resign. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=140.34s)]
*  To further clarify, you should also know that NBC News reached out to the congressman's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=147.46s)]
*  office following that statement, specifically asking again and drilling down on the question [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=152.26s)]
*  of whether or not Mr. McCarthy said he would push President Trump to resign. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=158.18s)]
*  His spokesman responded saying, quote, no, he did not. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=164.0s)]
*  Leader McCarthy also issued a statement himself today saying in part, quote, the New York [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=171.26s)]
*  Times reporting on me is totally false and wrong. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=174.34s)]
*  The problem with these denials from Mr. McCarthy in his office is that we have now obtained [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=178.1s)]
*  audio of that January 10th phone call that Leader McCarthy held with other top Republicans [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=182.86s)]
*  in which he in fact said he's going to call Trump and tell him that he must resign. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=188.38s)]
*  The authors of this new book, Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns from the New York Times, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=194.68s)]
*  they have shared that audio of this call with us so that we can share it with you tonight [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=198.04s)]
*  so that you can know that when Kevin McCarthy denies that this happened, he is not telling [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=202.84s)]
*  the truth. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=208.88s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=209.88s)]
*  Liz, you on the phone? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=211.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm here. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=213.88s)]
*  Thanks, Kevin. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=214.88s)]
*  I guess first a question. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=215.88s)]
*  When we were talking about the 25th Amendment resolution, and you asked what happens if [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=216.88s)]
*  it gets there after he's gone, is there any chance, are you hearing, that he might resign? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=223.88s)]
*  Is there any reason to think that might happen? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=228.88s)]
*  I've had a few discussions. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=232.88s)]
*  My gut tells me no. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=236.88s)]
*  I'm seriously thinking about having that conversation with him tonight. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=238.88s)]
*  I haven't talked to him in a couple days. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=244.88s)]
*  From what I know of him, I mean, you guys all know him too. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=248.88s)]
*  Do you think he'd ever back away? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=251.88s)]
*  But what I think I'm going to do is I'm going to call him. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=253.88s)]
*  This is what I think. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=258.88s)]
*  No, it'll pass the House. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=263.88s)]
*  I think there's a chance it'll pass the Senate even when he's gone. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=265.88s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of different ramifications for that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=271.88s)]
*  Now, I haven't had a discussion with him that if he did resign, would it not happen? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=274.88s)]
*  Now, this is one personal fear I have. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=281.88s)]
*  I do not want to get into any conversation about, hence, pardon me. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=285.88s)]
*  I mean, the only discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=290.88s)]
*  And it would be my recommendation you should resign. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=295.88s)]
*  I mean, that would be my take, but I don't think he would take it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=300.88s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=305.88s)]
*  The discussion I would have with him is that I think this will pass, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=309.88s)]
*  meaning the impeachment resolution will pass, and it would be my recommendation you should resign. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=312.88s)]
*  I mean, that would be my take. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=318.88s)]
*  It would be my recommendation, Mr. President, that you should resign. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=321.88s)]
*  That's what Kevin McCarthy told other House Republicans on January 10, 2011, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=325.88s)]
*  that he was going to call President Trump and tell him the impeachment was going to pass and he needed to resign. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=332.88s)]
*  Mr. McCarthy flat out and categorically denied that today. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=337.88s)]
*  He denied that he said he would tell Trump to resign. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=340.88s)]
*  He, in fact, said exactly that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=343.88s)]
*  And, Jonathan, let me ask you about another bombastic allegation, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=347.88s)]
*  or at least bombastic reality that you guys portray in this same chapter of the book, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=352.88s)]
*  which is that Mr. McCarthy also, according to your reporting, called for more members of his caucus, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=356.88s)]
*  other Republican members of Congress, to have their Twitter accounts cut off, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=361.88s)]
*  the same way that Trump was cut off from Twitter. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=364.88s)]
*  He's also denying that he said that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=367.88s)]
*  What is your reaction to that denial? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=369.88s)]
*  I can't quite do a mad-al style justice here, but I'll try. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=371.88s)]
*  If you take yourself back to this period, January of 2021, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=375.88s)]
*  remember, President Trump was widely seen after January's exit as potentially inciting a second attack on the Capitol. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=380.88s)]
*  And so Twitter took action and removed him from that platform. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=388.88s)]
*  And so what McCarthy is talking about is he's hearing from his fellow GOP leaders on this call [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=394.88s)]
*  about some of the more bombastic tweets from far-right members of the House caucus [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=402.88s)]
*  who are looking for any rationalization about the attack of January 6. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=407.88s)]
*  And McCarthy says out loud on this call, can't they take their Twitter accounts away, too? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=412.88s)]
*  Which is striking given his tough talk today about taking on high-tech companies, big tech companies, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=420.88s)]
*  in this private conversation that we have on tape. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=427.88s)]
*  He suggested that those big tech companies he wants to crack down on actually should crack down on members of his caucus, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=430.88s)]
*  the very members who he is now courting assiduously to try to keep happy so that he has the votes to become speaker next year. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=437.88s)]
*  And it's a striking moment in this conversation because he's almost pulling his hair out. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=444.88s)]
*  You can sort of hear the anguish in his voice as he's talking about, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=450.88s)]
*  what else do I have to deal with beyond President Trump and my own members? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=453.88s)]
*  And he's deeply frustrated in that period. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=458.88s)]
*  And once again, the McCarthy office denied that fact. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=461.88s)]
*  And it is a fact. It's on tape that he said this sort of pining away, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=467.88s)]
*  hoping that Twitter could strip some of his own members of their accounts. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=472.88s)]
*  So just to underscore this, just to be clear, Mr. McCarthy and his office have denied that he said he was going to call Trump and tell him to resign. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=476.88s)]
*  You have it on tape. We just heard that he in fact said that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=484.88s)]
*  He's also he's also today denied that he called for members of his own caucus, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=487.88s)]
*  other House Republicans to have their social media access cut off. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=492.88s)]
*  You've also got that on tape. That's correct. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=495.88s)]
*  And we have a lot more on tape from this period, which is at the highest levels of American politics. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=499.88s)]
*  It is it is sensitive. It's delicate and it's high stakes. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=505.88s)]
*  And we have it all on tape. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=509.88s)]
*  And it's going to, I think, tell a very different story about this period than the story that many people are trying to tell right now. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=511.88s)]
*  Joining us now are New York Times national political correspondents, Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=520.88s)]
*  They are the authors of the forthcoming book, This Will Not Pass, Trump, Biden and the Battle for America's Future. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=525.88s)]
*  Mr. Burns, Mr. Martin, thank you very much for being with us tonight and congratulations on this book. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=531.88s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. Thank you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=536.88s)]
*  Let me first just ask both of you, give you each a chance to chime in if I got any of that wrong or if I put the emphasis in the wrong place or got any of it just the wrong way around. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=538.88s)]
*  No, I think you very much captured it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=547.88s)]
*  And I would just say for the book buying audience out there, for people who work in politics, this is only the start. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=550.88s)]
*  We have captured some of the most intimate and sensitive conversations in the extraordinary period following January 6th on tape. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=557.88s)]
*  And there is much more to come between now and when the book is out on May 3rd. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=567.88s)]
*  But what you played there really does capture, Rachel, where Kevin McCarthy was. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=573.88s)]
*  He was looking for a way out. He thought Trump had become toxic. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=579.88s)]
*  He was Trump's biggest ally during the four years of the Trump presidency. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=583.88s)]
*  And here he is looking for an escape hatch. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=587.88s)]
*  How do I get rid of this soon to be former president? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=591.88s)]
*  And what do I have to do to sort of make myself cleanse from him somehow, some way? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=595.88s)]
*  And he comes to maybe I have to ask him to resign, which, of course, famously is what Barry Goldwater did with President Nixon during the Watergate scandal. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=601.88s)]
*  What's different here is that in the subsequent weeks, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=610.88s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy realized there was not the will in his caucus to make such a call to President Trump [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=614.88s)]
*  and that his members were deferring to their voters who just did not want to move on President Trump. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=620.88s)]
*  They were in angry at him over January 6th. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=626.88s)]
*  And McCarthy is down at Mar-a-Lago before the month is out and patching up his relationship with President Trump. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=628.88s)]
*  And now we know that they're back together again. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=635.88s)]
*  Well, thank you both. I have to thank you for allowing us to hear and to play for our audience. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=640.88s)]
*  The the recording that backs up your reporting here. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=645.88s)]
*  Alex, I have to just ask what you make of the fact that Mr. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=648.88s)]
*  McCarthy and his office is denying that this ever happened, denying explicitly to New York, to NBC News today when we followed up with him about their denial on this, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=651.88s)]
*  explicitly clarifying that he never suggested he was going to make this kind of a call to Donald Trump. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=661.88s)]
*  It really does appear to not be the truth for Mr. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=667.88s)]
*  McCarthy. Well, that's a pretty diplomatic way of putting it, Rachel. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=670.88s)]
*  It was a totally bogus denial, as your audience just heard. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=674.88s)]
*  And I think that what this moment captures, in addition to everything Jonathan just said, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=679.88s)]
*  and what this tape in particular captures is just the staggering gulf between what Republican leaders say about Donald Trump in public [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=684.88s)]
*  and to his face and what they will say about him in private. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=693.88s)]
*  And I don't know that anybody should find it terribly reassuring that Kevin McCarthy is more clear eyed about Donald Trump and the dangerous force that he represented in January of 2021. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=697.88s)]
*  That he is more clear eyed about that in private than he is in public, because Rachel, this is an ongoing story. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=708.88s)]
*  We all know Donald Trump is preparing to run for president again. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=713.88s)]
*  We all know the way he talks about what happened in the 2020 election and the way he talks about what he believes should happen in the 2024 election. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=717.88s)]
*  And if past performance is any indicator of future results, what you heard on that tape and then what Kevin McCarthy did subsequently to hold Donald Trump to account, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=725.88s)]
*  which was nothing, is a pretty ominous story about the future. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=735.88s)]
*  And I don't mean to be Pollyanna about this at all or naive, but it seems to me that I sort of expect a certain level from politicians in particular, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=741.88s)]
*  that of saying one thing in public and saying it in another way in private, certainly speaking more harshly, less diplomatic terms in private. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=751.88s)]
*  What I don't expect is for even public officials, even politicians to flat out lie about what they have said when it is on the record, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=759.88s)]
*  when they have reason to believe it might have even been recorded and they just lie and deny that it happened. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=769.88s)]
*  I think this creates a real problem for Mr. McCarthy. I think he must at least apologize. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=774.88s)]
*  I would not be surprised if there would not resign calls for his resignation for him lying and denying that he did this when in fact he did it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=778.88s)]
*  But of course, he answers to his caucus. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=786.88s)]
*  Alan Foyer joins us now live. Mr. Foyer, I know you don't particularly relish being on TV to talk about your reporting. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=790.88s)]
*  It makes me all the more grateful for you being here with us tonight. Thank you. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=797.88s)]
*  Oh, well, thanks for having me, Rachel. I appreciate it. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=800.88s)]
*  Let me ask you first about this reporting about the prosecutor who's been put in charge of this part of the January 6th investigation. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=804.88s)]
*  What can you tell us about him and what exactly he's looking at that's different than all of the other prosecutors who have been at work on these cases? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=813.88s)]
*  Sure. So his name is Tom Wyndham. He was brought in from Maryland. He's a career prosecutor. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=820.88s)]
*  And although I don't know him personally, by all accounts, he's a kind of classic, you know, federal prosecutor type. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=827.88s)]
*  He's been described as diligent yet aggressive, sort of like forceful, but cool under pressure. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=834.88s)]
*  And his mandate is essentially to look at the question of whether or not there was criminal activity related to January 6th that took place after the January 6th investigation. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=841.88s)]
*  And he's been in the same place outside of the grounds of the Capitol. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=856.88s)]
*  As you said in your introduction, the Justice Department has been focused almost exclusively for more than a year on people who physically stormed the building. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=860.88s)]
*  They went in, they broke windows, they fought with cops, or maybe they didn't. They just trespassed and entered restricted areas. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=871.88s)]
*  There's a whole other group of people who were involved in the political rally at the ellipse, Donald Trump's ellipse event, that preceded that. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=879.88s)]
*  These are political organizers, speakers, sort of people described as VIPs, members of Congress who were involved in that event, people within the Trump administration who were involved in that event. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=889.88s)]
*  And the question is, did anything that they did help to kind of shape or inspire the violence and chaos that ultimately erupted? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=902.88s)]
*  And that's what Thomas Windham has been brought in to look at, to answer that question. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=913.88s)]
*  Are these, is this a seditious conspiracy question? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=919.88s)]
*  Is this the kind of potential prosecution that we have seen around, for example, the oath keepers and those guys, or is this a different set of potential charges? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=924.88s)]
*  I don't know, frankly. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=933.88s)]
*  But if I had to say, the seditious conspiracy charge that the oath keepers are facing, I think, is specifically related to the issue of the weapons that they had stored across the river in Virginia, allegedly waiting to be brought into play when needed. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=938.88s)]
*  If you look at things that, say, Representative Liz Cheney has said on the floor of the House about the behavior of former President Trump and others, the idea is that perhaps the charge here that may ultimately arise is a conspiracy to obstruct Congress and the work of Congress. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=961.88s)]
*  And that has been the Justice Department's kind of go-to charge to describe the very unique political crime that was committed on January 6, which is simply that by obstructing the peaceful transition of power, that was the crime that that was committed. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=990.88s)]
*  So look, we don't know what charge, if any, may ultimately be brought, but everything kind of points towards the notion of was there an effort to kind of obstruct the work of Congress right at the moment when lawmakers were doing the very crucial work of certifying the final results of the election. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1015.88s)]
*  Does Mr. Windom have a team? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1038.88s)]
*  Does he have considerable resources for this work? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1041.88s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1045.88s)]
*  The short answer to that is there doesn't seem to be a big team yet. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1048.88s)]
*  That said, we do know that, you know, at least one subpoena has gone out, and he's kind of overseeing that. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1054.88s)]
*  Ali Alexander, as you mentioned in your introduction, has been subpoenaed, and Windom is kind of shepherding that subpoena. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1064.88s)]
*  Whether or not there will be more people assigned to his particular team remains to be seen. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1074.88s)]
*  And don't forget there are 140 federal prosecutors sort of assigned to the investigation writ large. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1081.88s)]
*  And so the the job here is to see if what is the nexus between the people who are on the ground and the people who were away from the Capitol grounds? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1090.88s)]
*  You know, like I kind of think of it as suits and boots in a way. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1102.88s)]
*  And so a guy like Thomas Windom is presumably working closely with other federal prosecutors who are kind of steeped in the boots on the ground cases. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1106.88s)]
*  So, you know, we'll see kind of where that goes, you know, as the days and weeks go on. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1118.88s)]
*  Let me just ask you about what I described as the sort of cynicism, sort of healthy skepticism about the attorney general saying that everybody involved at every level will face accountability here. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1127.88s)]
*  What's your bigger picture view as to whether or not the Justice Department is willing to make even politically fraught determinations if that's where these that's where the suits part of this suits and boots investigation, as you describe it, might lead. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1137.88s)]
*  Look, I mean, you quoted Attorney General Garland in your introduction. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1154.88s)]
*  You know, he has said he's going to follow the evidence where it goes. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1158.88s)]
*  If you look at the case filings, right, it's very, very clear and has been from before the emergence of this kind of, you know, expanded vision of this case that the Justice Department is very homed in on what effect. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1161.88s)]
*  What does the former President Trump's words and actions had on people on the ground? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1180.88s)]
*  It's apparent in charging documents. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1186.88s)]
*  It's apparent in what are called statements of offense when people plead guilty. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1189.88s)]
*  It's just very clear if you pay attention to the paperwork that the Justice Department is aware of the effect that Trump's words had on on people on the ground. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1194.88s)]
*  You know, whether that results in a criminal case, that's just not something that we can tell at the moment. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1206.88s)]
*  I would be surprised if the Justice Department knew at the moment. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1213.88s)]
*  But in terms of whether or not they are paying attention to it, it's very clear they are. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1216.88s)]
*  And now we know for certain that the Justice Department has kind of expanded its gaze, so to speak, and like looked beyond people who were on the ground that day to those who were off site but may have some sort of culpability. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1223.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDmzOjbxBuo&t=1253.88s)]
