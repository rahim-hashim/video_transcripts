Video Description: Not only is the Trump administration being cagey in court about details of its deportation flights shipping supposed Venezuelan gang members to be imprisoned in El Salvador, but Donald Trump is now acting like he didn't sign the order behind the deportation flights in the first place. Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, talks with Rachel Maddow about how things are progressing in court as the Trump administration now tries to claim state secrets prevent them to answering to a judge.

# 'It's really unbelievable': Trump deportation flights case takes a turn from insane to surreal
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg)
*  So, here's the proclamation that was sent out from the White House last weekend, invocation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Alien Enemies Act by the president of the United States of America. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=5.08s)]
*  This is the proclamation in which Donald Trump invoked a law from the 1700s that says, when [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=8.8s)]
*  we're at war, the president can immediately deport and jail anyone his administration [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=16.72s)]
*  picks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=22.04s)]
*  In this case, picks as belonging to a Venezuelan criminal gang, which is something that has [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=23.04s)]
*  nothing to do with wartime. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=28.56s)]
*  But regardless, they put this out, and there's Donald Trump's signature on the proclamation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=29.56s)]
*  Within hours of that proclamation, the Trump administration put hundreds of people on planes [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=35.16s)]
*  bound for a prison in El Salvador, and they had no legal process at all. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=39.84s)]
*  People were just grabbed, chained, and sent to a foreign prison. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=44.44s)]
*  A federal judge blocked any further flights like this and spent the week repeatedly grilling [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=49.8s)]
*  Trump administration lawyers about it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=54.5s)]
*  He said on Friday, quote, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=56.16s)]
*  Donald Trump, a couple hours after the judge said that, was asked about that when he was [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  departing for yet another weekend of golf, this time at his New Jersey golf club. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=80.08s)]
*  He's asked about, you know, why did you sign this in that in that weird time frame? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=85.68s)]
*  That why did you sign it in the dark in that way? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=89.64s)]
*  Watch what Trump said in response. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=93.12s)]
*  This was super weird. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=94.48s)]
*  I don't know when it was signed because I didn't sign it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=97.28s)]
*  Other people handled it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  But Marco Rubio has done a great job and he wanted him out. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=100.28s)]
*  And we go along with that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't know when it was signed because I didn't sign it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  You sure, big guy? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=113.08s)]
*  Because you're trying to blame Marco Rubio here, but that is not Marco Rubio's signature. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=114.56s)]
*  Do you not remember signing it? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=120.32s)]
*  Did you not sign it? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=123.2s)]
*  Somebody else put your name there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  When the White House was asked about Trump saying he totally did not sign that proclamation [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=127.8s)]
*  with his signature on it, the White House came up with a novel explanation. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=132.04s)]
*  They said, and I quote, President Trump was obviously referring to the original Alien [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=136.16s)]
*  Enemies Act that was signed back in 1798. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=141.56s)]
*  Oh, yes, obviously, the president of the United States obviously just thought he was being [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=145.0s)]
*  asked whether he signed a document more than 200 years ago. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=149.28s)]
*  And his answer was, no, no, no, other people handled that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=154.72s)]
*  Isn't Marco Rubio wonderful? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=157.24s)]
*  He was talking about 1798. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  That this proclamation at question is ostensibly the legal underpinning for this whole [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=163.44s)]
*  deportation operation, the sending flightfuls of people to a prison in a foreign country. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump's denial that he ever signed it is now obviously part of the ongoing legal fight. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=173.72s)]
*  The ACLU telling the judge in this case and its latest filing today, quote, there is now [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=179.36s)]
*  confusion as to when the proclamation was issued and whether the president signed it at [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=183.52s)]
*  all. Today, the Trump administration took this fight to an appeals court in Washington. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=188.0s)]
*  They want to resume more flights like this, like the one to El Salvador. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  It's not clear how the appeals court will rule or when. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  But meanwhile, the Trump administration just tonight has filed notice that it is invoking the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=202.64s)]
*  state secrets privilege, meaning they are claiming that for national security reasons, they [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=206.76s)]
*  don't need to provide the court any information about these deportation flights, even as we [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  still don't know who they deported. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  And even as attorneys and family members of the people they put on those flights say they [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=219.56s)]
*  can't get in touch with anybody who has been put in this prison in El Salvador. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=224.04s)]
*  It is an insane story from the very beginning, but it's now approaching surreal. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=228.48s)]
*  If the government says there's we don't have to give process for that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=233.6s)]
*  Then you're going to put me up on Saturday and throw me on a plane. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  Thinking I'm a member of Tren De Ragua and giving me no chance to protest it and say [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=244.12s)]
*  it's somehow it's a violation of presidential war powers for me to say, excuse me, no, I'm [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=249.56s)]
*  not. I'd like a hearing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=254.64s)]
*  You wouldn't say that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  Federal appeals court judge today incredulous that the Trump administration could argue [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=259.2s)]
*  they have the right to pick up anyone they want and deport them to a jail in a foreign [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=262.8s)]
*  country with no process at all, no explanation, not even a paper trail. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=266.76s)]
*  But that is what they're arguing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  Joining us now is legal aren't deputy director of the ACLU Immigrant Rights Project. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=272.96s)]
*  He was in court today arguing against the administration in this case. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=276.48s)]
*  Lee Mystical, it's nice to see you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=279.92s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=281.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=282.92s)]
*  We've just had news that the Trump administration is invoking the state secrets privilege in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=284.44s)]
*  this case. Can you tell us what that means? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=288.6s)]
*  Yeah. So this is just another incredible day in a series of incredible days in this case. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=291.92s)]
*  The judge said turn these planes around. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=298.72s)]
*  This was last Saturday night. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=301.56s)]
*  I guess, you know, now eight days ago when they were in the air because they were headed [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=304.32s)]
*  to El Salvador and he said, I don't think that this invocation of the 1798 act is legal. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=310.48s)]
*  They did not turn the planes around. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=317.6s)]
*  It was clear that the planes were in the air. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=320.12s)]
*  This is all public information. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=322.48s)]
*  They could have turned the planes around. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=324.16s)]
*  They could have brought people back once they landed. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=326.08s)]
*  And now the government, rather than answer the judges, understandable questions about [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=328.88s)]
*  what they did has invoked the state secrets act, meaning state secrets privilege, meaning [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=333.48s)]
*  that they're not going to answer the judges questions. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=338.4s)]
*  It's really unbelievable in this situation for the government to say, no, we're not going [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  to answer your questions. We're going to go as far as to call these state secrets facts, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  even though everyone knows when the planes were in the air. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  Lee, what do you make of the fact that the president is now denying having ever signed [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=354.52s)]
*  the Alien Enemies Act proclamation here? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=359.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know what to make of it, truthfully. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's why we filed something in court, as you mentioned, saying that among other [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  facts that we need are what's going on with this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=371.2s)]
*  Did the president sign it? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=374.12s)]
*  When did he sign it? And one thing we do know is that apparently it was signed on Friday, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=375.76s)]
*  March 14th. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  They started moving people before they actually published the proclamation on the afternoon, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=383.2s)]
*  Saturday afternoon, the 15th, which is completely against the way the act is supposed to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=388.72s)]
*  work. It says a public proclamation. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=394.4s)]
*  They started using its authority before they even let the public know that it had been [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  passed. Now, if the president didn't even sign it, that's yet a whole nother layer of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=401.08s)]
*  confusing facts that we need to find out. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=406.08s)]
*  It's the combination of like the maximum lawlessness and maximum consequences for the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  people who have been sent there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=415.96s)]
*  Yeah. League alert. Deputy director of the ACLU Immigrant Rights Project. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=417.52s)]
*  Ongoing story. Come back soon. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=421.2s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=422.64s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1nob1ocEGg&t=423.12s)]
