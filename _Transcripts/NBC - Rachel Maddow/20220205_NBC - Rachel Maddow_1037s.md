# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 4
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ)
*  Do not let anyone tell you there is a schism in the Republican Party or some sort of civil war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  There are two factions fighting it out. There's Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and those couple [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=4.48s)]
*  of RNC members dejectedly voting no today. And then there's everyone else in the party. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=9.52s)]
*  Because ever since that one time in 2016 that Donald Trump right here was forced in front of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=14.64s)]
*  a camera to say he was wrong and apologized, the ironclad rule of Trumpism and therefore [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=19.28s)]
*  the ironclad rule of the modern Republican Party is that Donald Trump is never wrong. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  Which is what made this today so remarkable. January 6th was a dark day in the history of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=32.64s)]
*  the United States Capitol. Lives were lost and many were injured. But thanks to the courageous [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=40.24s)]
*  action of the Capitol police and federal law enforcement, the violence was quelled, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=48.8s)]
*  capital was secured, and we reconvened the Congress that very same day to finish our work [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of this country. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=62.32000000000001s)]
*  There are those in our party who believe that as the presiding officer over the joint session of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=66.88s)]
*  Congress that I possess unilateral authority to reject electoral college votes. And I heard this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  week that President Trump said I had the right to overturn the election. President Trump is wrong. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=79.44s)]
*  What? Honestly, I was surprised that Mike Pence was not vaporized by lightning on the spot. I did [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=89.44s)]
*  not know a Republican could say the words, President Trump is wrong. I thought it was like saying [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=96.8s)]
*  Beetlejuice or Candyman. And while it's bracing to hear any Republican, let alone Donald Trump's [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=102.72s)]
*  vice president, say out loud that Donald Trump is wrong, you will note that Mike Pence also said [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=109.44s)]
*  that January 6th was, quote, a dark day in the history of the United States. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=116.08s)]
*  That may not seem controversial. It was certainly the national consensus not too long ago. But as [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=122.88s)]
*  of today, that kind of language puts former Vice President Mike Pence at odds not just with Donald [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=128.0s)]
*  Trump but with the Republican Party as a whole. January 6th wasn't a dark day. It was just legitimate [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=133.28s)]
*  political discourse, so says the Republican National Committee. And if you so much as dare [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=140.48s)]
*  to participate in an investigation of that day, you are no longer welcome in the Republican Party. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=145.52s)]
*  All week, Rachel and her team have been covering the despicable pattern of neo-Nazis [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=153.76s)]
*  across the country, feeling emboldened and gathering outside hospitals and on freeway [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=157.68s)]
*  overpasses, even phoning in bomb threats to historically black colleges and universities. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=162.16s)]
*  We're going to have an update tonight on the neo-Nazis that gathered last weekend in the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=167.28s)]
*  Orlando area. At one point during their demonstration, a young Jewish man, a college [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=170.8s)]
*  student in the area, confronted the neo-Nazis. He wanted to let them know that their hate had [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=175.12s)]
*  no place there. They subsequently surrounded his car, hurled anti-Semitic slurs, and spat on him. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Then they went on to punch him, kick him, and attack him with pepper spray. We've now learned [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=187.04s)]
*  that three of the neo-Nazis involved in that incident, including the group's leader, have been [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  arrested. Two of the neo-Nazis have been charged with battery and are now facing third degree [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  felonies under Florida's hate crime law for that assault. A third man has been arrested for grand [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=200.72s)]
*  theft after he allegedly took the young man's phone. It's a little bit of accountability, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=206.24s)]
*  although there's still a lot of work to be done. This show has been tracking all week the different [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  ways Donald Trump and his allies were actively trying this whole seize the voting machines [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=216.24s)]
*  thing in the wake of the 2020 election as part of their kitchen sink strategy to overthrow the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=221.68s)]
*  government. Well today, another layer of the onion peeled off. Emails and records obtained by CBS [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=226.88s)]
*  News suggest there were multiple versions of draft orders that called for the seizure of voting [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=234.56s)]
*  machines after the 2020 presidential election. This draft order, dated December 17th, would have [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=239.84s)]
*  empowered the Secretary of Homeland Security to seize, collect, preserve, protect, retain, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=246.4s)]
*  and analyze all machines. A day earlier, another draft order, reviewed by CBS News, looked to grant [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=252.56s)]
*  similar powers to the Defense Secretary. The draft, which contains one typo and no signature line for [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=259.6s)]
*  President Trump, is dated December 16th. Now that draft executive order apparently prepared for [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=266.24s)]
*  President Trump, that would have approved the seizure of voting machines. It was sent to a small [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=272.88s)]
*  group of the president's supporters who were working to overthrow the election. One of the people on [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=277.92s)]
*  that seized the voting machines email chain was Michael Flynn, Donald Trump's disgraced national [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=282.64s)]
*  security advisor. CBS News obtained an email from Michael Flynn back then in regard to that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=287.44s)]
*  draft executive order. He wrote, quote, fix the spelling error in the title and sure it gets a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=292.8s)]
*  legal review, but this is ready to go from my standpoint, end quote. Paired with that report [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=298.56s)]
*  from CBS, we also today learned in this deeply reported piece from Robert Draper at the New York [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=303.6s)]
*  Times Magazine that Michael Flynn was not just a proofreader on the seize the machines plan, he was [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=308.72s)]
*  an active participant with a very specific strategy in mind. Quote, while Trump-friendly lawyer Sidney [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  Powell was pursuing legal options for reversing the election results, Flynn was beginning to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=321.52s)]
*  envision a military role. By mid-December, Flynn was calling for sending in the military to the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=326.64s)]
*  contested states. By December 16th, one of the president's allies had lined up a series of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=333.44s)]
*  options for the president to consider, including using uniformed officials to confiscate voting [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=339.76s)]
*  machines and ballots in six states. Flynn suggested that the National Guard and U.S. Marshals [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=346.32s)]
*  in combination would be the most suited to the job, end quote. Joining me now is Robert Draper, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=353.28s)]
*  contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine. He's the author of this new deeply [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=360.24s)]
*  reported piece about Michael Flynn out in the Times today. He's also the author of the book [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  To Start a War, How the Bush Administration Took America Into Iraq. Mr. Draper, thank you for being [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=370.24s)]
*  with us this evening. My pleasure, Ali. I have to say, in reading your story, if I didn't know that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=375.84s)]
*  most of this was true based on leaks we'd have or things we'd understood, it feels made up. It feels [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  like a screenplay. I actually want to read a passage for our viewers just to set the scene. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=389.44s)]
*  You say that Flynn was encamped at the historic estate in South Carolina owned by Lin Wood, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  the Trump-supporting defamation lawyer who sued over George's election results. He had flown to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=400.0s)]
*  South Carolina on the private jet of the former Overstock chief executive Patrick Byrne and set [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=405.2s)]
*  up camp where he threw himself into the project of reversing the results of the election that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=411.28s)]
*  Trump had just lost. Sidney Powell brought along two law associates. The other guests were there to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=415.84s)]
*  gather and organize election information alongside her and Flynn. Among these was Seth Keschel, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=421.52s)]
*  a 36-year-old former Army military intelligence captain who told me he got Flynn's attention [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=427.52s)]
*  three weeks earlier by sending what he believed were suspicious election data to Flynn's LinkedIn [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=433.52s)]
*  page. Another, Jim Penrose, was a cyber security specialist who had worked for the National Security [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  Agency. A third, Doug Logan, was an associate of Byrne and the chief executive of a Florida-based [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=445.52s)]
*  software security firm called Cyber Ninjas. Wood and Byrne said the group had brought computers, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=452.24s)]
*  printers, and whiteboards. Quote, it looked like election central Wood recalled. That's remarkable. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=458.4s)]
*  Yeah, basically they spent things getting there and several days beyond that compiling supposed [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  evidence of fraud that they were getting over the transom through open sources, through people [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=472.0s)]
*  submitting affidavits and the like. And once they were compiling all of this, Ali, after they had [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=478.08s)]
*  done that, then they began to imagine, okay, since we believe we've conclusively proved fraud, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=482.4s)]
*  how can this be used as a basis for President Trump to reverse the election? And that in turn [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=488.32s)]
*  is what led to this military option you referred to before, where General Flynn was promoting the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  idea that voting machines and backup ballots could be seized in six contested states using [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=500.08s)]
*  the National Guard because they had a very good cybersecurity unit in them and the U.S. Marshals. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  And then once they had these machines and these ballots, then if President Trump wanted, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=515.76s)]
*  he could have on live stream TV all of them to be hand recounted and then the chips would [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=522.0s)]
*  supposedly fall where they may. But Flynn had said on a TV show roughly around this time, look, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  this is not that big a deal. Martial laws happen 64 times or so. But of course, the idea of sitting [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=532.8s)]
*  president having just lost an election, essentially saying, I don't like the outcome of this election [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=539.28s)]
*  and therefore seizing using the military all of the ballots in the contested states to order a [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=544.56s)]
*  recount truly unqualifies as exceptional. There were, according to your reporting, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=551.04s)]
*  there were enough people around there who were trying to outdo each other for who had the most [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=556.4s)]
*  dubious legal advice. But what was happening with Donald Trump? Was he trying to find the answer he [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=561.1999999999999s)]
*  wanted that would keep him as president? Or did he really believe there was fraud? What would all [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=567.1999999999999s)]
*  these recounts and seizing the machines do? It's, you know, it's a bunch of different questions. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=571.28s)]
*  There's a bunch of different answers on the question of whether or not President Trump believed that [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=577.6s)]
*  there was fraud. It's hard to get into the guy's psyche. I have talked to people who said that at [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=581.6s)]
*  times when they spoke to the president, they felt like he was kind of in on the joke, knew basically [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=586.9599999999999s)]
*  that election fraud had not occurred. But he certainly put on a convincing case of believing [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  that there was fraud to other people. I don't think that he was willing, however, to go to every [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=594.8s)]
*  conceivable means for whatever reason, though, as you referenced, Trump was interested in looking [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=599.6s)]
*  at, say, the Department of Justice, perhaps seizing the machines, then the Department of Homeland [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  Security. The military option was one that seemed to bother him. And Patrick Byrne, the overstock CEO, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  told me that he had a conversation later with Rudy Giuliani, and Giuliani had told Byrne why he had [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=615.76s)]
*  advised Trump not to go with the military option. He said, we will all end up in prison if we do that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=622.24s)]
*  Robert, we cannot do justice to the amount of reporting that you did in that fantastic [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=627.68s)]
*  piece. So I do recommend to our viewers that they read it. But thank you for being with us. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=630.9599999999999s)]
*  Robert Draper is a contributing writer for the New York Times Magazine. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=634.7199999999999s)]
*  This was the splash page of the Tallahassee Democrat yesterday. The top headline there says, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=639.76s)]
*  quote, Surgeon General got scathing review from UCLA in background check. The paper obtained that [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  background check through an open records request. It was conducted as part of Dr. Lattopo's Senate [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  confirmation process, which is currently ongoing. And it offers a searing evaluation of the state's [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=656.64s)]
*  top doctor from one of his former supervisors at UCLA. Here it is, quote, would you recommend the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=663.28s)]
*  applicant for employment as Surgeon General of Florida and confidence in his ability, honesty, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=670.8s)]
*  and integrity to perform related duties? The supervisor's answer, quote, no. In my opinion, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=675.84s)]
*  the people of Florida would be better served by a Surgeon General who grounds his policy [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=682.0s)]
*  in decisions and recommendations in the best scientific evidence rather than opinions, end [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=686.96s)]
*  quote. The supervisor added, by the way, that Dr. Lattopo's opinions published in a number of [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=692.96s)]
*  popular media outlets were contrary to the best scientific evidence available about the COVID-19 [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=697.92s)]
*  pandemic and caused concern among a large number of his research and clinical colleagues and [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=704.16s)]
*  subordinates who felt that his opinions violated the Hippocratic oath that physicians do no harm. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=709.52s)]
*  But we're not done. He continued. The situation created stress and acrimony among his co-workers [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=718.0799999999999s)]
*  and supervisors during the last year and a half of his employment, end quote. Okay, now I'm done. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=723.52s)]
*  How is that for a job recommendation? We reached back out to the Florida Department of Health for [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  comment. Their press secretary described the UCLA official as a disgruntled supervisor, adding that, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=734.48s)]
*  quote, doctors who were considered ahead of their time were applauded for their brilliance [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=740.64s)]
*  throughout history. But now appears that being at the forefront of ideas and following the data [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=744.96s)]
*  is now considered a political game, end quote. This is quite the backdrop against which Dr. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=751.12s)]
*  Lattopo is trying to get confirmed as Florida's top doctor. We covered Lattopo's first confirmation [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=758.72s)]
*  hearing last week, the same one in which he repeatedly refused to give a yes or no answer [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=764.08s)]
*  to a question about whether COVID vaccines work. The Democrats got up and walked out of that hearing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=769.2s)]
*  saying they were fed up with Dr. Lattopo's refusal to offer straight answers. Dr. Lattopo still has [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=776.8000000000001s)]
*  one more committee hearing before his nomination goes to a full vote in the Florida Senate. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=782.1600000000001s)]
*  So what can we expect? Well, joining us now is Florida State Senator Tina Polsky. She sits on [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=787.2800000000001s)]
*  the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee, which Dr. Lattopo will be testifying before next week. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=792.08s)]
*  Dr. Lattopo refused to wear a mask while visiting Senator Polsky's office last year, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=798.48s)]
*  even though she asked him to, citing a serious medical condition. Senator Polsky later revealed [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=803.36s)]
*  she was undergoing treatment for breast cancer. Senator, good to see you. Thank you for being [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=808.1600000000001s)]
*  with us this evening. Thanks, Ali, for having me. Good to see you. This is alarming. This is not a [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=812.4000000000001s)]
*  random job that Dr. Lattopo is going for. It doesn't vindicate him. All of these documents [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=818.32s)]
*  keep coming out to suggest that he's not in line with mainstream medical thinking, but the math [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=826.96s)]
*  we do here indicates that he is going to get his appointment. It certainly looks that way, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=832.08s)]
*  which is very frustrating because we only are a Senate of 40 people. We're close colleagues, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=838.1600000000001s)]
*  and yet we are so divided on issues such as this. So he is going to come before my committee. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=844.24s)]
*  There's four Democrats. We are outnumbered. We will ask lots and lots of questions. We will debate, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=850.48s)]
*  but he will get through. The next step is the floor. Unfortunately, we are again outnumbered, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=857.04s)]
*  and he will get the nom- excuse me, not the nomination. He's been nominated. He will [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=862.96s)]
*  become the permanent surgeon general. It's really frustrating because I know my colleagues know he [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=867.28s)]
*  is not the right person for the job. They sat there in the first committee. They heard his [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  non-answers. They know the background. They know how he treated me, and yet he's still going to [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=878.0s)]
*  be confirmed, and it's really frustrating. How did that go down, how he treated you? How does [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=883.04s)]
*  that work? Because even if we didn't have COVID, if somebody told me, could you please wear a mask [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=887.04s)]
*  because I'm immunocompromised, it's like it'd be a no-brainer. I'd wear the mask. What kind of [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=890.72s)]
*  response do you get to that kind of thing? What happened? It was just the most disrespectful [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=896.0s)]
*  since then. A lot of people haven't seen him interact, but when you saw his answers in the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=903.28s)]
*  first committee, vague and arrogant and smug is how I described him in my office, he tried to do [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=909.28s)]
*  the same thing in my office. We kind of have a waiting area. I asked him and his two colleagues [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=915.04s)]
*  to put on a mask before we went in to talk at the meeting which he requested, and he refused to do [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=919.92s)]
*  so and just stood there and tried to debate and give me alternative theories. Well, let's come up [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  with another option, and it's exactly the kind of nonsense that he spewed at the last confirmation [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=932.08s)]
*  hearing. Just talking, talking, I described it as word salad, and so it was exactly who he is. He [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=938.4000000000001s)]
*  has proven who he is over and over again, and the disrespect that he showed the senator coming to my [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=945.2800000000001s)]
*  office at his request, it was so simple to put on a mask, and had he done so, there would be no story. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=950.72s)]
*  So I just don't understand how a doctor can treat someone that way. I'm one of the 22 million [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=956.72s)]
*  citizens of Florida that he would be in charge of our public health, and he just didn't care. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  Do your Republican colleagues in the Senate care though, because they can't all be [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=970.5600000000001s)]
*  anti-mask, anti-vax, anti-science people? Like at some point he's the outlier. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=974.72s)]
*  They're not that way. I know they're not that way. There might be a few, but they're really not, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=981.12s)]
*  and I know that they're caring, but the political wins are such that they cannot go against this [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=986.0s)]
*  governor, and it's really sad and unfortunate. It's kind of the one good thing about being in [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=990.96s)]
*  the minority party is we can speak our minds, and the majority just seems to be locked in, and they [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=996.88s)]
*  don't ask questions, they don't debate, and they just kind of sit there and take it, and they will [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=1003.6s)]
*  vote him in. What strange times. Well, thank you for your efforts, Florida State Senator Tina [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=1010.0s)]
*  Polsky. We appreciate you being with us tonight. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41x1qe5DtLQ&t=1014.48s)]
