# U.S. GOP shows unique rejection of democracy with embrace of Trump: Maddow
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto)
*  One year ago today, supporters of the far-right, election-denying former president of Brazil, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=0.0s)]
*  Jair Bolsonaro, stormed the Brazilian Congress and Supreme Court and presidential offices. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=8.52s)]
*  They rioted. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=14.56s)]
*  They violently tried to overturn the results of the election in which their hero, President [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=16.28s)]
*  Jair Bolsonaro, had been voted out of office. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=20.72s)]
*  That was one year ago today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  And here today is New York Times Brazil bureau chief, Jack Nikas, writing about that parallel [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=26.86s)]
*  experience. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=33.02s)]
*  He said, quote, they were two shocking attacks on the Western Hemisphere's two largest democracies, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=34.02s)]
*  both broadcast around the world and both prompted by presidents who had questioned their legitimate [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=40.78s)]
*  election losses. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=45.94s)]
*  Each posed an extraordinary test of the country's democracy and each raised the question of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=47.34s)]
*  how a deeply polarized society would move forward in the wake of such an assault. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=52.22s)]
*  With time, the answer to that question is becoming clear. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=57.98s)]
*  The parallel attacks have had nearly opposite aftermaths. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=60.94s)]
*  In the United States, support is soaring for Donald J. Trump's campaign to retake the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=65.46s)]
*  White House as he frames his 2020 election loss as the real insurrection and January [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=71.02s)]
*  6th as a, quote, beautiful day. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=76.3s)]
*  At the same time, his counterpart in Brazil, the far right former president Jair Bolsonaro, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=78.78s)]
*  has quickly faded into political irrelevance. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  Six months after he left office last year, electoral officials barred him from running [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=86.46000000000001s)]
*  again until 2030 and many right wing leaders have shunned him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=91.26s)]
*  Why have there been such contrasting reactions to such similar threats? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=96.98s)]
*  Researchers and analysts point to a multitude of reasons, including the country's differing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  political systems, media landscapes, national histories and judicial responses. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=105.46s)]
*  But one difference especially stands out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=110.61999999999999s)]
*  Steven Levitsky, a Harvard professor of government, co-author of the book How Democracies Die, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=113.3s)]
*  who has studied both the American and Brazilian democracies, says that leaders on Brazil's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  right, quote, publicly, clearly, unambiguously accepted the results of the election and did [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=123.13999999999999s)]
*  exactly what democratic politicians are supposed to do. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=128.66s)]
*  He says, quote, that is strikingly different from how Republicans responded in the United [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=132.34s)]
*  States. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=137.46s)]
*  Jair Bolsonaro and Trump both stoked their supporters into a violent effort to seize [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  power by force after losing an election. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=145.34s)]
*  Bolsonaro has since become totally irrelevant in politics in Brazil, while Trump is still [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=148.38s)]
*  at the head of the Republican Party in the United States and is poised to become the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=153.86s)]
*  party's nominee for president again. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=157.46s)]
*  Now, part of that is, yes, that a Brazilian court ruled that Bolsonaro cannot run for [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=160.98s)]
*  office again until 2030. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=167.14s)]
*  He is disqualified from politics for the time being because of what he did. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  For Trump in this country, it's an open question as to whether he might face the same kind [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=176.56s)]
*  of disqualification. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  The super conservative US Supreme Court will take up that question just one month from [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  today on February 8th. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  It's partly a matter of whether or not there's a judicial penalty for effectively waging [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=191.22s)]
*  war against your own country's democracy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=196.5s)]
*  But it's also a matter of how Republicans, how the party, how American Republican leaders [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=200.57999999999998s)]
*  have reacted to this violence from their own leader, how they have reacted to this anti-democratic [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=207.06s)]
*  turn in the leadership of their party. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  It is not just a Trump problem. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=215.04s)]
*  It's that Republicans like what Trump did and they don't mind the idea of him doing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=218.38s)]
*  it again. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=222.66s)]
*  Republican members of Congress and US senators still voted to throw out the results of the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  2020 election the night after the violent attack on Congress in January 2021. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=229.26s)]
*  Even today, polls in Iowa ahead of next week's caucuses show that Trump's pledge to root [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=237.3s)]
*  out his enemies like vermin, claims like that make Iowa Republican voters more likely to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=242.9s)]
*  vote for him, not less. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=248.5s)]
*  When Trump was criticized for saying that immigrants are poisoning the blood of America, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=250.82s)]
*  when he was criticized for that because that's literally what Adolf Hitler said about non-Aryans [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=254.74s)]
*  in Mein Kampf, that claim from Trump pulled so well among Republicans and was so well [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  received among Republican voters that he not only has kept using that same language over [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=264.7s)]
*  and over again, he's now sort of institutionalizing it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=269.4s)]
*  Today, the new anti-Nikki Haley ad that the Trump super PAC put up is an anti-immigrant [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=272.82s)]
*  ad that is titled Poisoning to remind people that Trump has adopted that Hitler phraseology. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=277.54s)]
*  Republicans like this stuff. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=288.94s)]
*  In Brazil, the right did not like this stuff and they rejected Jair Bolsonaro's efforts [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=290.98s)]
*  to stay in power by force. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=295.78s)]
*  And that now means that Bolsonaro is exiled and irrelevant. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=297.48s)]
*  But where did Bolsonaro exile to? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=302.74s)]
*  Where did he go when he fled Brazil fearing prosecution? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=306.62s)]
*  He fled to Florida, to Ron DeSantis' Florida, where, as if the point wasn't clear enough, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=312.7s)]
*  pro-Trump Republican groups have greeted him like a hero. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=319.1s)]
*  Bolsonaro greeted with a hero's welcome at the pro-Trump Turning Point USA Florida event [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=332.74s)]
*  in Orlando. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=342.06s)]
*  He loves them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=344.06s)]
*  They love him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  Bolsonaro rejected in his own country, rejected by the right wing in his own country for his [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=349.02s)]
*  effort to violently overthrow the second largest democracy in the Western Hemisphere. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=353.32s)]
*  He is celebrated by the Republican right wing in this country. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=357.68s)]
*  He's celebrated in his own country, celebrated by our right wingers, where the effort to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=361.92s)]
*  violently overthrow the largest democracy in the Western Hemisphere, us, has just been [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=366.52000000000004s)]
*  taking a three-year breather and they're going to put up the guy who tried it again. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=370.90000000000003s)]
*  It is not a Trump problem. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=374.92s)]
*  It's a Republican party problem. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=378.76s)]
*  This is what they want. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=381.36s)]
*  Other right wingers who have charismatic leaders like Trump around the world don't necessarily [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  get behind them when they try violence to stay in power. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=388.0s)]
*  Our Republicans do. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beXA3S65mto&t=391.22s)]
