# Arizona GOP Election Rejecting Zeal Could Boomerang On Party's Candidates
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw)
*  In the great state of Arizona, today is the deadline for every county in the state to certify [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=0.0s)]
*  the election results from the midterm elections. Three of the state's counties waited until today's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=4.8s)]
*  deadline to actually take their vote on certification. Mojave County flirted with maybe refusing to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=10.0s)]
*  certify their election results today, but ultimately after two long meetings, they did vote unanimously [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=17.04s)]
*  that they would certify. Cochise County had previously tried to insist that they would only [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=23.12s)]
*  count their votes by hand, something they proved immediately and definitively unable to do. You [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=29.04s)]
*  might remember that ultimately they ended up abandoning their hand count when a court ordered [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=34.72s)]
*  them to do so. Well today, Cochise County declined to certify their election results. They decided [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=39.68s)]
*  they apparently don't care about the deadline to certify. They say they're going to talk about [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=46.72s)]
*  certifying again at another meeting they're going to hold on Friday of this week. But again, today's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  the deadline by which they needed to act. They did not act. Because of that, Cochise County is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=56.8s)]
*  now facing two lawsuits to try to compel them to certify the vote. The question then of course [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=62.64s)]
*  immediately arises if the courts do end up ordering Cochise County to certify the election results, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=69.36s)]
*  will Cochise County obey the court's order or will they defy it? And if they defy it, then what happens? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=75.12s)]
*  There's another deadline rapidly approaching December 8th. That's the deadline for the whole [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  state of Arizona to certify the election results statewide. Now theoretically, if Cochise County [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=86.56s)]
*  makes it to then, makes it to December 8th, while still refusing to certify the votes for their county, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=92.72s)]
*  theoretically that would mean that Arizona would certify the vote count for every county except [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=99.84s)]
*  Cochise County. Cochise County voters wouldn't have their votes added to the state vote totals. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=105.84s)]
*  If that happens, which would be crazy, that might actually end up resulting in some races having their [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=112.56s)]
*  results flipped. Cochise County votes very heavily for Republicans. If none of that county's votes [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=118.72s)]
*  are going to count because the county won't certify them, then some Arizona races that went to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Republican candidates might end up flipping to the Democrat instead once you subtract all the heavily [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=129.12s)]
*  Republican votes from Cochise County. That of course would be completely nuts, particularly [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=134.72s)]
*  because the reason Cochise County supervisors aren't certifying the election results there [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=139.68s)]
*  is not because they think anything fishy happened in their own county. It's because of things they've [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=144.08s)]
*  heard that sound bad to them about the elections in other places, specifically in Maricopa County, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=149.12s)]
*  Arizona, which is Arizona's biggest population center. Today the Maricopa County Board of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=156.0s)]
*  Supervisors voted unanimously to certify their county's election results, but they only took [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=161.28s)]
*  that vote after a tense four-hour-long public meeting filled with a very excitable group in a [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=165.52s)]
*  very packed auditorium. Shame to hell to Maricopa County for dragging our fine Arizona straight to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=172.72s)]
*  the toilet. This is vote trafficking at its finest. I've seen the criminal element. You are vote [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  traffickers. You are boat trafficker. Criminal. You're not losing friends because of the way that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=189.2s)]
*  you handled this election process. You're losing friends because you're evil and corrupt and you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=194.95999999999998s)]
*  know it. Okay. I came here today to get an up close and personal look at the seven traitors to the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  United States Constitution. Again, please. Sitting at that desk, the voting board of the state [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=207.12s)]
*  to the United States Constitution. Again, please. The voting booth is supposed to be a time for a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=213.2s)]
*  peaceful revolution. Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  necessary. That was Maricopa County, Arizona today as they nevertheless voted to certify [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=230.32s)]
*  that county's election results. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm8oR7P1wHw&t=238.32s)]
