# DeSantis Surgeon General Pick Stumbles Through Evasions Instead Of Straight Answers
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE)
*  One other thing to know about Dr. Latipo is that he has not actually yet been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=0.0s)]
*  confirmed in this post as Florida's Surgeon General. Governor DeSantis put [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  him up for the job months ago and he's been essentially functioning as [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=9.96s)]
*  Florida's Surgeon General for the last several months, but he does ultimately [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=13.92s)]
*  have to be confirmed by the state Senate in Florida. Yesterday he appeared before [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=17.28s)]
*  the Florida Senate for his confirmation hearing and it was it was it was something. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=22.8s)]
*  Thank you so much Mr. Chair and thank you Dr. Latipo for being with us today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=29.64s)]
*  Do you believe vaccines work? You're recognized for a series of answers. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=37.24s)]
*  Thank you, thank you Senator. I consider vaccines in the same way that I [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=44.8s)]
*  consider other medical therapies. What we care about clinically is whether they [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  are safe and effective and that is the lens through which I evaluate all [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=57.28s)]
*  medical therapies. Do you believe that vaccines in fighting against a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  pandemic like COVID-19 are effective? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=69.12s)]
*  You're recognized. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=74.56s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for your question Senator. So again, I would I would say [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=77.6s)]
*  that the question is a scientific one and it's one that is answered with data. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=82.88s)]
*  So the question is informed by data on specific outcomes and specific [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=89.52s)]
*  specific therapies. So that's the scientific question. Mr. Chair, just a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  couple more follow-up. Just a yes or no. Do vaccines work in fighting against [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=110.92s)]
*  COVID-19? Yes or no? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=116.04s)]
*  You're recognized. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=119.92s)]
*  Senator, I just I as a scientist, you know, I am compelled to answer the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=121.48s)]
*  scientific question and I'd be happy to answer any specific scientific question [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=130.2s)]
*  that you have related to vaccines and COVID-19. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=136.4s)]
*  Scientifically, do vaccines, does the do the vaccines work against preventing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=140.44s)]
*  COVID-19? Yes or no? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=146.28s)]
*  Recognized. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=151.2s)]
*  Okay. Well, thank you again, Senator. So, you know, yes or no questions are not [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=151.84s)]
*  that that easy to find in science. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=158.12s)]
*  That's the Democratic leader of the Florida State Senate, Senator Lauren Book, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=163.48s)]
*  struggling valiantly to try to get an answer out of Governor Ron DeSantis's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  handpicked Surgeon General for the state of Florida. Senator Book and her [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=174.0s)]
*  Democratic colleagues ultimately got up and walked out of that hearing, saying [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=178.24s)]
*  that they were fed up with Dr. Latipo's refusal to offer any answers to any [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=183.12s)]
*  questions. After that confirmation hearing, the Florida Sun Sentinel [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=188.52s)]
*  published this response from the paper's editorial board, quote, Joseph [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=192.68s)]
*  Latipo and his contrived evasiveness must go. Quote, Dr. Joseph Latipo is an [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=197.52s)]
*  expert, all right. He's masterful at dodging questions, insulting the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=201.84s)]
*  intelligence of Floridians and avoiding straight talk about the need to be [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  vaccinated against COVID-19. I'm married to data, Latipo told senators. The [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=208.52s)]
*  reality is that he's married to Governor DeSantis's agenda to politicize the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=213.0s)]
*  pandemic. The doctor does not deserve to be confirmed as Surgeon General, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=217.24s)]
*  especially now that he has shown that he has so little respect for the people of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  Florida that he wouldn't give them straight answers through their senators. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=224.28s)]
*  I mean, there are a lot of debates around the COVID-19 pandemic and our [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  response to it and effective policies and right. And some of those debates are [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=234.67999999999998s)]
*  absolutely worthwhile. It is, after all, a novel coronavirus. And so, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  therefore, we learn more about it scientifically as we move on in time and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=244.04s)]
*  we live with it for longer. Some of those debates are absolutely worthwhile, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  but some of them are ridiculous. And on the question of do the vaccines work, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=252.8s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. Seniors who are vaxxed are 50 times less likely to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=257.8s)]
*  be hospitalized with COVID than seniors who aren't. 50 times? That's not [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=265.36s)]
*  statistically significant enough for you? I mean, not to be weird, but even [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=271.68s)]
*  Donald Trump says the vaccines work. The vaccines work. But the Surgeon General [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=275.88s)]
*  of Florida cannot bring himself to say that. That is apparently a bridge too [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=282.64s)]
*  far for that state's top doctor. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nd_0IjmqWE&t=287.12s)]
