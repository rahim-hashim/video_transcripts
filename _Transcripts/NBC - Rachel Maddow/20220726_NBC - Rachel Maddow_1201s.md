# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: July 25
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0)
*  Do you recognize what this is? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=0.0s)]
*  It looks like a copy of a draft of the remarks for that day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=4.48s)]
*  And as you can see throughout the document, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=11.76s)]
*  there are lines crossed out, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=16.32s)]
*  there are some words added in. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=18.04s)]
*  Do you recognize the handwriting? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=23.12s)]
*  It looks like my father's handwriting. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=25.92s)]
*  It looks like my father's handwriting, says Ivanka Trump. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=30.04s)]
*  And luckily for us, he writes in gigantic capital letters in Sharpie. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=32.8s)]
*  So it's very easy for all of us to read. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=37.36s)]
*  And so we can now see easily what President Trump insisted he would not say, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=39.84s)]
*  what he changed in the speech that was written for him to be delivered on January 7th, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=46.24s)]
*  the day after the U.S. Capitol attack. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=50.72s)]
*  The draft that he was given starts, good afternoon. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=52.68s)]
*  He cut that out, OK. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=56.2s)]
*  Then it says, I would like to begin today by addressing, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=58.0s)]
*  and he gets the word today out of that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=60.84s)]
*  OK, all fine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=62.84s)]
*  The draft then says he should say that he is outraged and sickened by the violence. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=64.52s)]
*  He keeps the outrage. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=69.28s)]
*  He drops and sickened. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=70.48s)]
*  OK, he's just outraged, not sickened, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=73.32s)]
*  but we're basically still afloat here with the point of the speech [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=75.12s)]
*  until this next paragraph when we start to sink. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=78.4s)]
*  The draft says, quote, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=81.76s)]
*  I am directing the Department of Justice to ensure all lawbreakers are prosecuted [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=83.12s)]
*  to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=86.92s)]
*  We must send a clear message, not with mercy, but with justice. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=88.52s)]
*  Legal consequences must be swift and firm. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  He cuts all of that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=96.6s)]
*  He will not say he's directing the Justice Department to prosecute [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  to the fullest extent of the law, because, of course, he didn't do that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=102.88s)]
*  And he sure doesn't want to say that he's doing that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=105.44s)]
*  And here's the next bit that he cuts. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=109.16s)]
*  The draft written for him for his speech on January 7th says, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=110.84s)]
*  to those who engaged in acts of violence and destruction, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=114.68s)]
*  quote, I want to be very clear. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=117.12s)]
*  You do not represent me. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=118.84s)]
*  You do not represent our movement. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=119.92s)]
*  And if you broke the law, quote, you belong in jail. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  He cuts that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  He won't say that the people who broke the law on January 6th, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=127.48s)]
*  attacking the Capitol, belong in jail. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  And he won't even say that they don't represent him [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  and they don't represent his movement. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=134.72s)]
*  And you can see that all crossed out with his big Sharpie. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=136.76000000000002s)]
*  And then you can see in his big all-cap Sharpie handwriting [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=139.44s)]
*  where he swapped in his own language there. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=143.12s)]
*  He did say, instead of you belong in jail, he did say, you will pay. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=144.8s)]
*  You will pay. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  You will pay. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=153.72000000000003s)]
*  By which presumably he meant you will pay for tickets [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=155.56s)]
*  into my next round of for-profit Trump rallies, where I will praise you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  January 6th has become the Democrat Party's excuse to justify [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  an unprecedented assault on American civil rights and liberties, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=170.84s)]
*  appalling persecution of political prisoners. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=174.6s)]
*  Another thing we'll do, and so many people have been asking me about it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=178.16s)]
*  If I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6th fairly. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  We will treat them fairly. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=191.68s)]
*  because they are being treated so unfairly. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=195.72s)]
*  So right after the attack on the US Capitol by his supporters, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=201.12s)]
*  there's this draft speech written for him to give the next day. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=206.36s)]
*  And he only gives it to try to avert himself being forcibly removed from office [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=209.88s)]
*  by the cabinet invoking the 25th Amendment. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=214.04s)]
*  And that speech, the draft of that speech says, you don't represent me. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=216.44s)]
*  You don't represent our movement. You belong in jail. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=219.32s)]
*  He cuts all that and instead just says, you will pay. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=221.24s)]
*  And then by the time he's talking about it at his rallies, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=224.28s)]
*  not only is no one supposed to be paying anymore, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=226.76s)]
*  now they're unfairly persecuted patriots who are all getting pardons [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=229.20000000000002s)]
*  if he gets to be president again. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=233.52s)]
*  This is what happens when there are no consequences [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  for trying to orchestrate this type of attack on the country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  Have you ever heard of a man named Gerald L.K. Smith? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=244.68s)]
*  If you haven't, you are forgiven. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  He is no longer a famous figure, but in his day, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=251.84s)]
*  he was a famous-ish guy, a preacher and political figure. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=255.4s)]
*  At one point, he ran for Senate in Michigan as a Republican. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=259.72s)]
*  In 1944, he ran for president against FDR. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=263.48s)]
*  He ran on the ticket of the America First Party, which he had founded. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=267.44s)]
*  Gerald L.K. Smith did not get far with that presidential bid [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=272.52000000000004s)]
*  or with the Michigan Senate bid as a Republican either. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=275.36s)]
*  If Gerald L.K. Smith is remembered for anything today, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=278.92s)]
*  it's probably mostly for this. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=282.32s)]
*  This is a statue that he erected in Arkansas in the 1960s. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=284.96s)]
*  It's called Christ of the Ozarks. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=289.12s)]
*  Christ of the Ozarks was the subject of a huge, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=292.12s)]
*  a suspiciously huge fundraising operation by Gerald L.K. Smith. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=294.48s)]
*  He died in 1976, but that statue still stands in Arkansas today. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=299.32s)]
*  But Gerald L.K. Smith is about to have another moment in the public eye [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=304.32s)]
*  because what he really wanted to be remembered for, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=310.72s)]
*  even more than that statue, was a nationwide movement that he tried to build, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=314.16s)]
*  a movement that he named and that he led and that he promoted tirelessly [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=320.8s)]
*  and that he wanted to outlive him forever. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=326.36s)]
*  Motive behind the term Christian nationalist is easy to define and simple to interpret. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=331.0s)]
*  We believe that the destiny of America in relationship to its governing authority [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=337.0s)]
*  must be kept in the hands of our own people. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=342.08s)]
*  We must never be governed by alien. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=346.96s)]
*  We must keep control of our own money and our own blood. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=350.52s)]
*  In other words, we must remain true to the Declaration of Independence. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=354.64s)]
*  That is nationalism. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=360.96s)]
*  We believe that the spiritual symbol of our statesmanship is the cross, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=363.56s)]
*  which indeed is the symbol of Christianity. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=368.24s)]
*  We believe that the inspiring dynamic out of which America grew is Christianity. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=372.16s)]
*  We believe that there would be no real America such as we love [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=377.32s)]
*  and for which we're willing to die if there had been no Christianity. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=380.88s)]
*  Thus, when a Christian is a nationalist, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=386.28000000000003s)]
*  he becomes necessarily a Christian nationalist. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  A Christian nationalist. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  That was Gerald L.K. Smith speaking in the 1950s [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=396.88s)]
*  as both a sort of pseudo preacher and a political figure on the American right. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=401.24s)]
*  He was the spokesman and the founder for this movement that he called Christian [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=406.76s)]
*  nationalism. And if that is ringing a bell for you at all, if it feels, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=410.72s)]
*  despite the annoying music bed with that speech and the guy's weird speaking, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=415.44s)]
*  style and all that, if that language he was using feels like it, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=419.64s)]
*  it rhymes a little bit with today's news. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=423.8s)]
*  You are right about that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=427.44s)]
*  Republicans really need to recognize [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=430.8s)]
*  the people they represent, OK, their voters, not the lobbyist [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=434.4s)]
*  owners, not the corporate PACs, not not those people. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=438.0s)]
*  That's not who the Republican Party should represent. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=440.8s)]
*  We need to be the party of nationalism. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=443.8s)]
*  And I'm a Christian and I say it proudly. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=445.76s)]
*  We should be Christian nationalists. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  We should be Christian nationalists. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=450.68s)]
*  You are seeing that that phrase and that sort of branding [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=453.48s)]
*  from the Trumpiest members of Congress. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=457.8s)]
*  That's Georgia Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=459.52000000000004s)]
*  You're also seeing it all over the place in headlines now about the way [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=462.76s)]
*  the Trumpiest part of the Republican Party is kind of branding itself these days. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=465.88s)]
*  Christian nationalism on the rise and Republican campaigns. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=470.6s)]
*  Christian nationalism is reshaping the Republican Party. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=474.0s)]
*  The reason this Christian nationalism thing is an awkward fit, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=479.04s)]
*  the reason it's maybe not going to be an easy path [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=482.84s)]
*  for today's Republican Party, or at least it shouldn't be an easy path [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=486.12s)]
*  for today's Republican Party to bring this back, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=489.68s)]
*  is because they're not inventing this phrase for the first time. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=493.24s)]
*  And we're not ignorant to history and we know what it meant the last time. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=497.04s)]
*  Christian nationalism is not a new concept. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=501.24s)]
*  It's not a new American right-wing political concept. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=503.32s)]
*  The reason this ought to be awkward for them to try to bring it back [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  is because the last time as a country, we tried that on [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=511.36s)]
*  with guys like Gerald L.K. Smith leading the way. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=515.68s)]
*  They were really not shy in saying exactly what they meant by it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=519.0s)]
*  So I'm going to play you a little more Gerald L.K. Smith here. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=522.8s)]
*  I apologize in advance for the annoying music bed coming back, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=525.08s)]

*  Gerald L.K. Smith, the leader of the Christian Nationalist Movement, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=594.56s)]
*  speaking in the 1950s. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=598.04s)]
*  He was the leader of that movement in this country in the World War II era. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=599.7199999999999s)]
*  Around the time he was running for president, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=602.76s)]
*  he was also a leader of that movement in the post-World War II era. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  And I have to tell you what I just played you. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=608.64s)]
*  That's kind of the mild stuff from him. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=610.5999999999999s)]
*  The stuff about the Jews taking over the world [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=613.5999999999999s)]
*  and how Americans need to be Christian nationalists [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=615.92s)]
*  because only that can stop the worldwide Jewish conspiracy, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=618.6s)]
*  not to mention all the race mixing. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=622.72s)]
*  I mean, that sound I just played is the milder version [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=625.4s)]
*  of what Gerald L.K. Smith was famous for. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=628.5600000000001s)]
*  He was a virulent, violent, racist and anti-Semite. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=631.32s)]
*  And that was the core of his movement, Christian nationalism, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=635.76s)]
*  which you'd think would make Christian nationalism [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=640.08s)]
*  kind of a hard thing for today's Republicans to try to raise as their new banner. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=642.6s)]
*  You'd think that would be a hard thing. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=647.64s)]
*  They apparently do not have any qualms, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=649.3199999999999s)]
*  particularly from the Trumpiest members of Congress [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=651.9599999999999s)]
*  and particularly from the Republican nominee for governor [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=654.12s)]
*  in the swing state of Pennsylvania, a man named Doug Mastriano. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=657.56s)]
*  He's been kind of a case study for months now [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=661.0s)]
*  and Republicans actually trying to pull on their best Gerald L.K. Smith masks [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=663.2399999999999s)]

*  A paid consultant for the Doug Mastriano campaign. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=677.68s)]
*  Again, Mastriano is the Republican nominee for governor in Pennsylvania. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=681.0s)]
*  The Republican Party has chosen him as their candidate for governor. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=684.7199999999999s)]

*  Thanks to the Watchdog group, Media Matters, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=691.7199999999999s)]
*  starting to document this guy's own pronouncements [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=694.3199999999999s)]
*  on the threat of the Jews and on the Christian nationalist movement [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=697.52s)]
*  as represented by candidates like his guy, Republican Doug Mastriano. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=703.4s)]
*  Enjoy the fruits of living in a Christian society under Christian laws. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=733.4s)]
*  That is a consultant on the campaign for the Republican nominee [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=741.4s)]
*  for governor in Pennsylvania, Doug Mastriano, clarifying, clarifying [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=744.68s)]
*  that it's not the plan to forcibly deport the Jews. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=749.6s)]
*  Just to be clear, that's not the plan, you know, for now. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=753.76s)]
*  But Jews are not wanted. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=756.4s)]
*  Jews are not part of the movement that this new Republican [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=758.0s)]
*  governor in Pennsylvania represents. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=761.48s)]
*  So Jews, atheists, people of other faith, they won't be forcibly [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=763.9200000000001s)]
*  converted or deported now. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=767.9200000000001s)]
*  That's not the plan for now. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=771.04s)]
*  It's just that this is not for them, nor will this country be. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=772.64s)]
*  When Russia started its war in Ukraine, the first big city they managed to control [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=777.24s)]
*  was the southern city, a southern port city called Kherson. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=780.96s)]
*  Despite fierce Ukrainian resistance in the north and around the Ukrainian [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=785.64s)]
*  capital of Kiev, Russian troops were able to capture Kherson in the south [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=789.92s)]
*  just a week into the war. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=794.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, now it's five months into the war and aided by some new high-powered [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=796.88s)]
*  American weaponry, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is promising a [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=801.4799999999999s)]
*  counteroffensive to retake Kherson, to kick Russian troops out of that whole region. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=805.56s)]
*  President Zelensky said this weekend that Ukrainian troops are advancing [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=810.28s)]
*  step by step that they've liberated 44 towns in the Kherson region so far. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=813.4399999999999s)]
*  They're doing so in part thanks to a new weapon they have just started using, a [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=819.5999999999999s)]
*  weapon called High Mars, short for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=824.3199999999999s)]
*  High Mars are long range, precision guided artillery launchers made in the United [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=830.92s)]
*  States. They've been provided to the Ukrainian military by the United States [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=837.0799999999999s)]
*  government. And basically the way they work is it's pretty understandable, even [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=840.52s)]
*  for those of us in a civilian context. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=845.12s)]
*  This is a launcher that's mounted on a standard US military truck, takes just a [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=847.6s)]
*  four man crew to operate. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=851.84s)]
*  But this thing can fire munitions with a range of about 50 miles, the way they've [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=853.72s)]
*  been equipped and shipped to Ukraine, about a 50 mile range. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=857.32s)]
*  But then importantly, as soon as it has fired its shot, the truck can take off. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=860.6800000000001s)]
*  So the launcher won't be vulnerable to routine fire. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=867.28s)]
*  Within two minutes of a High Mars firing its shot, this truck mounted launcher [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=871.08s)]
*  can be speeding away from the firing location at 60 miles per hour. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=876.16s)]
*  So they can fire at long range in a very precise guided way. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=880.48s)]
*  And then they can get away without having the weapon taken off the battlefield by [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=885.56s)]
*  return fire from the enemy. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=890.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, the Washington Post reported this weekend, quote, the High Mars have been so [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=892.8399999999999s)]
*  effective that the Russian defense ministry has ordered commanders to prioritize [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=895.92s)]
*  them for targeting. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=900.48s)]
*  The US has sent a dozen of these High Mars to Ukraine. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=902.6s)]
*  The administration just said it'll be sending four more for a total of 16. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=905.28s)]
*  It's possible that the Germans and the British are maybe sending a handful more. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=910.76s)]
*  But Ukraine says these weapons are game changing for them and they need a lot more. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=915.04s)]
*  The Ukrainian minister of defense just said, quote, for an effective counteroffensive, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  we need at least a hundred. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=923.9599999999999s)]
*  He said, quote, that would be a game changer. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=925.4s)]
*  It's clear that US provided weapons on the ground in Ukraine are already clear that [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=929.4399999999999s)]
*  US provided weapons already on the ground in Ukraine are doing the work they were [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=933.8s)]
*  intended to do. Ukraine was able to take out a Russian ship on the Black Sea. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=938.08s)]
*  They were eventually able to recapture Snake Island with a US made harpoon missile [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=942.12s)]
*  using these High Mars systems. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=947.8s)]
*  Ukraine was able to destroy an important Russian command center for aerial operations [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=949.3199999999999s)]
*  that they say has drastically resulted in drastically reduced Russian artillery file [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=954.72s)]
*  from over the horizon. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=959.96s)]
*  A congressional delegation that visited Ukraine this weekend also got to see how those [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=962.1600000000001s)]
*  weapons are being used. Among them was Democratic Congresswoman Alyssa Slotkin. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=965.76s)]
*  She has a special connection with Ukraine as her state, Michigan, has a large Ukrainian [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=969.48s)]
*  American population. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=974.1600000000001s)]
*  But her state is also one of the places where soldiers are trained in how to use the High [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=976.0400000000001s)]
*  Mars system. She made a point of that during her visit by giving President Zelensky a [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=979.6s)]
*  challenge coin from a High Mars unit of the Michigan National Guard. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=984.1600000000001s)]
*  Representative Alyssa Slotkin, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=987.88s)]
*  I really appreciate you making the time. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=990.28s)]

*  So you've got an impressive defense and intelligence background, and I'm sure this stuff [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=994.28s)]
*  is easy for you to follow, easy for you to grok in terms of all the jargon and everything. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=998.32s)]
*  But can you explain to our audience why it is that the Ukrainian government and President [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1002.84s)]
*  Zelensky are so interested in this one US weapons system that they have just started to [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1008.44s)]
*  obtain and that does have a connection to your home state of Michigan? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1015.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's basically gives them the ability for precision fires in a [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1020.2s)]
*  way that they just didn't have before. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1026.28s)]
*  You know, you talked about the range, 50 miles. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1028.32s)]
*  I think what's been interesting is that the Russians have backed up that range, right, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1030.56s)]
*  those 50 miles. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1035.04s)]
*  It's pushed them back in a way that I think it's been different. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1036.24s)]
*  And it just brings them a new capability that's longer range, more precise. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1039.84s)]
*  And then those High Mars can move, as you said, it's scoot and shoot or shoot and scoot. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1043.4s)]
*  And they can just get out of where they were. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1047.96s)]
*  And they're very accurate. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1049.8400000000001s)]
*  And so it's just bringing a new capability to them that they haven't had before. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1051.92s)]
*  And they're using to good effect. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1055.76s)]
*  Do you believe that the US is capable of shipping them a lot more? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1058.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't know much about these weapons in terms of what the procurement process is like. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1064.76s)]
*  From what I'm able to read and sort of open source stuff at Steve's, it seems like [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1068.88s)]
*  they're about five million dollars a pop. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1071.72s)]
*  It seems like there are sort of open source estimates that maybe the US has a few hundred [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1073.6000000000001s)]
*  of them in our arsenal, but they've been around for decades. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1077.48s)]
*  They've been around since the 90s. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1080.0s)]
*  It's not like they're a brand new, highly precision weapon that we've only got a [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1081.28s)]
*  handful of. Do you think we're capable of giving them as many more as they want? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1087.2s)]
*  Well, no, not as many more as they want. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1091.56s)]
*  And when you're talking about hundreds upon hundreds, I mean, the planners at the [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1093.32s)]
*  Pentagon have to make sure that we don't cut into bone for US defenses, right, that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  we don't leave ourselves vulnerable. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1101.24s)]
*  We're giving the Ukrainians a lot of different things, including High Mars. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1102.56s)]
*  And so the Pentagon has to make decisions all the time on what can we give them from [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1106.08s)]
*  our inventory? Do other partner nations have similar systems that they can give them? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  I did this with the counter ISIS campaign. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1115.1599999999999s)]
*  It's it's often figuring out what kind of risk you can take. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1117.1599999999999s)]
*  I think there is a question on the table about whether we give them a longer range rocket [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1121.28s)]
*  that goes on the same high Mars. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1126.32s)]
*  It's called an attack. It would be a longer range, 190 miles instead of 50. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1128.28s)]
*  That's something that the Ukrainians asked us for. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1132.96s)]
*  President Zelensky asked us for. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1135.4s)]
*  It's something that I know the administration is having conversations about. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1137.24s)]
*  I'm certainly in support of that. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1140.8000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, it's not any one system that's going to make a counter offensive work, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1142.28s)]
*  particularly in a place like southern Ukraine. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1146.76s)]
*  It's got to be a whole lot of things that come together. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1149.4s)]
*  And it's a complicated thing to go and take back territory when the Russians have [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1152.3600000000001s)]
*  really tried to dig themselves in down south. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1156.8000000000002s)]
*  Congresswoman Alyssa Slotkin, who just returned from Ukraine, including meeting with [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1159.4799999999998s)]
*  President Zelensky, thanks for helping us understand this. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1163.08s)]
*  I feel like Americans do really care about this war. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1166.08s)]
*  Being able to understand the decisions that the American government can make about what [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1168.6799999999998s)]
*  we can do and what we can't is a really important part of staying engaged with the reality [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1172.9599999999998s)]
*  here. Thanks for helping us understand. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1176.7199999999998s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1178.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNiQoUqvsR0&t=1189.12s)]
