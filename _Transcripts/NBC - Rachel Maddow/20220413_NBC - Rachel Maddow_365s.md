# Greatest Threat To Future Of NATO May Be The U.S. Under Trump-Led Republicans
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34)
*  Today, the prime minister in Finland said she expects a decision to be made in her country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=0.0s)]
*  about asking to join NATO, quote, within weeks, not within months. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=3.96s)]
*  Her government presented its security review of the issue to their parliament today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=8.96s)]
*  Their parliament is expected to vote soon to make the NATO ask. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=13.02s)]
*  I mean, bottom line here, if Putin started this war to try to push NATO back from Russia's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=16.8s)]
*  borders, he is accomplishing exactly the opposite. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  He's going to have a lot more NATO on the borders when this is all over. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=24.76s)]
*  Unless, of course, we decide to screw things up. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=28.959999999999997s)]
*  The other NATO countries actually have to vote to allow any new members to join the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=32.8s)]
*  alliance. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  Erin Blake writes in The Washington Post today about the possibility that the country that [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  is perhaps most likely to block that possibility might be us because of our Senate and the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=42.68s)]
*  Republicans within it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=49.04s)]
*  Quote, joining NATO isn't just a matter of Finland and Sweden deciding to become members. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=51.08s)]
*  It is also about whether current members would agree to this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=55.44s)]
*  In the United States, that would require at least two thirds of the U.S. Senate to vote [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=58.2s)]
*  to ratify their membership. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  Exactly how that debate would go down could be quite interesting, especially in light [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=64.44s)]
*  of the Republican Party's slight but significant Trump-era drift into more skepticism of NATO. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  And the looming unknown would be Trump himself weighing in on the process and not necessarily [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=73.56s)]
*  in favor. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=78.30000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Blake points out, quote, that just last week, more than 30 percent of House Republicans [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=79.30000000000001s)]
*  even a symbolic measure reaffirming support for NATO. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=85.28s)]
*  I mean, on the one hand, it would be very unexpected for a NATO member like the U.S. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=88.84s)]
*  to block new countries joining the alliance. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  On the other hand, given the parties involved and given the weird Trumpy feelings about [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=98.04s)]
*  Putin in the Republican Party now, maybe this is a real thing to worry about. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=102.6s)]
*  Joining us now is Washington Post senior political reporter who wrote that piece for The Washington [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=109.0s)]
*  Post, Aaron Blake. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=112.76s)]
*  Mr. Blake, it's nice to see you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for making time to be here tonight. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=115.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  I have oversimplified this a little bit, I acknowledge. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=119.68s)]
*  But let me just ask you to correct me if I've got any of the basic points wrong here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  You're basically raising the prospect that because of internal Republican Party dynamics [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=128.16s)]
*  and ideological shifts within the Republican Party, particularly in the Trump era, they [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=132.96s)]
*  might not vote to let these two new countries join NATO. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=137.56s)]
*  Look, I think the conventional wisdom is that Republicans and Congress more broadly would [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=142.48s)]
*  sign off on this on a pretty bipartisan basis. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=147.12s)]
*  But also remember, this is something that requires two thirds majorities in the Senate. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=149.88s)]
*  This has been a consensus issue in the past. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=155.42s)]
*  In 2003, 2004, it was actually unanimous when there were seven countries joining. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=157.88s)]
*  In 1999, 98, it was an overwhelming vote, 80 to 19. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  But that was an interesting one, because while it wound up being a very significant majority [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=167.22s)]
*  in favor, there were concerns about this being provocative to Russia. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=171.96s)]
*  And those were bipartisan concerns. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=176.24s)]
*  So I think if you overlay that on some of this shift away from NATO and away from foreign [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=178.24s)]
*  alliances in the Republican Party, you layer on top of that a president who has wrecked [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  shop in NATO to some degree, has called into question that alliance. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=187.96s)]
*  And according to his own advisers considered pulling out of it in a second term, I think [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  there really is a law of unintended consequences when it comes to how this might play out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=196.52s)]
*  Even if that might not ultimately mean that this is in any real danger of failing in the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=202.02s)]
*  U.S. Senate. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=207.06s)]
*  It was interesting, and I think it was important that you noted that just last week there was [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=209.22s)]
*  that vote, again, a symbolic resolution expressing support for NATO, where we had 30 percent [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=213.02s)]
*  of the House Republican caucus vote no on that, even though it wasn't binding, even [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=219.48s)]
*  though it wasn't going to actually effectuate anything in the real world, simply to show [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=224.4s)]
*  effectively the spirit of the United States in supporting this alliance when it's under [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=228.74s)]
*  as they stand united against the the the Russian invasion. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=233.86s)]
*  Did you hear around that vote new arguments or new rationale from Republicans in terms [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=238.02s)]
*  of why they might not stand with NATO even for a vote like that? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=245.5s)]
*  Well, a lot of it, there weren't a whole lot of explanations that came out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=250.22s)]
*  You did see some of the more long established NATO critics basically saying that they don't [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  like the idea of being too beholden to this alliance. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=259.94s)]
*  I think what struck me, though, from some of the other reactions that I saw from more [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=264.14s)]
*  rank and file members, Freedom Caucus types, was the idea that this commitment shouldn't [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=268.06s)]
*  be open ended, that this should not be something where we should be unequivocal in our [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=273.14s)]
*  continued support for NATO. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=277.7s)]
*  And so I think that's where we start to get into these issues of if this really comes to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=279.18s)]
*  a head, if you see the leader of the Republican Party not necessarily opposing Finland and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=283.9s)]
*  Sweden joining the alliance, but maybe casting things in a in a more ambivalent way like [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=288.97999999999996s)]
*  he has in the past when it comes to Ukraine joining NATO in 2015, he was very noncommittal [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=294.58s)]
*  about that. It really is a situation in which there is going to be pressure on some of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=299.7s)]
*  these Republicans to toe that more NATO skeptical line. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=305.7s)]
*  And it may not manifest itself as much in the Senate, where there's been some more [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=308.9s)]
*  independence of Trump from Senate Republicans. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=312.62s)]
*  But I think the party as a whole would be forced into some kind of uncomfortable conversations if [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=315.58s)]
*  their leader isn't going to come on board and endorse this kind of thing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=320.3s)]
*  And I think that's very much an open question. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=323.1s)]
*  Yeah, if their leader isn't going to come on board and if he's willing to not just be NATO [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=325.62s)]
*  skeptical, but to be pro-Putin in his analysis of it, as he has been in the past, hopefully [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=330.06s)]
*  there's a higher political cost for that now. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=334.82s)]
*  But we'll know when we get there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=337.74s)]
*  Aaron Blake, senior political reporter for The Washington Post, appreciate your analysis, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  appreciate your time here tonight. Thank you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=342.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVT11FDNw34&t=344.58s)]
