# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: July 18
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g)
*  This is a document that we have just obtained that has not been published elsewhere. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=0.0s)]
*  It is from Attorney General Merrick Garland. It is addressed to all Justice Department employees. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=3.68s)]
*  It is dated May 25th, 2022. So that's about eight weeks ago. But again, we believe the first time [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  this document has been shown to the public. As you can see, it is titled, Election Year Sensitivities. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=15.36s)]
*  Department of Justice employees are entrusted with the authority to enforce the laws of the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=22.72s)]
*  United States and with a responsibility to do so in a neutral and impartial manner. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=26.56s)]
*  This is particularly important in an election year now that the 2022 election season is upon us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=31.04s)]
*  And as in prior election cycles, I am issuing this memorandum to remind you of the department's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=36.48s)]
*  existing policies with respect to political activities. And again, this is a memo that is [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=41.36s)]
*  from Attorney General Merrick Garland. It has his signature on the top of it in blue ink. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=45.92s)]
*  And then it says this under the heading, Statements, Investigations and Charging Near [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=52.0s)]
*  an Election. Quote, the Department of Justice has a strong interest in the prosecution of election [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=56.0s)]
*  related crimes, such as those involving federal and state campaign finance laws, federal patronage [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=60.64s)]
*  laws, corruption of the election process. As department employees, however, we must be [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=65.2s)]
*  particularly sensitive to safeguarding the department's reputation for fairness, neutrality, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=69.84s)]
*  and nonpartisanship. Simply put, partisan politics must play no role in the decisions of federal [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=74.64s)]
*  investigators or prosecutors regarding any investigations or criminal charges. Law [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=79.92s)]
*  enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of public statements, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  attributed or not, meaning on background or not. Investigative steps, criminal charges, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=90.16s)]
*  or any other action in any matter or case for the purpose of affecting any election or for the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party. Such a purpose [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=100.08s)]
*  or the appearance of such a purpose is inconsistent with the department's mission and with the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=104.88s)]
*  principles of federal prosecution. If you face an issue or the appearance of an issue regarding the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=109.28s)]
*  timing of statements, investigative steps, charges, or other actions near the time of a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=113.92s)]
*  primary or general election, contact the public integrity section of the criminal division for [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=118.8s)]
*  further guidance. Such consultation is also required at various stages of all criminal matters [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=123.44s)]
*  that focus on violations of federal and state campaign finance laws, federal patronage crimes, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=129.12s)]
*  and corruption of the election process. And now get this. Finally, department employees must also [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=133.76s)]
*  adhere to the additional requirements issued by the attorney general on February 5th, 2020. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=141.84s)]
*  February 5th, 2020. Governing the opening of criminal and counterintelligence investigations [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=148.8s)]
*  by the department, including its law enforcement agencies related to politically sensitive [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=154.32s)]
*  individuals and entities. See memorandum of Attorney General William Barr, February 5th, 2020. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=158.8s)]
*  Any questions regarding the scope or requirements of the February 2020 attorney [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  general's memorandum should be directed to the public integrity section. Again, this memo from [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=169.84s)]
*  Merrick Garland to the Justice Department, to all Justice Department employees was sent out about [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=177.12s)]
*  eight weeks ago in late May. We have just obtained it. We believe this is the first time it's been [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=181.76s)]
*  made public. And in large part, this memo from the attorney general follows both the letter and the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=185.12s)]
*  spirit of previous letters from other attorneys general around election time. Basically says, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=192.56s)]
*  look, we can't look like we're acting to effectuate some particular partisan outcome around [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=198.88s)]
*  election time. That means we may delay certain steps we would otherwise take in order to avoid [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  even the perception that we are trying to influence election outcomes. We have seen that kind of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=210.64s)]
*  guidance before from attorneys general of all stripes. That's fine. That's at least non-controversial. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=216.16s)]
*  But this last part about Bill Barr's instructions from 2020, that's kind of a surprise. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=220.48s)]
*  February 2020, Trump Attorney General Bill Barr put out new guidance over and above what all [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=230.0s)]
*  attorneys general had previously said. And what Bill Barr said in February 2020 was specifically [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=235.12s)]
*  that, in essence, nobody's allowed to investigate anybody connected to a presidential candidate [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  without his permission personally as attorney general. Barr's memo from February 2020, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  the language of it specifically, it said, quote, no investigation, including any preliminary [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=253.84s)]
*  investigation, may be opened or initiated by the department or any of its law enforcement agencies [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=258.24s)]
*  of a declared candidate for president or vice president, a presidential campaign, or a senior [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=263.36s)]
*  presidential campaign staff member or advisor absent prior written approval of the attorney [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=268.0s)]
*  general through the deputy attorney general. Trump Attorney General Bill Barr established that new [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=273.44s)]
*  rule in February 2020, no investigating any declared candidate for president or anybody working for [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  that candidate unless I personally give my permission. That new rule was established by [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=287.52s)]
*  Bill Barr when he was working for Donald Trump. Merrick Garland has just formally extended that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=293.84s)]
*  guidance and told every employee of the Justice Department that it is still in effect. Notice went [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=300.48s)]
*  out in late May, we are reporting the memo here, making it publicly available for the first time. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=305.68s)]
*  Well, what's happened in the meantime since that guidance went out from Merrick Garland [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  to every Justice Department employee telling them that the Bill Barr advice is still in effect [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=319.12s)]
*  and any investigation, including the opening of any investigation that applies to a candidate for [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=324.0s)]
*  president or anybody working for a candidate for president that has to get his personal sign off. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=329.36s)]
*  What has happened since late May when this went out? Well, former president Donald Trump has had [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  the delightful experience of the January 6 investigation, essentially rolling out a real [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=338.8s)]
*  time prime time criminal referral of him to the Justice Department. Justice Department, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=344.48s)]
*  which is poking along with its own cases at its own pace, may be more interested in the fake [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=351.36s)]
*  electors part specifically, maybe just spending a lot of time watching the January 6 investigators [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=355.68s)]
*  marveling at all the neat stuff they've turned up that the Justice Department is apparently [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=360.88s)]
*  learning about the same time we all are by watching the hearings. That's happened since [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=365.76s)]
*  this memo went out. And also since this memo went out, Trump has responded to all these revelations [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  about him in January 6th by reportedly moving to speed up his own declaration that he's going to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=378.24s)]
*  be a candidate for president again. And that of course is despite the interests of the Republican [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=383.84s)]
*  Party, which will likely not be helped at all by him telling the country formally that he intends [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=388.56s)]
*  to lead the Republican Party again right before people have to decide this fall whether to put [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  Republicans in power in Congress. It wouldn't be good for the Republican Party if Trump announces [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  he's a candidate for president again before the midterm elections happen. Wouldn't be good for [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=402.96s)]
*  his party, but it would be very much in keeping with his own interest and putting as many roadblocks [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  as possible in the way of any possible prosecution of himself. Jennifer Rubin writing at the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=411.76s)]
*  Washington Post today said, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=418.4s)]
*  Fair enough. January 6th Investigation Chairman Benny Thompson was just asked about this tonight. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=419.92s)]
*  Former president announcing another presidential run. He's clearly toying with doing it at some [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  point. What impact does that have on your investigation? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=455.68s)]
*  Two years before the election. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  I would say no. Even I don't know what the doctor even if [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=466.88s)]
*  he chooses because he's running for president. So Donald Trump is just like every other American [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  citizen in this situation. Yes, it would be unorthodox for him to announce two years in [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=505.84s)]
*  advance that he's a candidate for president. Why would he do that? Well, now we know now that we've [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  obtained this Justice Department memo from a few weeks ago. Now we know for sure that it does kick [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  something into action. If he in fact announces himself as a declared candidate for president, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=521.28s)]
*  that means any investigation that relates to him or anyone working for him has to be personally [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=525.68s)]
*  cleared in writing through the very highest echelons of the Justice Department. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=530.08s)]
*  He told his kids back home in Texas that yes, he had participated in the attack and yes, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  he definitely had had a loaded gun with him during the entire thing. He also then threatened to kill [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=540.64s)]
*  his kids if they told anyone. He told his 18 year old son and his 16 year old daughter, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=547.44s)]
*  quote, If you turn me in, you're a traitor and traitors get shot. The sun that same day, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  the day that his dad threatened to kill him, met with an FBI agent, told him what he knew about [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=559.68s)]
*  his father's activities on January 6th and gave him something. When the dad had told his son and [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=564.4799999999999s)]
*  daughter about having his loaded gun with him at the Capitol during the attack, turns out the son [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=570.9599999999999s)]
*  had been recording that conversation. And that day when he met with the FBI agent, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=576.2399999999999s)]
*  he gave the recording to the FBI. And so that kid's dad, that was the first man who was put on trial [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  for his role in the January 6th attack. He's a man from Wiley, Texas. His name is Guy Riffett. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=588.56s)]
*  The attack on the Capitol building was January 2021. He was the first one put on trial. He was [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=594.88s)]
*  put on trial in March 2021. He was charged with five felonies. Arm trespassing, found guilty. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=599.1199999999999s)]
*  Obstruction of an official proceeding, found guilty. Interfering with police in a riot, guilty. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=606.2399999999999s)]
*  Transporting a firearm for the purposes of interfering with police in a riot, also guilty. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=611.5999999999999s)]
*  And the fifth felony he was charged with was witness tampering. He was also found guilty of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  that. Witness tampering, of course, for threatening to kill his own teenage son and daughter if they [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=622.0s)]
*  told anyone what he had done. It emerged during Guy Riffett's trial that he was actually doubly [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  armed in D.C. that day. He had an AR-15 assault rifle with him when he went to Washington. He [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=634.3199999999999s)]
*  apparently left that in the garage of his D.C. hotel on the day of the actual Capitol attack. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=639.3599999999999s)]
*  But his loaded semi-automatic Smith & Wesson pistol, that one he had holstered on his hip [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=644.64s)]
*  the whole time while he led the pro-Trump mob in attacking police officers at the wing doors of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=650.48s)]
*  the U.S. Senate. He also had flex cuffs with him, police-style heavy-duty zip ties, because he [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=656.24s)]
*  planned on tying people up. He recorded video of himself talking about how he was looking forward [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=663.52s)]
*  to dragging members of Congress out of a Capitol building, quote, kicking and screaming. Guy Riffett [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  is part of a pro-Trump armed paramilitary group called the Three Percenters. That's a group that [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=675.04s)]
*  was reportedly well represented in Washington during the attack. It's also a group that has [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=680.4799999999999s)]
*  surfaced in other instances of physical intimidation against people Trump has targeted, people like [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=684.64s)]
*  Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers. It is now time for the court to hand down his sentence. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  Now, his defense lawyers have asked him, have asked the judge to give Guy Riffett less than [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=694.4799999999999s)]
*  two years in prison. Who knows? Federal sentencing guidelines suggest a term of more like nine to [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=700.24s)]
*  11 years in prison. But this is interesting, and this provides us some new insight. The federal [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  prosecutors in the Guy Riffett case have now asked the judge for something called an upward departure [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=714.88s)]
*  from the sentencing guidelines. Again, sentencing guidelines are for like nine to 11 years. They're [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=720.24s)]
*  asking for the court to consider a longer sentence than that. They're asking the court to consider [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=725.76s)]
*  adding a sentencing enhancement in his case on the grounds of terrorism, on the grounds that what he [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=730.64s)]
*  did fits the statutory definition of terrorism. Quote, Riffett engaged in acts of violence that [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=737.68s)]
*  were intended to influence the government through intimidation or coercion, acts that have been [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=744.56s)]
*  defined by statute as domestic terrorism. Now, it is up to the courts, up to the judge whether or not [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=749.52s)]
*  to actually do that to accept this terrorism enhancement on Guy Riffett's sentence. But if the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=756.4s)]
*  judge does agree to prosecutors request on that, the practical consequence is steep. And the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=761.76s)]
*  practical consequence is that prosecutors are saying this guy should get 15 years in prison. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=767.84s)]
*  For context, that would be roughly triple the sentence that anybody else has received so far [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=772.88s)]
*  for their role in the capital attack. And that incident, that handling of that one case tells us [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=778.08s)]
*  a couple of things. First, it tells us that the U.S. Justice Department has concluded that it's [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=783.84s)]
*  okay to treat the January 6th attack as terrorism, as domestic terrorism. They have concluded at the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=787.2800000000001s)]
*  Justice Department that in some cases the perpetrators of that attack should be prosecuted as terrorists. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=794.0s)]
*  And that should go off like the rocket's red glare to the 300 plus other defendants who are [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  still waiting to go on trial on charges related to January 6th. In Wisconsin, a woman had an [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=806.0s)]
*  incomplete miscarriage. She bled for more than 10 days after emergency room staff would not remove [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=813.04s)]
*  the fetal tissue from her uterus. They were afraid they could be prosecuted if they did so [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=819.28s)]
*  under a law banning abortion that is now in effect in Wisconsin. Doctors at a hospital in Michigan [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=824.08s)]
*  found themselves treating a woman from out of state. She had had to cross state lines to get [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=830.0s)]
*  care for a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy is never viable. Doctors say [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=833.92s)]
*  that it could have caused a rupture at any moment that could have killed this woman, but a doctor in [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=841.04s)]
*  her home state worried that the presence of a fetal heartbeat made a procedure to remove it [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=844.8s)]
*  illegal and wouldn't do it even though it risked her life. In Louisiana, a doctor described treating [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=850.0s)]
*  a patient whose water broke at 16 weeks. The fetus was not viable. Continuing the pregnancy at that [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=856.24s)]
*  point would put the woman's life at risk. The patient wanted her doctor to perform a common [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=861.28s)]
*  15-minute abortion procedure, but the patient was told that under Louisiana's new law outlawing [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=865.8399999999999s)]
*  abortion, she would have to have an induced delivery instead. In an affidavit filed in court, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=871.6s)]
*  the doctor said her patient, quote, was forced to go through a painful hours-long labor to deliver [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=876.8s)]
*  a non-viable fetus despite her wishes and best medical advice. Quote, she was screaming not from [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=883.1999999999999s)]
*  pain, but from the emotional trauma she was experiencing. And then she hemorrhaged nearly [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=889.52s)]
*  a liter of blood. The doctor said, quote, there is absolutely no medical basis for my patient or any [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=895.04s)]
*  other patient in the state to experience anything like this. This was the first time in my 15-year [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=900.48s)]
*  career I could not give a patient the care they needed. This is a travesty. One OB-GYN in Texas [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=904.96s)]
*  described a recent patient who had started to miscarry and developed a dangerous infection in [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=912.56s)]
*  her womb. The fetus still had signs of a heartbeat, though, so an immediate abortion, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=917.76s)]
*  which would be the usual standard of care, that would have been illegal under Texas' abortion ban. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=922.72s)]
*  The doctor said, quote, we physically watched her get sicker and sicker and sicker until the [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=927.76s)]
*  fetal heartbeat stopped the next day and then we could intervene. The patient developed complications, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=932.48s)]
*  required surgery, lost multiple liters of blood, and had to be put on a breathing machine, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=937.76s)]
*  all because we were essentially 24 hours behind. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=943.68s)]
*  Those are just a handful of the stories that doctors have been willing to put on the record [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=948.24s)]
*  about the practical consequences all over the country of the Supreme Court overturning the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=952.0s)]
*  right to an abortion. It is not theoretical. It is happening now. We are already seeing mass chaos [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=956.72s)]
*  among OB-GYNs, emergency room physicians, and quite frankly, pharmacists. OB-GYNs who are sitting on [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=962.88s)]
*  patients in emergency rooms while they bleed, while their vital signs become unstable, while [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=969.52s)]
*  they're waiting for hospital lawyers to decide, is this patient sick enough? That is Dr. Colleen [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=974.64s)]
*  McNicholas. She's an OB-GYN who practices in Missouri and Illinois. Joining us now is Dr. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=980.88s)]
*  Colleen McNicholas. She's Chief Medical Officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region in [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=985.92s)]
*  southwest Missouri. Dr. McNicholas, it's nice to see you. Thanks very much for making time to be [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=989.68s)]
*  here. Thanks so much, Rachel. Happy to be here. So in Missouri, one of the places you practice, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=993.84s)]
*  abortion is now illegal except in medical emergencies that cause irreversible physical [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1000.88s)]
*  impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman. You said that standard in Missouri [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1006.4s)]
*  is basically causing mass chaos at a practical level in terms of what care doctors can provide [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1012.3199999999999s)]
*  and what women have to go through. Is anything resolving over time? Is anything becoming more [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1017.28s)]
*  clear? You know, we've heard you open with lots of stories from not just Missouri, but from across [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1022.0s)]
*  the country where physicians are really struggling because this medical emergency exception is [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1029.04s)]
*  totally unworkable. Folks are not practicing the best medicine because they're afraid of going to [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1035.36s)]
*  prison. In terms of what remedies are available here, I was curious when you talked about hospitals [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1042.0s)]
*  lawyers and health systems lawyers, particularly big hospitals, big legal departments, big [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1051.28s)]
*  institutions that are considering issues like this, could they be taking a more proactive [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1057.76s)]
*  stance on this? Instead of telling doctors to wait for a patient to be sick enough, could they say, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1062.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, give your best care and if they come after you, if it comes to it, we will defend you? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1069.12s)]
*  Is there a way to be more forward leaning on this, particularly doctors who have more [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1075.04s)]
*  institutional support than people who are operating in private or small practices? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1079.92s)]
*  You know, sure, it's always great to have the support of your institution and the lawyers there, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1085.28s)]
*  but the truth is if you live in a state with an aggressive and rabidly anti-choice attorney general, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1090.96s)]
*  no reassurance from your hospital or from your hospital legal system or lawyers is going to make [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1097.04s)]
*  you feel comfortable enough to continue to provide that care when the reality is, is that it's a [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1102.5600000000002s)]
*  criminal penalty to violate this law. And so it's just totally unworkable and has led to, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1108.88s)]
*  as I said in the hearing, total chaos among a group of healthcare professionals who went in this [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1116.5600000000002s)]
*  to heal people and not to have to sit there and wait for other lawyers or attorney generals to [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1122.5600000000002s)]
*  tell them it's okay to proceed. And you told that hearing last week that you wanted Congress to use [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1129.2s)]
*  every bit of your power to do something. What do you think they could do given what the [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1135.52s)]
*  Supreme Court has has undone? You know, we've seen a good step in the statement around enforcement of [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1139.92s)]
*  EMTALA, the emergency medical clause that does say that hospitals and physicians when presented [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1148.24s)]
*  with a patient in an emergency situation must be treated. But the truth is that's only going to [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1154.56s)]
*  affect the small minority of folks who need abortion care. We need the administration and [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1160.32s)]
*  we need folks not just at the federal level, but at the state level and states where there is [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1164.88s)]
*  opportunity to further protect access to do so, to allocate funds and resources for patients who are [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1169.44s)]
*  needing to get that care, to provide safety and security for patients crossing state lines to get [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1176.0800000000002s)]
*  that care. We really need a whole of government and truthfully a whole of medicine response to [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1182.0s)]
*  this public health emergency. Dr. Colleen McNiglas, Chief Medical Officer of Planned Parenthood of the [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=481cbC1281g&t=1187.3600000000001s)]
