# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: May 13
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U)
*  Big night, you guys. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=0.0s)]
*  Today's proceedings, unexpectedly to me, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1.84s)]
*  were like that helpful moment in the old Agatha Christie-style [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=6.48s)]
*  British detective story. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=10.72s)]
*  You've been following along more or less. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=12.44s)]
*  You know who most of the characters are. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=14.64s)]
*  You can at least remember most of their names. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=16.6s)]
*  You know the basic plot of this mystery. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=20.2s)]
*  But then there is this kindness, this great helpful moment [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=23.2s)]
*  in the story where the detective sits down [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=27.56s)]
*  under some stupid pretense with some other character. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  And in their conversation, they give you all the answers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=34.4s)]
*  It's OK you haven't been paying close attention all along. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=38.04s)]
*  They, in this conversation, are going [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=41.32s)]
*  to recap the whole story. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=43.08s)]
*  And not only will they get to the big answer, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=45.04s)]
*  the big whodunit, they will also give you [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  the solutions to all the other little mysteries [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=50.04s)]
*  and red herrings that popped up over the course of the story. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=53.04s)]
*  That was Michael Agatha Christie Cohen today. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=57.32s)]
*  So for example, why did Michael Cohen [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=61.56s)]
*  make the hush money payments to Stormy Daniels [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=64.68s)]
*  from his home equity line of credit [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=67.16s)]
*  rather than from, I don't know, his bank account? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=69.68s)]
*  Ah, we learned today it's because that account was paperless. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=73.2s)]
*  No statements related to that home equity line of credit [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  were going to be mailed to his house. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  So Michael Cohen's wife was never [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=83.56s)]
*  going to see some inexplicable $130,000 payment on a statement [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=85.64s)]
*  and question him as to what he was up to. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=90.52s)]
*  Now we know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=93.2s)]
*  Also, why, when the reimbursement [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=94.52s)]
*  was made to Michael Cohen for him paying for Stormy Daniels' [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=97.32s)]
*  hush money, why did that include not just the Stormy Daniels [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=100.48s)]
*  reimbursement, but a bunch of money [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  for a bunch of other things? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=107.04s)]
*  Well, we learned today that this was [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=109.4s)]
*  going to be the last money Michael Cohen ever received [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=112.72s)]
*  from the Trump Organization. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=115.64s)]
*  In these payments, they included everything he was owed. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=118.0s)]
*  They were zeroing him out. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=121.48s)]
*  He was leaving the company. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  And why was he doing that? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=124.4s)]
*  Because if Michael Cohen was still a Trump Organization [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=125.76s)]
*  employee like he had been, it wouldn't make sense for him [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=129.44s)]
*  to be getting checks as a retainer for legal services. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=132.56s)]
*  He would just be getting a salary [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=136.72s)]
*  like he had been for years before. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=138.16s)]
*  So instead, Cohen leaves the Trump Organization, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=140.64s)]
*  becomes the personal attorney to the president, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=144.04s)]
*  which makes the legal retainer checks look [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=147.76s)]
*  like that was how Trump was paying for Cohen's services [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=150.0s)]
*  as his personal attorney. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=152.72s)]
*  In reality, Cohen was never paid anything [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=155.0s)]
*  for being personal attorney to the president. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=158.28s)]
*  That's just what they called it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=160.76s)]
*  That's just what they called him so it wouldn't look so weird [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=162.28s)]
*  that Trump was paying him $35,000 checks every month. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  Oh, now that makes sense. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=169.52s)]
*  Also, why did prosecutors go out of their way [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=171.56s)]
*  to point out that Ben Roethlisberger, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=174.24s)]
*  the former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=176.84s)]
*  had been at the golf event with Donald Trump [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  at the time of the Trump Stormy Daniels sex, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  alleged sexual encounter? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=186.28s)]
*  Now we know. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=188.88s)]
*  Contrary to Trump's denials [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=190.52s)]
*  that he had sex with Stormy Daniels, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=192.4s)]
*  Michael Cohen testified today that when he asked Donald Trump [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  if anything had happened between him and Stormy Daniels, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=198.24s)]
*  Trump bragged to Michael Cohen that, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=201.4s)]
*  yeah, even though he was there at this golf event [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=204.52s)]
*  with Big Ben Roethlisberger, the women there, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  like Stormy Daniels, they wanted him [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  more than they wanted Big Ben. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=214.44s)]
*  All the little mysteries that have popped up [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=219.84s)]
*  over the course of us learning about this scandal, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  all the little mysteries that have popped up [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=226.2s)]
*  are inexplicable sort of sidebars and detours [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=228.56s)]
*  that we didn't necessarily understand [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=231.6s)]
*  as the prosecution has laid out its case thus far. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=234.04s)]
*  Michael Cohen today provided the all-is-revealed scene [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=236.88s)]
*  in this detective story, tying up the loose ends, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=241.68s)]
*  filling in the gaps in the story, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=244.6s)]
*  and yes, bringing us to the main event, the big whodunit. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=247.0s)]
*  Michael Cohen, longtime lawyer, enforcer, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=251.88s)]
*  bully, quote-unquote, fixer for former President Donald Trump, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=256.52s)]
*  the man who, in the mob analogy, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=260.88s)]
*  was not so much the hit man as he was the underboss, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=262.84s)]
*  the man who testified today about, for example, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=265.84s)]
*  telling suppliers and contractors and vendors [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=268.28s)]
*  to Trump University that they would get 20% [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=270.48s)]
*  of what they invoiced Trump University for [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=273.68s)]
*  or they'd get nothing and they'd like it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  Michael Cohen gave testimony today [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=279.28s)]
*  that Donald Trump was in the room where it happened, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  in the worst possible way. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=286.2s)]
*  The one piece of paper that has emerged in this case [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=289.52s)]
*  that is the most important piece of paper of all is this one. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=292.44s)]
*  This document, People's Exhibit 35, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=296.67999999999995s)]
*  is the smoking gun document [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=299.4s)]
*  in this first-ever criminal trial of an American president. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  It is a bank statement showing the wire transfer [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=304.52s)]
*  of $130,000 to the representative for Stormy Daniels. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  It's the bank record showing that the hush money payment [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=312.8s)]
*  was, in fact, made. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=316.32000000000005s)]
*  And on the bottom of the bank statement, on the right, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=317.92s)]
*  you see what we now know is Michael Cohen's handwriting, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=320.56s)]
*  showing something else he wants to be reimbursed for. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=323.6s)]
*  Since we now understand he's leaving the Trump Organization, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  at this point, he wants to make sure, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  in this last payment that's coming to him, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=332.32000000000005s)]
*  this other money the Trump Organization owes him [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  is going to be included. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=336.88s)]
*  That's on the bottom right side of this piece of paper. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=338.36s)]
*  On the bottom left side of this piece of paper, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=341.64s)]
*  you see different handwriting. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=344.8s)]
*  This is handwriting from the Trump Organization's [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=346.28s)]
*  CFO, Allen Weisselberg. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=348.24s)]
*  And it's him doing the math. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=350.24s)]
*  This is how much Michael Cohen is owed. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=353.0s)]
*  Since we're gonna lie and say this is income for him [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=355.12s)]
*  instead of the reimbursement that it actually is, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=359.08s)]
*  that means he's gonna have to pay taxes on it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=361.8s)]
*  So here's how much we'll add to what we're paying him [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  to account for the taxes he's gonna have to pay. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=367.12s)]
*  Here's the add additional bonus line [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=369.36s)]
*  because he said he was owed money on his annual bonus [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  and he's never getting another one [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=374.68s)]
*  because he's leaving the organization. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=375.8s)]
*  Here's the over 12s part at the bottom there. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  That means we're gonna pay it over 12 months. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=380.32000000000005s)]
*  So it's $420,000 over 12 months. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  That's $35,000 a month. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=384.92s)]
*  That's Allen Weisselberg doing the math. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=386.36s)]
*  That document, People's Exhibit 35, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  what prosecutors have laid out [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=391.68s)]
*  is that that is the smoking gun document [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=393.08s)]
*  that shows the crime. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=395.52s)]
*  It shows what the payment was really for [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  and how it was disguised as something else [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=401.4s)]
*  in the business records of the Trump organization. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=404.35999999999996s)]
*  And it was disguised as something else [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=406.96s)]
*  in order to conceal its true nature [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=408.76s)]
*  because its true nature was that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=410.64s)]
*  it was a campaign expenditure. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  That's the prosecution's case. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  That document shows the crime. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=416.68s)]
*  And we have seen this document before in this trial. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=419.76s)]
*  But today, Michael Cohen testified for the first time [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  that Trump was there for it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  That he, Michael Cohen and Allen Weisselberg, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=430.32s)]
*  the Trump CFO, talked it over during which time [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=433.24s)]
*  they made those notes on that piece of paper. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=437.08s)]
*  That's why there's two different sets of handwriting [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=440.0s)]
*  on that piece of paper. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=442.35999999999996s)]
*  After the two of them marked up that piece of paper [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=443.76s)]
*  the way I just described, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=446.59999999999997s)]
*  they then took that piece of paper [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=447.96s)]
*  and marched it down to Donald Trump's office [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=450.28s)]
*  on the 26th floor of Trump Tower. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=452.59999999999997s)]
*  And with that paper in hand, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=454.4s)]
*  the three of them had a discussion [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=456.96s)]
*  about what exactly they were doing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=458.79999999999995s)]
*  and why they were doing it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=461.12s)]
*  And he said, do it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=462.79999999999995s)]
*  Prosecutor, following the meeting with Mr. Weisselberg [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=466.2s)]
*  and both of you adding that handwriting [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  to People's Exhibit 35, what did you do [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=470.56s)]
*  and where did the two of you go at that time? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=473.12s)]
*  Answer. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=475.12s)]
*  We went to Mr. Trump's office [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=476.12s)]
*  in order to speak to him about this. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=477.4s)]
*  Question. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=479.04s)]
*  Now, when was this approximately? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=479.88s)]
*  Answer. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=481.44s)]

*  Question. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=485.4s)]
*  So he was still at Trump Tower at that time? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=486.24s)]
*  Answer. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=488.68s)]
*  What did you understand he was engaged in [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=489.5s)]
*  at Trump Tower at that time? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=490.88s)]
*  Answer. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=492.44s)]
*  Being president-elect. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=493.76s)]
*  Was he at meetings at Trump Tower? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=495.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=497.52s)]
*  Now, what happened when you went into Mr. Trump's office [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=498.44s)]
*  to have this discussion with him? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=500.52s)]
*  During the conversation, Allen turned around [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  and said to me, hmm, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=504.16s)]
*  while we were talking about this, it was, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  and what we're gonna do is [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  we're gonna pay you over 12 months. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=508.76s)]
*  I think the indication here from the transcript [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=511.40000000000003s)]
*  is that Cohen then sort of rebutted that. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=513.12s)]
*  It was probably better if I get it in one lump sum. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=515.8000000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=519.4s)]
*  Why don't you do it as over 12 months [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=520.78s)]
*  and it will be paid out to you monthly? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  Question. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=525.48s)]
*  And did he say anything about how it would be paid out [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=526.32s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  As like a legal service rendered [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=531.4s)]
*  since I was then being given the title [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=533.28s)]
*  as personal attorney to the president. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=536.26s)]

*  Because they always played that sort of game [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=619.54s)]
*  of fricking frack type game. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=621.3s)]
*  And I didn't, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=623.02s)]
*  I had been around that office more than enough [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=624.82s)]
*  to realize that this conversation [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=625.86s)]
*  had already taken place between the two. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=627.34s)]

*  Trump defense counsel, Todd Blanch, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=635.62s)]
*  your honor, objection to that answer [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=637.1s)]
*  and move to strike. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=638.86s)]
*  The judge overruled, overruled. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=639.9000000000001s)]
*  Question. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=643.4200000000001s)]
*  And when Allen Weisselberg laid out the plan [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=644.24s)]
*  of how much you were going to get paid [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=646.1400000000001s)]
*  and over what months and showed Mr. Trump this document, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=647.9000000000001s)]
*  did Mr. Trump try to renegotiate? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=650.82s)]
*  Answer. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=653.9000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=654.74s)]
*  So he approved it at that point. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=655.5600000000001s)]
*  Answer. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=656.9000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=657.74s)]
*  Now at some point, did Mr. Trump confirm to you [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=658.7800000000001s)]
*  that he was going to give you the title [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=660.74s)]
*  of personal attorney or personal counsel to the president? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=662.0200000000001s)]
*  Answer. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=664.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=665.3000000000001s)]
*  When in relation to this meeting was that? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=666.12s)]
*  Answer. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=667.7600000000001s)]
*  Around this same exact time. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=668.6s)]
*  And it was the $420,000 that you were going to receive [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=670.7s)]
*  back from Mr. Trump going to be payment [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=674.32s)]
*  for future legal services as personal counsel? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=676.3000000000001s)]
*  Answer. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=680.38s)]
*  That was what it was designed to be. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=681.26s)]
*  Well, what was it actually? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=684.62s)]
*  Answer. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  Reimbursement of my money. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=687.64s)]
*  Question. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=689.94s)]
*  It was repayment of which monies? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=690.9s)]
*  Answer. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=693.82s)]
*  It was a repayment of the Stormy Daniels payment. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=694.6600000000001s)]
*  Question. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=698.02s)]
*  Now you said that you believe this occurred at Trump Tower [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=698.84s)]
*  some days before Mr. Trump actually left for Washington. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=700.86s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=703.46s)]
*  Answer. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=704.38s)]
*  Correct. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=705.22s)]
*  Did Mr. Reiselberg have within this document [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=706.12s)]
*  People's Exhibit 35? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=711.28s)]
*  He did. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=712.56s)]
*  Did he show this document to Mr. Trump? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=713.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=714.9599999999999s)]
*  Michael Cohen testifying today for the first time [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=716.52s)]
*  that just before leaving to be inaugurated [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=720.26s)]
*  as president of the United States, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=722.8s)]
*  Donald Trump reviewed the smoking gun document [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=724.16s)]
*  that laid out the crime. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=727.12s)]
*  He then talked in detail about the crime with his CFO [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=730.48s)]
*  and with Michael Cohen, and he said, quote, do it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=734.62s)]
*  Quote, he approved it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=740.34s)]
*  So if there's anything in this case [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=745.7s)]
*  that isn't just plainly black litter proven [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=747.34s)]
*  by the documents and the records, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=750.18s)]
*  if there's anything else that we have been waiting for [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=751.98s)]
*  in testimony from witnesses, this is probably it, right? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=754.52s)]
*  One of the things that happened today [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=760.34s)]
*  in Michael Cohen's testimony [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=761.92s)]
*  is that he described the circumstances [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=763.94s)]
*  under which he made a recording of himself [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=766.22s)]
*  speaking to his boss, speaking to Donald Trump. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=769.1s)]
*  It was a recording of an in-person meeting. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=772.1400000000001s)]
*  He walked into Trump's office [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=774.44s)]
*  with the voice notes app on his phone recording [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=776.46s)]
*  while he either held his phone [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=779.8800000000001s)]
*  or had it in his pocket or near his pocket. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=781.3000000000001s)]
*  The reason he said he made the recording [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=783.5s)]
*  is because David Pecker from American media [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=785.36s)]
*  expected to be paid back $150,000 [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=788.5400000000001s)]
*  that American media had advanced [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=793.16s)]
*  to a woman named Karen McDougall [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=795.12s)]
*  who had claimed that she had had a long affair [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=797.0s)]
*  with Donald Trump. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=800.36s)]
*  AMI, as part of its alleged scheme with Donald Trump [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=801.8s)]
*  to suppress negative information about him [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=804.88s)]
*  in order to benefit his campaign, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=807.24s)]
*  had paid McDougall ostensibly to do some work [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=809.36s)]
*  for their magazine empire, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=813.56s)]
*  but really so that they would own the life rights [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=814.92s)]
*  to that story about Donald Trump [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=818.0799999999999s)]
*  and make sure that that story never saw the light of day. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=819.56s)]
*  Now, at some point after AMI had advanced that money, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=822.36s)]
*  Cohen and Trump, according to Trump, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=826.24s)]
*  decided, excuse me, according to Cohen, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=828.44s)]
*  decided that they would purchase those rights from AMI. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=830.52s)]
*  They would effectively reimburse AMI [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=835.72s)]
*  for having made that outlay of cash, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=838.44s)]
*  but in so doing, they would buy those life rights themselves [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=840.74s)]
*  and for a while, they talked about [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=844.64s)]
*  including in that purchase price [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=847.64s)]
*  the treasure chest of information [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=849.92s)]
*  that American media had accumulated over time [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=852.4s)]
*  about the life and loves of Donald Trump, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=855.4799999999999s)]
*  a locked drawer reportedly full of information about Trump. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=858.4s)]
*  They thought for their 150 grand, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=862.42s)]
*  they could get the Karen McDougall rights, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=864.36s)]
*  they could get all the Trump stuff. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=866.56s)]
*  They were worried to get that information [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=868.12s)]
*  because Cohen testified today that David Pecker, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=870.4399999999999s)]
*  the head of this magazine empire, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  they believed was gonna get a different job [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=874.92s)]
*  at Time Incorporated. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=877.0799999999999s)]
*  He was going to leave. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=878.12s)]
*  That would mean David Pecker, their friend and protector, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=879.24s)]
*  the member of this conspiracy with them, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=882.12s)]
*  was gonna leave behind at AMI [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=884.28s)]
*  all of that information about Trump in that locked drawer. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=886.64s)]
*  Wouldn't that be terrible? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=890.92s)]
*  Somebody else might get it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=891.88s)]
*  Wouldn't it be better if we owned that ourselves? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=893.6800000000001s)]
*  So here's Michael Cohen and Donald Trump [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=896.6800000000001s)]
*  in a recording that Cohen made without Trump knowing [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=898.88s)]
*  in a meeting in Trump's office. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=902.32s)]
*  I've spoken to Alan Weisselberg [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=905.34s)]
*  about how to set the whole thing up with funding. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=907.34s)]
*  So what are we gonna pay? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=912.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=914.1s)]
*  And it's all the stuff, all the stuff, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=914.94s)]
*  because you never know where that company, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=917.94s)]
*  you never know where he's gonna be. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=919.94s)]
*  No, he's gonna get you by it. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=920.78s)]
*  Correct. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=921.62s)]
*  So I'm all over that. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=922.46s)]
*  And I spoke to Alan about it [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=923.98s)]
*  when it comes time for the financing, which will be. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=925.42s)]
*  Who is it? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=927.82s)]
*  Who are you financing? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=928.66s)]
*  We'll have to pay you, so. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=929.5s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=931.5s)]
*  We'll have to pay you, so. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=932.46s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=934.4200000000001s)]
*  I got, no, no, no, no, check. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=936.02s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, not cash. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=939.26s)]
*  Check. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=941.1800000000001s)]
*  Why check? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=942.4200000000001s)]
*  Let's bring into the conversation our colleague [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=943.26s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, who is at the courthouse today. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=944.5s)]
*  Also, Katherine Christian, former assistant district attorney [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=946.82s)]
*  at the Manhattan DA's office. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=949.14s)]
*  Thank you, Ms. Christian, for being with us. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=950.3000000000001s)]
*  Lisa, let me ask you, first of all, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=952.62s)]
*  if I characterized the context of that recording correctly. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=954.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=958.3000000000001s)]
*  And when they say Pecker might get hit by a truck, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=959.3s)]
*  what they mean is Pecker might no longer be the custodian [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=963.0999999999999s)]
*  of what we believe is negative information about Trump, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=966.06s)]
*  so we should own that ourselves. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=968.38s)]
*  Correct. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=969.9399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=970.78s)]
*  Why does, or is it clear to you why it matters [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=971.62s)]
*  that Trump is suggesting making this payment in cash, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=975.02s)]
*  even though Cohen argues against that? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=979.02s)]
*  Well, for starters, Trump doesn't want a record of it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=982.62s)]
*  The exact same reasons that Cohen is saying, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=985.66s)]
*  let's cut a check because I want to protect Trump [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=987.9399999999999s)]
*  with a record, is the very same reason [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=990.5s)]
*  that Donald Trump is begging him to use cash, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=992.5799999999999s)]
*  because he wants no one to know about it at all. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=994.78s)]
*  But I think the larger import of the tape [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=997.8199999999999s)]
*  is not about the cash or check. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=999.66s)]
*  It's about situating Donald Trump at the center [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1001.62s)]
*  of this scheme and showing that not only did he join [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1004.54s)]
*  the conspiracy, but that he was involved in each [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1007.14s)]
*  and every plan to execute on that conspiracy [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1010.14s)]
*  by repaying for Karen McDougall's settlement on one hand, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1013.66s)]
*  and then later on paying Stormy Daniels himself. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1016.98s)]
*  When you talk about paying for something [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1019.82s)]
*  in a way that is untraceable, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1023.74s)]
*  or communicating about something in a way that is untraceable, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1025.42s)]
*  is that to a jury or to a court of law? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1028.6200000000001s)]
*  Is that potentially evidence of knowledge of criminality? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1033.74s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1036.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, but again, let's remember that here, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1037.7s)]
*  what the actual crime that's being alleged here [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1039.74s)]
*  is falsification of business records. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1042.22s)]
*  And so this tape doesn't necessarily move the needle [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1043.9s)]
*  about the falsification and Donald Trump's own knowledge [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1047.3000000000002s)]
*  and involvement in that. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1050.5800000000002s)]
*  On the other hand, it shows his motive to be involved [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1051.74s)]
*  in that cover-up because he was directly involved [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1054.98s)]
*  in the crime itself. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1058.66s)]
*  Right, okay. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1059.8600000000001s)]
*  So it's not that this, so this goes to a larger point [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1060.7s)]
*  that we've been talking about tonight, all of us, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1064.5400000000002s)]
*  which is that there is no viable, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1066.74s)]
*  if the prosecution is doing its job, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1069.38s)]
*  there is no viable counter-narrative [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1071.38s)]
*  that Michael Cohen was acting alone, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1074.74s)]
*  that Trump had no idea any of this was happening. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1076.7s)]
*  Rather, the prosecution is presenting a picture [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1079.02s)]
*  of Michael Cohen's actions as situated [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1081.4199999999998s)]
*  and connected to and integral with Trump's own actions. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1083.98s)]
*  Right, Catherine? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1089.06s)]
*  Yeah, and it also goes to intent. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1089.8999999999999s)]
*  And the judge is gonna instruct the jury [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1091.62s)]
*  that the definition of intent, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1093.34s)]
*  it was the defendant's conscious objective [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1095.1799999999998s)]
*  to cause a result. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1097.26s)]
*  So motive, intent, consciousness of guilt. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1098.78s)]
*  What gets me about this relationship, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1101.54s)]
*  it wasn't an attorney-client relationship. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1103.54s)]
*  It was a master servant, no offense to Mr. Cohen. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1105.42s)]
*  So of course these weren't legal expenses [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1108.3400000000001s)]
*  because this was not really an attorney. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1110.26s)]
*  I mean, the prosecution will probably not argue that, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1111.82s)]
*  but this really was not an attorney-client relationship. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1114.94s)]
*  I don't know, again, we keep coming back to this idea [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1119.5s)]
*  that you don't, you know, the burden of proof [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1121.46s)]
*  correctly and constitutionally is on the prosecution. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1123.74s)]
*  I just feel like, and again, maybe I'm thinking of this [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1126.66s)]
*  in a way that it's not the median juror [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1129.3400000000001s)]
*  because I'm exposed in a different way to it, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1131.1000000000001s)]
*  but I do need something to hang on to [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1132.78s)]
*  that's an alternate story for all this stuff. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1135.54s)]
*  I mean, you can raise doubts about it, but I mean like- [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1138.3s)]
*  In order to empathize with the defense? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1140.34s)]
*  In order to think that it wasn't exactly what it looks like. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1141.98s)]
*  I guess I just sort of feel like, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1145.54s)]
*  okay, let's say you gave me some theory that Cohen went rogue. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1147.18s)]
*  This was cooked up by Weisselberg and Cohen. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1151.06s)]
*  Like, maybe that seems plausible [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1153.02s)]
*  and they wanted to do it for the boss, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1155.3s)]
*  but then like, I need something [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1156.58s)]
*  about why Trump writes in the chest, right? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1158.66s)]
*  I can give it to you. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1162.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1162.8600000000001s)]
*  But it's not very strong. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1163.7s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1164.52s)]
*  If you admit the misdemeanor, yeah, business fraud, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1165.5s)]
*  it's on paper, CFO, you lied, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1170.18s)]
*  but you say when Cohen did all this [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1173.5s)]
*  and the defendant's sitting in the White House, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1176.8200000000002s)]
*  he then felt like paying him back, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1178.94s)]
*  so it's partly the rogue, but it's all after the fact. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1180.78s)]
*  If you move the decision, which is still bad, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1183.18s)]
*  later after the fact, you might, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1186.14s)]
*  and tell us what you think, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1187.8600000000001s)]
*  help raise doubt against whether it was contemporaneously [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1189.46s)]
*  consciousness intent at the time before election day, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1192.98s)]
*  which means, again, I'm not here doing free legal service. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1196.6200000000001s)]
*  They already have their plan, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1199.38s)]
*  which means you admit the misdemeanor, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1200.7s)]
*  which is a common defense tactic when you have a bad case, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1202.9s)]
*  then you post-date the other action, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1206.0s)]
*  and that allows for the fact [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1208.1000000000001s)]
*  that it could be true that you reimbursed him. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1209.78s)]
*  And will Donald Trump allow his defense attorneys [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1212.02s)]
*  to say, your honor, we want you to instruct the jury [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1215.3400000000001s)]
*  on the lesser included offense [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1217.5s)]
*  of falsifying business records in the second grade. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1219.14s)]
*  Don't you think that would be, in New York court, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1221.06s)]
*  that would be- Will he allow his lawyers [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1222.62s)]
*  to essentially plead guilty to the misdemeanor? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1224.06s)]
*  Well, not plead guilty, you're permitting it, basically. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1225.66s)]
*  And then he would be, again, assuming the jury says, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1229.14s)]
*  you know what, we don't think it's the higher, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1232.54s)]
*  we don't know where the intent to conceal another crime is, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1234.98s)]
*  but he did intend to defraud. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1238.14s)]
*  But don't you think- And then there's 34 misdemeanor [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1239.62s)]
*  convictions as opposed to felons. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1241.56s)]
*  But don't you think if you have a defendant [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1243.02s)]
*  who's not consumed by ego, that's a better instruction? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1244.46s)]
*  I would give my client, the client can say, hooey. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1248.58s)]
*  If this had been me, I would have pled guilty day one. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1252.66s)]
*  And it would all be over by now. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1254.98s)]
*  All right, our recap of the action today, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1256.7s)]
*  and the Trump criminal trial continues. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1258.5s)]
*  To be clear, I didn't do it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzJ_u4Npv3U&t=1260.14s)]
