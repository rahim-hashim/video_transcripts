# Schiff: Trump indictment 'a vindication of the rule of law'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc)
*  It doesn't matter whether you like him. It doesn't matter whether you dislike him. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=0.0s)]
*  What matters is whether he is a danger to the country because he will do it [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=6.88s)]
*  again. And none of us can have confidence based on his record that he will not do [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=14.0s)]
*  it again because he is telling us every day that he will. California Congressman [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=22.62s)]
*  Adam Schiff led the first impeachment of then President Trump over his [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=28.04s)]
*  withholding military aid to Ukraine and attempting to pressure that country into [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=31.56s)]
*  announcing an investigation into Trump's political rival Joe Biden. After [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=36.36s)]
*  repeatedly surrounding, excuse me, after repeatedly sounding the alarm about [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=40.96s)]
*  Trump's behaviors if left in office and if never held accountable, Congressman [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  Schiff played a pivotal role in the January 6th investigation in Congress [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  and Trump's role in it all. Joining us now is a man who has been telling us this [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=53.04s)]
*  was coming for a long time. California Congressman Adam Schiff, lead [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=58.92s)]
*  impeachment manager for the first impeachment, former member of the January [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=62.6s)]
*  6th investigation. Sir, thanks for being with us tonight. It's nice to see you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=65.24s)]
*  Good to see you. Let me just ask you your top-line reaction to this news. At one [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=68.72s)]
*  level, this is a relatively run-of-the-mill white-collar crime [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=76.44s)]
*  indictment that we believe is about to be unsealed in New York in coming days. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=80.24s)]
*  On the other hand, this is history. It's the first time a former president has [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  faced criminal charges of any kind. It is, you know, a sad and sobering historic day [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=89.6s)]
*  in the life of our country, the first time a president was indicted for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=96.52s)]
*  criminal charges. It is also, I think, a vindication of the rule of law and the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  principle that people should be held accountable whether they're rich and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=105.36s)]
*  powerful, whether they're presidents or former presidents, or whether they're [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=108.92s)]
*  ordinary citizens. That prosecutor should follow the evidence. And if [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  someone needs to go to jail because they were directed in a criminal scheme, then [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  the person that did the directing should also be held to account. But at the same [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  time, it is worrying to see, once again, Donald Trump engage in inciting his [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=125.16s)]
*  supporters, essentially threatening death and destruction, if he were indicted, as [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=133.4s)]
*  he has now been. And it demonstrates, I think, the continuing peril to the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=138.32s)]
*  country. I would just say it would be more perilous if we didn't observe the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=143.84s)]
*  rule of law, if we bred disrespect for the law, if we treated him differently. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=148.96s)]
*  That would be more dangerous. And so this is necessary. But obviously, it's a [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=154.48s)]
*  momentous and tragic day. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=159.88s)]
*  Do you have anything by way of lessons learned as somebody who has been [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=161.48s)]
*  personally targeted by Trump and his supporters because of your efforts in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=167.56s)]
*  trying to hold him accountable and trying to investigate things that he's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=173.0s)]
*  been involved in? I mean, you and all the January 6 committee members all ended up [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=176.48s)]
*  having to get security during that investigation and during Trump's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=180.44s)]
*  response to that investigation. You've been through several rounds of this as [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=185.32s)]
*  sort of Trump's public enemy, number one, in various instances. Any lessons learned [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  for a whole new batch of Americans who's about to go through that same process? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, I don't know whether this is a lesson learned, but it is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=199.2s)]
*  certainly a cause for great concern. And that is, it's one thing for members of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  the Congress who are used to being in the public eye to acclimate to being the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  subject of a violent threat and dangers and risks. It's another. It's going to be [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=213.0s)]
*  very much another thing for an ordinary citizen of New York who gets selected to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=219.08s)]
*  sit on this jury. And I do worry about the extraordinary pressure that those [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=224.24s)]
*  ordinary citizens doing their duty will face. And I would say every effort will [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=230.36s)]
*  be made to protect them. It's a tragic that that is necessary in this country. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=235.88000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, while it began with threats to members of Congress, we now [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  see school board members threatened. We see city council members and county [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=246.68s)]
*  supervisors simply for doing their job. And now we will likely see jurors who are [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=250.32s)]
*  also the subject of threats. And so anticipating that, we need to take steps [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=257.0s)]
*  to protect everyone. And we also, I think, need to get across the message, let the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=262.52s)]
*  courts decide this. This isn't a cause for celebration on the one hand. It's not [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=268.68s)]
*  a cause that never is for violence on the other. We will get through this, but [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=272.52000000000004s)]
*  we're going to have to be careful. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=277.88s)]
*  California Congressman Adam Schiff, lead impeachment manager in the first of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=280.76s)]
*  Trump's two impeachments, member of the January 6 investigation. Sir, thank you [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=284.56s)]
*  for your time. Really appreciate you being here tonight. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqcGy4_XeJc&t=290.6s)]
