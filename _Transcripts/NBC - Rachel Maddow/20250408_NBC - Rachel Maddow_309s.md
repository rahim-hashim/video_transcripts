# Noem turns Homeland Security role into cringey costume theater
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs)
*  Before she was Donald Trump's secretary of Homeland Security, Christy Noem was the governor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=0.0s)]
*  of South Dakota. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=4.88s)]
*  And her time as South Dakota governor was a lot. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=6.88s)]
*  There's so much to say. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=9.96s)]
*  The flooding, the COVID, the daughter's real estate license, that poor dog, the poor [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=12.0s)]
*  goat. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=17.96s)]
*  I mean, honestly, I could go on. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=18.96s)]
*  I could go on. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=19.96s)]
*  But one thing that you may or may not remember about her time as governor of South Dakota [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=22.44s)]
*  was the teeth thing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=26.84s)]
*  While she was serving as governor, Christy Noem, sitting governor, posted on all her [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=29.4s)]
*  social media accounts a long, apparently professionally produced infomercial about her fantastic [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=35.36s)]
*  experience with a dentist in Texas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=43.08s)]
*  Nearly five minutes of the governor speaking straight to camera about this particular dentist [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  and how great this dentist was, interspersed with many, many, many extreme close-ups of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=52.72s)]
*  her Christy Noem mouth. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=58.48s)]
*  I mean, this is a weird thing for a governor to do, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=60.28s)]
*  Governor Noem never disclosed if she was paid for this infomercial or perhaps if maybe she [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=64.28s)]
*  got the dental work for free or at a discount in exchange for doing the infomercial. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=68.86s)]
*  She never disclosed if anyone paid for her travel to Texas. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=74.56s)]
*  But now we know. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=79.16s)]
*  Now we know that someone did pay for that trip. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=80.28s)]
*  It was South Dakota taxpayers. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=83.56s)]
*  In newly released travel records, the AP found that the tens of thousands of dollars in travel [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=86.48s)]
*  expenses Christy Noem billed to the state of South Dakota from when she was governor [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=93.28s)]
*  included $2,200 for a trip to Houston for her Instagram dental work showcase. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  And you know, that, of course, is a real slap in the face to South Dakota taxpayers. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=106.0s)]
*  But in particular, I mean, spare a thought for South Dakota's dentists, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=111.88000000000001s)]
*  How must it feel to be a dental professional in the state of South Dakota and have your own governor [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=116.44s)]
*  bill you and your fellow citizens thousands of dollars so she can go get her teeth done in Texas? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=122.32s)]
*  Because no one in South Dakota is good enough for her and her teeth. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=130.04s)]
*  I mean, Christy Noem is now Donald Trump's secretary of Homeland Security. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=134.52s)]
*  Here she is wearing what appears to be a bulletproof vest at a meeting in New York City. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=141.84s)]
*  Here she is in full Customs and Border Patrol uniform costume on set at Fox News. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=148.08s)]
*  She is not a Customs and Border Patrol agent, but she had to like make her a uniform, I guess, including the hat. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=153.04s)]
*  Here's another hat. Here's her in a cowboy hat, because why not? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=159.36s)]
*  Here she is at the southern border on a horse, because sure, what's a cowboy hat without a horse a few feet below it? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=163.88s)]
*  Here she was a couple of weeks ago posing Abu Graib style in front of prisoners at El Salvador's brutal mega prison, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=171.76s)]
*  where the Trump administration has locked up hundreds of people who were living in the United States. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=181.72s)]
*  And now the new chapter from Christy Noem is here she is doing armed ride alongs with ICE agents, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=186.72s)]
*  where she gets dressed up and she holds big guns and she play acts at hoping personally to arrest people as the secretary of Homeland Security. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=196.6s)]
*  Again, comes with a hat. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=208.44s)]
*  Our friends at the New York Post report today that Noem on this recent ride along brought a friend. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=211.84s)]
*  His name is Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Donald Trump ally and adviser. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=218.72s)]
*  You can see Mr Lewandowski in this New York Post photograph today. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=222.88s)]
*  You can also see him in this very tabloid 2023 report in the New York Post, quote, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=226.4s)]
*  South Dakota Governor Christy Noem having absurdly blatant and public affair with handsy Trump aide Corey Lewandowski. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  Sources say. Claims that Noem and Lewandowski in 2023 denied. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=238.96s)]
*  In noting his presence at the All for the Camera's raid today in Arizona, the New York Post wrote, quote, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  Also in the bearcat with Noem was former Trump campaign manager and senior adviser Corey Lewandowski, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=254.12s)]
*  who introduced himself to federal agents as chief of staff. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security later clarified that he is an adviser to the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=265.68s)]
*  Oh, you're the chief of staff, are you? Chief of staff to what? To who? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  Christy Noem also brought another friend to a notorious right wing social media personality who got a badge for the day and everything. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9wGEqIqJRs&t=280.56s)]
