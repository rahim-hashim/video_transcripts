# 'Switchblade' Drones Included In New U.S. Military Aid Package For Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY)
*  Today, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky gave an impassioned address in a virtual address [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=0.0s)]
*  to U.S. lawmakers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=5.24s)]
*  He once again requested a no-fly zone over his country and pleaded for more security [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=6.92s)]
*  assistance in its conflict with Russia. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Now, a no-fly zone remains off the table, but a few hours later, President Joe Biden [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=14.32s)]
*  authorized a new package of $800 million in military aid. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=18.92s)]
*  This is in addition to the $200 million he approved over the weekend. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=24.64s)]
*  Now, the new aid packages include more of the Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=28.48s)]
*  weapons that the Biden administration had previously sent to Ukraine and which have [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=34.56s)]
*  been used to great effect against Russian troops. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  But the administration is also sending 100 of what it referred to as, quote, tactical [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=41.66s)]
*  unmanned aerial systems. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=47.32s)]
*  Two congressional officials told NBC News today that those tactical unmanned aerial [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=49.8s)]
*  systems are actually something called switchblade drones, similar to the ones that you'd see here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=54.699999999999996s)]
*  They're portable, low-cost, single-use weapons that can strike enemy targets from miles away [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=61.459999999999994s)]
*  and fly much faster than the Turkish drones that Ukraine has been using to date. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=68.06s)]
*  These U.S. switchblade drones are also small enough that they cannot be detected by most [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=73.06s)]
*  air defense systems. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElLNnkb_feY&t=78.86s)]
