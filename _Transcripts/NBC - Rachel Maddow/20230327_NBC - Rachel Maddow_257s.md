# Nashville mayor: 'This is our worst day'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s)
*  Joining us now is the mayor of National Tennessee, John Cooper. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=0.0s)]
*  Mayor Cooper, thank you so much for being with us tonight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  I'm so sorry for what's happened in your city today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=5.28s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  This is our worst day. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=10.16s)]
*  Nashville has had challenges and tragedies before, but we've gone through that, but this [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=12.56s)]
*  is our worst day. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=17.88s)]
*  We're a resilient city, but it's a shock to have to add our name to the list of places [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=18.88s)]
*  where there have been mass killings of children. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=25.1s)]
*  Well, can you tell us about the victims? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=29.540000000000003s)]
*  One of the things that was not clear in the immediate aftermath, but seems clearer now, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=32.22s)]
*  is that while there were six people shot and killed, three little kids and three adults, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=37.900000000000006s)]
*  it doesn't seem like there were other people who were injured, who were hurt and in need [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=43.18s)]
*  of care afterwards. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=48.5s)]
*  Can you tell us anything about the logistics of this, about the victims, about what you [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=50.7s)]
*  know about the circumstances of these deaths? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=54.22s)]
*  Well, the police are working hard. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=58.059999999999995s)]
*  I suspect either tonight or tomorrow they'll be releasing body camera footage and maybe [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=60.22s)]
*  some footage from the school as they're trying to establish the timeline. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=65.7s)]
*  The three adults were two teachers and one custodian, and then the three children. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=71.62s)]
*  But the order in which this happened and how it was this particular six, I don't think [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=81.19999999999999s)]
*  is established. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=87.26s)]
*  I've been told tonight, Mr. Mayor, that you were able to speak with President Biden earlier [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=89.66000000000001s)]
*  this evening. I'm wondering if you can tell us anything about that and what he's been [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=94.02000000000001s)]
*  able to offer. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=97.94s)]
*  Well, I appreciate the president's call. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's a tragedy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=101.26s)]
*  It's one, as he said, he's far too familiar with. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=103.58000000000001s)]
*  He's spent a lot of his lifetime in politics dealing with this increasing epidemic of gun [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=107.34s)]
*  violence where guns and gun violence is the number one cause of childhood death, which [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=113.42s)]
*  is just shocking and needs to be changed. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=120.98s)]
*  I'm grateful he was very knowledgeable about the amazing response time by our police department, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=123.98s)]
*  which arrived quickly and was very effective with the shooter. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=131.58s)]
*  It could have been much worse, clearly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=136.22s)]
*  And again, our very brave officers rushed to gunfire and engaged the shooter. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=140.42s)]
*  And we're grateful for that because it could have been much worse in a school filled with [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=147.42s)]
*  so many children. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=154.94s)]
*  Mayor Cooper, is there anything that you and Nashville need tonight that you don't have? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=156.94s)]
*  Well, we need to support each other. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=162.62s)]
*  I mean, Nashville is a resilient city. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=166.78s)]
*  We're a welcoming city. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=168.62s)]
*  It's a shock that it has happened here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=170.62s)]
*  But there's a mental health challenge. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=173.54s)]
*  I've gotten to speak to a lot of mayors from around the country today where this has happened [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=175.9s)]
*  in their cities. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=180.58s)]
*  And the one thing that they say is the residual mental health needs of the community are underestimated. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=181.66s)]
*  The mental health needs of the officers are underestimated. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=188.74s)]
*  But it is far more toxic and traumatic than you fear, even fear that it will be. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=192.94s)]
*  So in the weeks and months ahead, your thoughts and prayers, and then again, I think accepting [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=201.78s)]
*  that a terrible evil thing has happened. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=208.98s)]
*  And of course, we should feel bad about it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=211.74s)]
*  Mayor John Cooper of Nashville, Tennessee, sir, thank you for joining us on a really [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=215.74s)]
*  difficult night. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=219.62s)]
*  The whole country has Nashville in our thoughts tonight. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=220.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=222.26s)]
*  Well, we appreciate the country having us in those thoughts and prayers. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=223.26s)]
*  And again, let's just hope that we can get beyond this epidemic of gun violence. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=228.1s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=234.54s)]
*  Good luck to you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=235.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpzLc2Rmg3s&t=236.54s)]
