# Like creating a reserve of Beanie Babies: Trump hypes 'strategic crypto reserve'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo)
*  I should say I'm by no means a crypto expert. I'm not going to give you a lecture on blockchain or [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=0.0s)]
*  meme coins or any of that. I just, A, I don't know and B, I don't care. But I do think it's worth [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=5.68s)]
*  looking at this crypto thing a little bit only because it is a deeply, deeply old fashioned, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=12.08s)]
*  simple scam at this point, which points right to the White House. News from the White House tonight [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=17.04s)]
*  really gives us no choice. You have to look at it. Hopefully the broad strokes of crypto trading [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=23.44s)]
*  are not complicated. It's like when there was the beanie baby craze in the late 90s. People started [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=29.36s)]
*  buying these stuffed animals, right? Beanie babies, kind of inherently not worth much, but [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=33.92s)]
*  people were speculating on them, right? It was a beanie baby trading bubble other than maybe some [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=41.2s)]
*  emotional value. If you had one as a child, beanie babies didn't have much inherent value, but it was [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=47.04s)]
*  worth buying up a bunch of them because there was speculation on the premise that as collectibles, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=53.199999999999996s)]
*  maybe one day your beanie baby's collection could be worth a lot of money. Cryptocurrencies operate [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=60.08s)]
*  on the same idea. They have no inherent value at all. The only value they have is if you have some [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=65.44s)]
*  reason to believe that somebody else might want to buy them from you in the future. That's it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=71.84s)]
*  And what that means in very practical terms is that convincing other people [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=78.0s)]
*  that your crypto is popular and in demand, convincing people that your crypto thing is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=85.12s)]
*  going to have value in the future, it's going to be collectible as beanie babies, that is key to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=90.16s)]
*  actually making money. One of the things the SEC alleged a couple of years ago in 2023 was that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=95.44s)]
*  Justin Sun had orchestrated a scheme to pay celebrities to tout his cryptocurrencies [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=102.32s)]
*  without disclosing that he had paid them to do so. So in other words, he was creating the impression [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=108.24s)]
*  of hype and organic enthusiasm around his product when that hype didn't naturally exist. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=114.24s)]
*  That was the allegation, which again, Justin Sun has denied. And now the SEC has halted the case [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=122.0s)]
*  right after he gave more than $50 million to the Trump family. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=128.24s)]
*  The idea of hype in cryptocurrency is that people should buy in soon, right? Get in on the ground [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=133.76s)]
*  floor while it's cheap because it's about to go way up in value because there's so much interest [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=138.88s)]
*  in it. You get it on the ground floor now, you'll make a bundle. It's the whole hype. It's the whole [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=143.04s)]
*  scam. And when I mentioned that the news tonight leaves us not too much, not much choice, but to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=148.32s)]
*  talk about the stuff right now, this is what I mean. The White House just posted this video tonight [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=154.32s)]
*  of Donald Trump signing an executive order establishing a digital Fort Knox, as someone [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  says to the president off camera. Trump apparently signing this executive order, creating what they're [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  describing as a federal government cryptocurrency reserve. Now imagine the Beanie Babies again for a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  second. Imagine Trump had just announced that the US government was going to buy up tons of Beanie [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=182.4s)]
*  Babies. We're going to establish a federal government reserve of billions of Beanie Babies. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  What do you think would happen to the value of Beanie Babies? Right? Oh, it turns out there's a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=198.16s)]
*  huge guaranteed buyer for these things. They're buying billions of them. I should mention that [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=204.72s)]
*  when Trump first brought up this idea, this cryptocurrency national reserve thing on Sunday, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=212.72s)]
*  he name checked five specific cryptocurrencies that would be going into this government reserve. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=220.0s)]
*  And Trump's own cryptocurrency company, his own project, bought $20 million of those currencies, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=227.04s)]
*  of two of those currencies this week ahead of what we now know will be a White House Summit [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=233.76s)]
*  on crypto tomorrow. If the whole idea here is that you hype something by making it appear that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=238.64s)]
*  there is a market, that there's demand, that there's lots and lots of buyers for specific crypto [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=246.72s)]
*  and people who get in on the ground floor and own it, boy, that value is going to go up. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, it would seem that President Trump and his family and the White House specifically are now [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=258.48s)]
*  playing that game. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg8m0QrZ0Zo&t=262.96s)]
