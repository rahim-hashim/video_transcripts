# For Irish Fishermen, Confrontation With Russia Is A Matter Of Protecting Their Livelihood
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0)
*  The second largest natural harbor in the world is in Ireland. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=0.0s)]
*  It's actually in County Cork. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=4.9s)]
*  It is fittingly named Cork Harbor. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=6.74s)]
*  And last spring, actually, something odd happened there. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=10.38s)]
*  And you can see it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=13.08s)]
*  There was a flotilla of fishing boats, about 50 of them, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=14.18s)]
*  that actually went cruising down Cork Harbor [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=19.02s)]
*  in a single file line. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=21.36s)]
*  This was a protest that was organized [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=23.82s)]
*  by a group of Irish fishermen who were upset, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=25.52s)]
*  rightfully so, that their access to their old fishing grounds [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=28.5s)]
*  were being cut as a result of Brexit and everything that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=31.46s)]
*  was as a result of that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=34.8s)]
*  Now, given these particular fishermen's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=36.36s)]
*  history of political activism, it really [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=37.96s)]
*  shouldn't have been less of a surprise [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=40.9s)]
*  when that same group announced their newest plans [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=43.0s)]
*  just this week. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=46.74s)]
*  They said they were going to protest [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  Russia's military exercises planned off the Irish coast [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=49.38s)]
*  next week right in the way of where these fishermen usually [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=52.14s)]
*  do their jobs, where they earn their livelihoods. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=56.34s)]
*  The fishermen said they plan to deploy a flotilla of 60 trawlers [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  in protest right along where Russia is planning [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=62.96s)]
*  those live fire war games. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=66.06s)]
*  In response, the Russian government [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=68.82s)]
*  said any kind of protest by those fishermen [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=70.1s)]
*  would be reckless and even dangerous. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=73.3s)]
*  And today, the Russian embassy, again, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=76.34s)]
*  made it clear that they expect those fishermen to stay very [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  far away from their military exercises. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=83.58s)]
*  The embassy said today in part, quote, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=86.06s)]
*  the ambassador urged the fishermen [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=88.36s)]
*  to refrain from any provocative actions which [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=90.34s)]
*  might endanger all involved. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  Russia's war games are set to start off the Irish coast [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  on Thursday. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=98.68s)]
*  The fishermen said they plan to hit the waters starting Tuesday. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=99.94000000000001s)]
*  Is the plan still on? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  Joining me now is Patrick Murphy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=106.48s)]
*  He is the CEO of the Irish South and West Fish producers [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  organization, the group that we were telling you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  about planning this protest against the Russian Navy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=114.12s)]
*  He met with the Russian ambassador yesterday. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=117.12s)]
*  Mr. Murphy, it is great to have you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=119.66s)]
*  And I know how late it is in Ireland. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  So thank you so much for being here with us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=123.46000000000001s)]
*  First off, tell me what it was like meeting [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=125.76s)]
*  with the Russian ambassador yesterday. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=128.8s)]
*  What did he have to tell you about all of this? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=130.46s)]
*  First of all, Eamonn, it's just great to be on your show [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=134.0s)]
*  and watching all the clips coming in. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm just wondering, is it me that you're [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  showing on the television there and how this came about? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=143.28s)]
*  So meeting an ambassador of any country is an honor, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=147.48s)]
*  regardless of the nation that you're meeting. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=152.12s)]
*  We met the English ambassador when [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=154.96s)]
*  we had trouble with Brexit. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=157.52s)]
*  And we got a two-year extension from that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=159.02s)]
*  So maybe we're getting used to meeting ambassadors. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=161.26s)]
*  We won't turn our show away from any part of the job, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=166.9s)]
*  as long as we keep our boats fishing outside. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=169.94s)]
*  And that is proving more and more difficult. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=172.3s)]
*  So the flotilla first and cork, we start there, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=175.24s)]
*  because maybe that leads into the story. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=178.48s)]
*  With Brexit, Ireland's fishing nation lost 25% of our fish. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=180.88s)]
*  That's a quarter of our fish was taken from us [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=186.02s)]
*  by the European Union and gifted to the United Kingdoms [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=189.12s)]
*  in the trade deal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=193.36s)]
*  And that has left us short of fish. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=195.36s)]
*  And we've seen now that there could be a decimation [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=198.36s)]
*  of our fishing fleet. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=203.06s)]
*  So for an island nation with 29% of the water, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=204.36s)]
*  we could end up with the smallest fleet in Europe, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  with the smallest share of fish in Europe, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=210.5s)]
*  and a dying industry. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=212.36s)]
*  So when this came about, it came about [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=215.60000000000002s)]
*  that we saw it on social media. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=218.44000000000003s)]
*  And we did a little bit of research [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=221.3s)]
*  into what was happening. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=222.8s)]
*  And we didn't like what we found. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=223.94000000000003s)]
*  So we put out the original statement [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=225.94s)]
*  to say that we were going to go fishing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  And that if we were fishing and somebody came along and said, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=231.29999999999998s)]
*  listen, you have to move, at that stage, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=233.88s)]
*  we were going to say, no, not going to happen. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=236.34s)]
*  We're going to continue to fish. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  And the maritime law is on our side, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=241.62s)]
*  despite what our own politicians have [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=244.32s)]
*  done to try and undermine us. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=247.06s)]
*  So let's describe that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=249.12s)]
*  If you're driving down on the motorway, right, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=251.12s)]
*  and somebody comes in off a side road [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=253.82000000000002s)]
*  and drives into the side of you, he's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=256.12s)]
*  the one that caused the collision. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=258.36s)]
*  And it's no different than marine law. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=260.42s)]
*  If you're outside towing a net and somebody comes in [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=262.46000000000004s)]
*  from the side who's not towing a net, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=265.66s)]
*  he's just steaming and hits you, and it's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=267.26s)]
*  the one that's caused the collision. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=269.64s)]
*  It's not you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=271.24s)]
*  You're doing your business. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=272.14s)]
*  So for anybody to say that the fishing boat is the one causing [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=273.54s)]
*  the danger, who would be out there days [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=276.38s)]
*  before the other events are to start in our waters, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=277.94s)]
*  cannot be correct. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=282.18s)]
*  It's not correct as far as we're concerned. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=283.2s)]
*  And this is an area where we get fish. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=285.3s)]
*  It's very complicated. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  You can see behind me up here the area in question. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=290.64s)]
*  And that's a very lucrative place for a fish called nephrops, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=296.34000000000003s)]
*  prawns, or Dublin Bay prawns, or langoustines. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=301.12s)]
*  And they're so important that in Spain, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=304.42s)]
*  when somebody's getting married, to show how good you are [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=306.42s)]
*  or how well off you are, it counts by the amount of prawns [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  that you put on the guest's dinner plate. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=314.08s)]
*  That's what has been reported back to us. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=316.46s)]
*  So that'll tell you how lucrative they are. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=318.85999999999996s)]
*  And as I said, very strict laws. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=321.12s)]
*  So our fishing starts from month to month, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=323.56s)]
*  and you get a certain amount of fish to catch. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=326.29999999999995s)]
*  And if you don't catch it, you can't carry it forward [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  into the next month. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  So you lose it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=332.4s)]
*  So if two boats go out and one catches the full quota of 8 [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=333.67999999999995s)]
*  ton for the month and the other catches 5, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=337.06s)]
*  next month they start off. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  Each boat could get 8 again. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=341.8s)]
*  So the guy with 5 loses the 3. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=343.44s)]
*  So you see, if you're impeding in your effort [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  going out there in the first week, it can be a bust. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=348.8s)]
*  You don't make any money in the first week, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=352.68s)]
*  especially if the trip takes two weeks to make money. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=354.62s)]
*  And within a week, you're told to go home, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=358.38s)]
*  then you're in debt rather than profits. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=361.32s)]
*  So our boats were concerned. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=364.02000000000004s)]
*  That was the main point. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=366.34s)]
*  And the second point, then, is when [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=367.53999999999996s)]
*  we heard that there was going to be [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=368.84s)]
*  ordnance fired into the sky. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=370.14s)]
*  Well, we all know what gravity does. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=372.24s)]
*  Mr. Newton, what goes up must come down. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=375.18s)]
*  So we were concerned about that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  And it's dangerous. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=380.42s)]
*  And you have to understand, Damon, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=381.46s)]
*  we were getting no information from our own government. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=383.32s)]
*  Nobody in the Department of Marine [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=385.96s)]
*  or anybody was telling us anything about this. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  We were clueless. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=389.8s)]
*  So when we put out the statements, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=391.21999999999997s)]
*  and as you've seen in one of the shows there, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=393.16s)]
*  they picked it up. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=396.44s)]
*  And it became a big story very quickly. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=397.44s)]
*  And everybody was talking about it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  And of course, the Russian embassy and the ambassador [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=403.58000000000004s)]
*  heard about it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=407.62s)]
*  And in fairness to them, I give credit where credit is due, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=408.82000000000005s)]
*  they contacted us. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=412.22s)]
*  So when they contacted us and they gave us the warning, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  and we went back and we told them, look, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  we have serious concerns. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=418.92s)]
*  And we sent some correspondence between them [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=420.12s)]
*  between the two of us. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=422.96s)]
*  And within a couple of days, he invited us up to the embassy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=424.26s)]
*  And of course, I represent my fishermen. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=427.64s)]
*  And I do the best that I can. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=432.29999999999995s)]
*  I'm a fisherman myself all my life. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=433.97999999999996s)]
*  I come from a small island community. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=435.78s)]
*  I have seen my friends, some of my friends lost to the sea. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=437.94s)]
*  So I know the dangers of it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=441.52s)]
*  I myself have had a few close calls on the water. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=443.58s)]
*  So I know the dangers of that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=447.67999999999995s)]
*  So we are not adverse to danger in our industry. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=450.36s)]
*  We're not shrinking violets. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=453.90000000000003s)]
*  And it's something that's just ingrained in us. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=456.16s)]
*  So when this came about, we just said very simply, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=460.74s)]
*  all we want to do is fish. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=463.14s)]
*  These are our fishing grounds. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=464.94s)]
*  This is where we fish. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  And we don't see any reason why if somebody else is coming [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=467.44s)]
*  into the grounds that we are the ones that have to make way. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=470.68s)]
*  So that's our stance. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=473.98s)]
*  We said then that it would be our protest [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=476.68s)]
*  is that if the Russian fleet came in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  and they wanted to do their exercises, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=482.26s)]
*  and we were fishing, and they said, go, our protest was, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=484.06s)]
*  no, we're just going to keep fishing here. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=486.86s)]
*  And you have to leave. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=490.06s)]
*  You have to go away. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=491.62s)]
*  And that was the main trust of our protest. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=492.90000000000003s)]
*  And our boats are actually out in that area. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=497.14s)]
*  So they're not going to go out like the flotilla [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=500.54s)]
*  that you've seen in Cork. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=502.78000000000003s)]
*  We gathered them from all over the county. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  Again, protesting about Brexit, because we [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=507.62s)]
*  thought that was the plan is that all those boats that you [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=509.98s)]
*  seen going up the river, every third one, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=513.38s)]
*  they will be eliminated and gone. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=516.36s)]
*  And these are all family businesses [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  that have been built up over generations. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=521.02s)]
*  And we're fighting to stay alive. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  And it's going to be, I think it's, I was going to say, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=525.26s)]
*  I just wanted to jump in there real quick to say, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=527.5s)]
*  because I know it is something that is very important to you [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=529.2s)]
*  and your family and your community. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=531.46s)]
*  It clearly now has geopolitical implications. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=532.9s)]
*  So we will be following this story very closely. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=536.5s)]
*  I'm Patrick Murphy, the CEO of the Irish South and West [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=539.26s)]
*  Fish Producers Organization. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=542.04s)]
*  We wish you and your fishermen, your community safety. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=544.54s)]
*  And we'll be in touch with you over the next couple of days. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=547.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us, Patrick. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFewq_Sb-D0&t=549.48s)]
