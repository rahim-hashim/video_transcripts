# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 19
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE)
*  250 miles north of Mariupol is the second largest city in Ukraine, the city of Kharkiv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a big city. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=5.2s)]
*  It's a cosmopolitan city. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=6.36s)]
*  It's being targeted with Russian missile strikes today. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=7.88s)]
*  Reporters in the city of Kharkiv say those strikes appear to have been aimed right into [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=11.4s)]
*  residential neighborhoods in the city. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=15.8s)]
*  The New York Times had two reports out of Kharkiv today reporting on what appears to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=18.52s)]
*  be, what appear to be adjustments in the Russian strategy in this part of the war, trying to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=22.28s)]
*  avoid the same mistakes that they made in their initial invasion when they went in all [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=28.16s)]
*  over the country, when they tried and failed to take the capital of Kiev. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=32.72s)]
*  The New York Times today, quote, Russia has launched a new campaign with a narrower goal, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  focused primarily on capturing Ukraine's east, and it promises to be much more methodical, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  according to Ukrainian and U.S. officials. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=45.96s)]
*  Instead of lightning attacks from the Russian front lines, Moscow's forces have increased [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=48.44s)]
*  their artillery barrages and sent small detachments of troops to probe Ukrainian lines. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=52.16s)]
*  Known as shaping operations in military circles, these smaller Russian attacks are often precursors [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=58.279999999999994s)]
*  to larger troop movements or serve as a distraction from other fronts. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now from Kharkiv is the correspondent for the New York Times, who's the lead byline [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=69.52s)]
*  in both of those reports. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=73.44s)]
*  His name is Thomas Gibbons Neff. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=74.44s)]
*  Mr. Gibbons Neff is the Kabul bureau chief for the New York Times, but he spent the last [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=76.0s)]
*  month reporting on the ground from Ukraine. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=79.24s)]
*  He brings unique experience to this reporting job. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=81.16s)]
*  He's also served our country as a Marine infantryman with two tours in Afghanistan. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=83.44s)]
*  Mr. Gibbons Neff, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=88.92s)]
*  Hey, thanks for having me. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=91.96s)]
*  So we've been following your reports from Kharkiv and your reports from all the reporting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=93.8s)]
*  that you've done in Ukraine closely. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Can you just give us an update on the scale of what's happening in terms of this phase [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  of the war and what Russia appears to be trying to accomplish? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=104.0s)]
*  Right, it's tough. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=108.28s)]
*  And as you had kind of read in the articles that we had written, they have narrowed their [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=109.4s)]
*  focus, right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=113.76s)]
*  They have thousands of troops kind of located in the east preparing for a larger offensive, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=114.76s)]
*  but taking much less ground than they had set out for in February. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=122.2s)]
*  So that just looks different this time instead of having armored columns and infantry advances [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  and helicopter insertions. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=132.28s)]
*  They're kind of advancing very slowly from predetermined front lines that they've established [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=134.96s)]
*  in the last month and a half, two months. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  So a lot of that's going to look like a lot of artillery fire and then slowly moving their [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  troops underneath that artillery fire as they weaken Ukrainian positions. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=147.84s)]
*  It sounds more efficient the way you describe it that way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=153.32s)]
*  I don't know anything about military tactics and I'm not a veteran like you are who've [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=156.16s)]
*  seen these things at a personal level, but it sounds just from a layman's perspective [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  the way that you're describing that, that this is going to be a massive show of force, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=164.2s)]
*  that it's going to be grinding, but that it also seems to have more military chance of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  success than the earlier tactics that they used in earlier parts of the war. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=174.32s)]
*  Is that a fair assessment? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=178.28s)]
*  I think for the most part, I think it's just going to be a lot slower. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  And I think a lot of that has to do with keeping casualty numbers lower as before in the early [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=184.16s)]
*  parts of the war. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=189.42s)]
*  They suffered, the Russians and the Ukrainians suffered a lot of casualties just in those [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=191.0s)]
*  early weeks in February to March. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=195.4s)]
*  So however it turns out, again, it'll be just much more concerted and where Russian forces [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=199.36s)]
*  will focus on weak points where they can kind of gain as much ground as possible before [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=204.84s)]
*  stopping and regrouping. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  What does this mean for the civilians who are in the path of this part of the Russian [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=212.72s)]
*  offensive? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=218.3s)]
*  Obviously what we have seen in the places where there has been sustained and concerted [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=219.58s)]
*  fighting is that Russia is basically destroying the places that it's trying to take over. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=223.22s)]
*  The city of Mariupol is in many, to a large extent, rubble. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=228.14000000000001s)]
*  And that's true in a lot of cities in eastern Ukraine that have been the target of sustained [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=232.94s)]
*  fighting thus far. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  Is there any effort, is there any strategic imperative to try to preserve anything about [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=238.3s)]
*  the livability of these cities or any of its infrastructure, or are they just raising things [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=243.70000000000002s)]
*  to the ground? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=248.6s)]
*  I mean, I think a lot of this going forward, I think what we've seen so far is there's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=249.6s)]
*  been a focus on weapons of the US and the West are supplied like the Javelin, which [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=255.32s)]
*  is an anti-tank guided missile that's gotten a lot of attention. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=259.76s)]
*  But at the end of the day, this is an artillery war and that means a lot of destruction no [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  matter where the fighting is. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=270.04s)]
*  So and of course, just like in any conflict, the civilians and the innocents are caught [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=272.68s)]
*  in the middle. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=277.44s)]
*  So as this moves in the East, people living in towns and cities will be caught in the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=279.28s)]
*  middle if they can't evacuate. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=284.6s)]
*  Again, there's always a big chunk of people who just stay behind because they can't leave. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=286.6s)]
*  They're taking care of elderly family members. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=290.96s)]
*  They're sick. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=293.24s)]
*  So again, whatever happens next, it's going to be the civilians caught in the middle that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=294.72s)]
*  will bear the brunt of this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=299.88s)]
*  In the United States, there's been a lot of attention to the shift in what the US government [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=303.8s)]
*  is providing, that the US is providing artillery rounds and howitzers and the other kinds of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=308.4s)]
*  weapons that at least echo the way that Russia is fighting its side of the war. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you believe that any of the weapons shipments from the United States, from the European [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=319.32s)]
*  Union, from any Ukraine's other allies could make a difference? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=323.08s)]
*  Is there enough material that can be moved into Ukraine to help them find some sort of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=326.76s)]
*  equipoise in this conflict or even to turn the tables? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=333.24s)]
*  I mean, that's always the question. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=335.96s)]
*  And I think just from what we've heard, the shortage of ammunition, I mean, it really [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=338.84s)]
*  comes down to bullets and band-aids. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=344.76s)]
*  They need a lot of that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  The Ukrainians need a lot of that to hold the line, let alone retake territory. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  So it remains to be seen, but it'll be something I think that the West, the United States especially, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  is keeping a pretty close eye on. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=358.96s)]
*  In terms of your plans and your reporting, I mentioned that you've got unique experience [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=361.88s)]
*  because you're on personal history that you bring to this reporting. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=366.52s)]
*  But what are your plans? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=368.96s)]
*  I mean, I don't have to get too specific with me. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=371.52s)]
*  Do you feel like you and your colleagues can safely report from where you are in Ukraine? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=373.64s)]
*  Do you have plans to move to try to stay in safer places? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=379.92s)]
*  I mean, as far as, I mean, Kharkiv is shelved daily. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=384.92s)]
*  I think, like you said, it's a big city. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=389.8s)]
*  There's places outside of the shelving where we can stay. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=393.48s)]
*  But I mean, I think, again, going forward, I mean, we have every intent of covering this [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=397.08s)]
*  war, where it is and where this offensive pushes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=402.44s)]
*  Thomas Givens-Neff, Kabul bureau chief of The New York Times, joining us now after four [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=407.68s)]
*  o'clock in the morning from Kharkiv, Ukraine. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=412.48s)]
*  I'm not helping you do your job by keeping up until past four in the morning to talk [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=414.84s)]
*  to me. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=418.28s)]
*  I'll let you go, sir. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=419.28s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time and good luck. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=420.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=422.32s)]
*  What I know about investigations is they're kind of like peeling back an onion. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=424.64s)]
*  And as you go through each layer, you learn different things. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=429.4s)]
*  To be a responsible prosecutor, you must look at all of those things in investigation. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=432.0s)]
*  To be fair to everyone involved, this is a very important matter, as you've already highlighted. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  And so, yes, the investigation seems that it will go past just this one phone call that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  we've discussed and that you played for your viewers. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=447.76000000000005s)]
*  That was Georgia state prosecutor, the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, Fonny [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  Willis, speaking on this show last year. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=456.16s)]
*  We had that interview with her here just days after she announced that her office had opened [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=458.92s)]
*  a criminal investigation into President Trump's efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 election [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  results. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=468.72s)]
*  She told us in that clip that it went beyond Trump's direct phone call to the Georgia [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=469.72s)]
*  secretary of state telling him that he needed to find a specific number of votes so that [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=473.76s)]
*  he could be declared the winner of the state. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=478.12s)]
*  She said that it was like peeling an onion and they would be looking at everything related [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=480.96s)]
*  to those efforts to interfere with Georgia's election results. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=485.24s)]
*  Well, it's been a little over 14 months since Fonny Willis's office began that investigation. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=488.56s)]
*  Today, we're learning more about where it stands and where things are headed. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=493.84s)]
*  You might remember that earlier this year, a panel of Georgia judges cleared the way [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=496.88s)]
*  for a special grand jury to be seated in this case to look at potential criminal charges [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=500.59999999999997s)]
*  against former President Trump. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, today in a new interview in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, district attorney Willis [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=506.59999999999997s)]
*  has confirmed something of a timeline for that special grand jury. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=511.0s)]
*  She says she expects the grand jury will be seated starting May 2nd and they'll start [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=514.72s)]
*  hearing from witnesses as of June 1st. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=519.36s)]
*  In today's interview, she also notes for the first time that her investigation has already [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=522.36s)]
*  taken voluntary testimony from at least 50 people. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=525.72s)]
*  She told the paper today that with the grand jury being seated now, she plans to seek subpoenas [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=530.52s)]
*  for an additional 30 other people at least. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=535.44s)]
*  Of course, part of the special grand jury's job will be to sign off on subpoenas for folks [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  who won't voluntarily testify but will once they are compelled to by the grand jury. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=543.76s)]
*  But then come June 1st, that grand jury is expected to start hearing from all the witnesses [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=549.04s)]
*  themselves. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=552.96s)]
*  So all of that is new and notable. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=554.0s)]
*  I will tell you there's one other piece of that interview with the AJC that stood out [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=556.0s)]
*  for me today. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=559.92s)]
*  Fannie Willis and her team have faced threats from very early on ever since they first [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=561.76s)]
*  announced this investigation. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=567.4799999999999s)]
*  That's one of the things we first talked to her about in February 2021. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=568.9599999999999s)]
*  She was very candid about the threats that had come in to her and to her office since [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=572.64s)]
*  the investigation had been announced. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=576.1999999999999s)]
*  But in this latest interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, she pointedly, quote, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=578.36s)]
*  declined to name the lead prosecutor she has assigned to the probe, citing security precautions. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=582.16s)]
*  She also told the paper that she has recently ordered bulletproof vests for her prosecutors [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=588.52s)]
*  who are working on this case. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=593.72s)]
*  Obviously that is bracing to hear, but more than ever, it appears that this investigation [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=596.28s)]
*  is full steam ahead. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=601.12s)]
*  Now we have a bit of a timeline for it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=603.64s)]
*  Tick tock. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=605.44s)]
*  As we reported here last night, a federal judge in Florida yesterday decided to strike [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=606.44s)]
*  down the CDC's mask rule for airline travel, train travel, and public transportation. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=612.84s)]
*  It was a little bit of a strange decision by that judge. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=618.44s)]
*  She made the decision even without hearing arguments in the case. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  She said she didn't need to hear the argument. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=626.38s)]
*  She just ruled on her own. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=627.86s)]
*  And she said her ruling would apply nationwide, even though the plaintiffs only brought suit [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=629.88s)]
*  in her single district in Florida. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=634.08s)]
*  Nevertheless, that immediate change ordered by that one judge to this nationwide public [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=637.12s)]
*  health rule has immediate consequences. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=642.72s)]
*  If you, for example, flew out somewhere for spring break before yesterday's shock ruling, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=645.24s)]
*  you're going to find yourself flying home from spring break under very different public [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=651.72s)]
*  health rules than you might have been counting on. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=655.4s)]
*  And maybe that doesn't matter to you. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=658.36s)]
*  Maybe you didn't feel strongly about it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=659.64s)]
*  Maybe you weren't factoring that into your sort of COVID safety matrix when you were [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=660.96s)]
*  planning this travel. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  But maybe it does matter to you. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=667.28s)]
*  Maybe it was a big factor. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=668.8s)]
*  The context in which this happened, not just its suddenness, that matters here, too. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=671.8s)]
*  The CDC had just decided last week that they were going to extend the mask rule until May [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=677.0s)]
*  3rd. It's a short extension. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=682.5999999999999s)]
*  They just wanted to give the agency a few more weeks to assess what the current uptick [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=685.0s)]
*  COVID cases might mean for our health care system, for hospitalizations, for deaths. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  They needed a little more time to assess how much the mask rule might help avert the worst [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=696.48s)]
*  of those consequences. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=701.44s)]
*  And so, again, they plan to extend it just until May 3rd. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=702.88s)]
*  May 3rd is right around the corner. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=706.08s)]
*  Now that this judge has thrown out the ruling, effective immediately nationwide, well, that [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=708.9200000000001s)]
*  timing has to factor into the government's decision as to whether or not to appeal. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=715.04s)]
*  Right? By the time they've brought the appeal, May 3rd probably will have come and gone, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=720.24s)]
*  which means the extension that the judge ruled against would effectively be moot. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=724.64s)]
*  Given the timing here, it has been an open question and an interesting one as to whether [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=730.7199999999999s)]
*  the Justice Department would try and appeal. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=734.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, today, the Justice Department gave an answer to that question. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=736.8s)]
*  Quote, the department continues to believe that the order requiring masking in the [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=739.9599999999999s)]
*  transportation sector is a valid exercise of the authority Congress has given CDC to [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=743.12s)]
*  protect the public health. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=748.0s)]
*  That's an important authority the department will continue to work to preserve. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=749.84s)]
*  If CDC concludes that a mandatory order remains necessary for the public's health after that [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=754.04s)]
*  assessment, the Department of Justice will appeal the district court's decision. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=758.88s)]
*  So the DOJ is trying to reinforce that the CDC has the authority to set rules for public [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=763.84s)]
*  health. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=769.52s)]
*  They're trying to give CDC room to continue assessing whether a mask rule is needed, whether [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=770.24s)]
*  it's still a necessary public health measure. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=775.72s)]
*  But when it comes to the bigger potentially existential question of whether the CDC has the [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=779.84s)]
*  authority to put public health rules in place in the middle of a pandemic, is that question still [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=783.88s)]
*  open as long as this judge's ruling goes unchallenged? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=788.72s)]
*  And what does that mean for doctors and nurses treating patients as the number of COVID cases [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=792.12s)]
*  starts to tick back up again? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=797.4s)]
*  Joining us now is Dr. Craig Spencer. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=800.32s)]
*  He's the director of global health and emergency medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=802.12s)]
*  Center. He's also he is an emergency room doctor practicing in New York City. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=806.08s)]
*  He's also a doctor with personal experience with scary contagious diseases. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=810.64s)]
*  He was the first person in New York City to be diagnosed with Ebola back in 2014 after he [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=814.76s)]
*  returned from treating Ebola patients in Africa. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=819.64s)]
*  When the COVID pandemic in New York City hit in March 2020, Dr. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=823.24s)]
*  Spencer was on the front lines treating patients at the very worst of that time. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=827.88s)]
*  Dr. Spencer, it's a real pleasure to have you back on the show. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=831.76s)]
*  Thanks for making time to be here with us tonight. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=833.8s)]
*  Thank you for having me back on. It's a pleasure. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=836.6800000000001s)]
*  So it seems to me that there's two things to think about in terms of this judge's ruling. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=839.88s)]
*  One is just the practical question. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=846.0s)]
*  People may be watching you right now with your experience as a specialist in this field, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=848.84s)]
*  as a practicing physician in New York. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=853.32s)]
*  Is it a good idea to wear a mask on the train, on the subway, on an airplane, even if I'm no [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=855.4s)]
*  longer required? But also, what's your view on this challenge to the CDC, the authority to put a [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=861.72s)]
*  rule like this in place at all? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=867.0s)]
*  Well, those are incredibly important questions. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=870.2s)]
*  And I will add that not only as a provider, but as a parent of a three year old and a one year old [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=872.36s)]
*  who three days ago took a flight to visit family and has to fly back home to New York City in a few [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=877.4s)]
*  days under these new rules, it does give me some trepidation. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=882.76s)]
*  My three year old and one year old, one can wear a mask, but they're both unvaccinated. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=886.52s)]
*  The one year old can't. And so it does give me some pause and some worry. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=890.1999999999999s)]
*  I would have preferred that they were on a flight where people were masked. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=893.16s)]
*  But we're going to have to adapt and we're going to have to think about how to keep [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=897.8s)]
*  ourselves safe. But my most recent flight before that was with my family to go down and visit [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=900.4399999999999s)]
*  immunocompromised family members in Florida. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=905.48s)]
*  And so I'm just worried that there's going to be a lot of people in similar situations that will be [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=907.72s)]
*  exposed and may expose others. For myself personally, I'm young, I'm healthy, I've been [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=911.16s)]
*  triple vaccinated. My personal risk isn't high. But the risk to others that I might in fact or to [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=916.9200000000001s)]
*  my kids may be. And that's for the personal and for the family risk. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=921.8000000000001s)]
*  Now, for the more important, I think, legal precedent, what you saw here was not a public [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=925.4s)]
*  health decision. You had a legal decision that overrode the decisions of a public health [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=930.6s)]
*  authority in the middle of a pandemic. And I'm not just worried about what that means right now, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=937.24s)]
*  today, for flights in the next few days and for the uptick in cases. I'm worried about what that [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=941.88s)]
*  means for the future when we respond to pandemics, when we have further pathogens that threaten us [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=947.16s)]
*  here in the U.S. We've already had dozens of states implement measures to limit public health [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=953.16s)]
*  authority. Now you have a single judge in one state who has overrode a decision by the central [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=958.2s)]
*  public health decision-making authority. And I think that sets a bad precedent. And I'm glad [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=965.32s)]
*  to see the administration challenging that. And the administration says they will challenge it [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=969.8000000000001s)]
*  provided that the CDC assesses in scientific terms that a continued mask mandate, that a continued [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=976.12s)]
*  mask rule for public transit actually is in the public health interest. And so they're effectively, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=983.4s)]
*  the Justice Department is effectively saying that they're going to follow the science, that if the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=989.0s)]
*  CDC still thinks this type of rule should be in effect, then they will appeal the ruling in order [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=993.0799999999999s)]
*  to try to reassert the CDC's authority to make those decisions. It still does feel a little [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=1000.1999999999999s)]
*  precarious in terms of the standing of the CDC to pass these rules in the future. I mean, I [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=1005.4s)]
*  understand why the DOJ is deferring to them, but that presidential issue you're talking about is [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=1011.56s)]
*  real here. Absolutely. And also quite frankly, it's a very confusing point in the pandemic for [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=1015.7199999999999s)]
*  many people. If you are young and you've been vaccinated, you may think that your personal [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=1022.04s)]
*  risk is low. And you may say, well, we know that masks work and we know that having them in [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=1026.12s)]
*  congregate settings work. What is even the decision that needs to be made here? What is the CDC even [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=1030.6799999999998s)]
*  looking at? We know that right now, VA too, that subvariant is spreading. We've seen it in New York [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=1035.8s)]
*  and we know that it's causing an uptick in cases nationally. We need to better understand what that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=1042.12s)]
*  means, not only for local outbreaks, for bigger outbreaks in places like New York City and in [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtINKutswCE&t=1046.84s)]
