# Maddow: Trump's record of disgrace makes for awkward Republican convention
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY)
*  Tonight, the Republican convention comes to its conclusion as the Republican [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=0.0s)]
*  Party's presidential nominee gives his acceptance speech. And he is giving this [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  acceptance speech. I think it cannot be overstated. He is giving this acceptance [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=8.76s)]
*  speech in truly unique, even bizarre circumstances. I mean, there's no nicer [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=14.1s)]
*  way to say this, but he is a felon recently convicted of 34 felony [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=20.84s)]
*  charges, now awaiting sentencing for those charges facing up to four years in prison. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=27.38s)]
*  He's also under indictment in other jurisdictions, not only a multi-count [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=31.78s)]
*  RICO criminal indictment under Georgia state law, but also a multi-count federal [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=36.18s)]
*  criminal indictment in D.C. District Court in Washington. Happily for the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=40.58s)]
*  nominee, but just adding to the weirdness of it for all the rest of us, at this [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=45.739999999999995s)]
*  moment, he is no longer facing multiple additional felony federal charges in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=51.38s)]
*  Florida under the Espionage Act. But that's only thanks to a shock ruling from [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=56.78s)]
*  a judge he appointed in his last days in office. That shock ruling is now being [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=62.18000000000001s)]
*  appealed, which means if the appeal by prosecutors is successful, we might [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=67.38s)]
*  expect that the nominee will end up federally indicted under the Espionage [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=71.98s)]
*  Act again, in addition to the other charges he is still facing. The Espionage Act [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=76.10000000000001s)]
*  charges, of course, relate to bizarre revelations about him hoarding and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=81.9s)]
*  hiding hundreds of classified documents, including very classified documents, at [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=87.10000000000001s)]
*  his home in Florida after his presidency, even after federal authorities let him [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=93.0s)]
*  know that he had these documents when he should not have and he needed to give [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  them back. The charges of which he was already convicted in New York derive [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=101.2s)]
*  from him using the family business he inherited from his father to cover up [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=106.8s)]
*  payments he made to a woman named Stormy Daniels to try to stop her from speaking [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  publicly before the 2016 election about an unpleasant sexual encounter, she says [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=117.4s)]
*  she endured with Mr. Trump about a year after he married the former first lady, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=123.4s)]
*  Melania Trump, and not long after she gave birth to their son. Although Mr. Trump [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=128.9s)]
*  denied that that alleged sexual encounter took place, Mrs. Trump, Melania [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  Trump, was conspicuously absent from that trial even when the jury delivered its [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  verdict that he was guilty on all 34 felony counts. Mrs. Trump has still been [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=144.1s)]
*  even more conspicuously absent from every one of his campaign trail events [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  this entire year and almost all his other events as well since he left the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=153.7s)]
*  White House, which is not a typical president and first lady arrangement, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=158.6s)]
*  which of course is fine. Who among us knows what makes anyone else's marriage? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=164.6s)]
*  Love is a many splendid thing, but that record of her [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=169.6s)]
*  That's really good. I want everybody to know at home. I can also hear you through the television. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=184.7s)]
*  So be on your best behavior. The record of Melania Trump avoiding being seen [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=191.7s)]
*  with her husband ever for years at a time now does make it notable that we're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=199.1s)]
*  about to see something very unusual. We are about to see within the next few [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  minutes that she is in Milwaukee tonight, that she is in the building at the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=208.7s)]
*  Republican Convention for Donald Trump's acceptance of the Republican presidential [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=212.6s)]
*  nomination this evening. That itself a notable and unusual circumstance. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=216.7s)]
*  When Donald Trump left the presidency in January 2021, he did not attend the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=222.2s)]
*  inauguration of his successor. That itself unique in American history. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=227.7s)]
*  Trump left in his wake the worst incidents of political violence the country [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=232.6s)]
*  has ever seen in a presidential transition. The only time we haven't had [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=238.1s)]
*  a peaceful transition of power from one president to the next, arguably ever [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=242.0s)]
*  arguably since the Civil War. The criminal charges that are still pending [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=246.1s)]
*  against the Republicans presidential nominee, the ones in Georgia and Washington, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=250.7s)]
*  they relate to his refusal to leave office after he was voted out. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=254.5s)]
*  They relate to the violent coup attempt that he launched, the mob of his supporters [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=259.0s)]
*  that tried to physically stop Congress from certifying the results of the election [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=263.8s)]
*  in which he was voted out of office. That election, I remind you, was not closed. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=268.0s)]
*  Donald Trump lost his reelection bid by more than 7 million votes and by more [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=274.2s)]
*  than 70 electoral votes. And that electoral failure is emblematic of his [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=279.6s)]
*  performance as the Republican Party's leader. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=286.1s)]
*  Yes, he did get elected to the presidency in 2016, but then under his leadership [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=288.8s)]
*  the Republican Party lost the House. The Republican Party lost the Senate. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=293.5s)]
*  The Republican Party lost the White House when he as president really was voted [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=298.8s)]
*  out of office resoundingly after just one term, leaving the country in the grips [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=303.3s)]
*  of a crippling COVID pandemic, which would go on to kill more than a million [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=307.8s)]
*  Americans mitigated only by the advent of effective vaccines, which he mostly [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=312.3s)]
*  now denigrates and disavows. He also left the country with his Supreme Court [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=317.4s)]
*  onto which he installed three new hardline, ultra conservative justices who, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=322.4s)]
*  true to his promise, soon overturned Roe vs. Wade, throwing women's rights [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=328.4s)]
*  in this country into a very, very fast reverse gear, ushering in draconian [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  abortion bans in Republican controlled states across the country, leading [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=340.29999999999995s)]
*  quickly thereafter to Republican-led efforts to ban in vitro fertilization, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=344.7s)]
*  to even ban and restrict birth control, leading Republicans in Washington [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  and in the most influential conservative advocacy groups to start their plans [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=356.0s)]
*  for a national abortion ban, for birth control restrictions, for even things [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=360.0s)]
*  like a ban on pornography, a ban on no fault divorce. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=364.4s)]
*  It is a wild record on which to try to build a return to power. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  But here we are. They are nominating a felon, one who left office in a storm [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=374.8s)]
*  of violence that among other things injured dozens of police officers, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=380.8s)]
*  violence for which hundreds of his supporters have pled guilty or been convicted [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=385.2s)]
*  of serious crimes. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=390.6s)]
*  We put criminals where they belong, in jail. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=393.2s)]
*  Cops are good, criminals are bad. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump stands with the people and the police, our men and women in blue, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  not with the criminals and the rioters. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=406.5s)]
*  It has made for a very awkward Republican National Convention because he [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=409.2s)]
*  literally does stand with the rioters, promising that he will spring them all [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=412.5s)]
*  from prison, calling them martyrs and political prisoners saying they've just [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=417.7s)]
*  been unjustly persecuted and they did nothing wrong. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=424.2s)]
*  After this is how he left office, after a ransacked Capitol was left in the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=430.4s)]
*  wake of the mob of his supporters that he sent to Congress to try to physically [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=435.79999999999995s)]
*  use force to keep him in power. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  It did not seem at the time like it would ever be an open question as to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=443.7s)]
*  whether America would try to see this as good. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=448.0s)]
*  I think that was a great try and we're sure glad they did that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=452.9s)]
*  Boy, we wish these people had done more of it, that they'd gotten their way. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=456.3s)]
*  These people tasering and bear spraying police officers and smashing their way, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=460.5s)]
*  literally smashing their way onto the floor of Congress and rifling through [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=467.1s)]
*  senators desks and taking what they wanted and ransacking the speaker's office. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=472.8s)]
*  It did not seem at the time like we had any lack of clarity as a country as to [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=478.7s)]
*  whether or not it would be a good thing or a bad thing for our country if this [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=487.4s)]
*  guy with the paramilitary gear and the zip ties to tie people up. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=491.4s)]
*  It did not seem like we had any lack of clarity in considering whether it would [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=498.0s)]
*  be a good thing if this guy had gotten his hands on the members of Congress [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  he was hunting for and what was he going to do with those zip ties and what if [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=508.6s)]
*  it had been the vice president? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=513.3000000000001s)]
*  But that's where we are. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=517.0s)]
*  Tonight with the Republican Party almost by acclamation nominating the man who [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=520.3000000000001s)]
*  used that violence to try to stay in power nominating him to once again become [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=527.0s)]
*  president only this time they have picked him a running mate who says that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=532.3000000000001s)]
*  you wouldn't have had to threaten to hang him to try to get him to go along [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=536.9s)]
*  with the coup. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=540.5s)]
*  Ohio Senator JD Vance was picked for the job after he said publicly on television [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  that had he been the vice president when this happened he would have done it. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  He would have got along with it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=551.9s)]
*  He would have thrown out the results of the election. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=552.9s)]
*  And so it's only been three and a half years and 88 felony counts against [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=558.3s)]
*  Donald Trump since then. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=564.6s)]
*  But the Republican Party is back offering more of this please. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=567.0s)]
*  This is RNC this Republican National Convention saw one of Trump's former [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=574.1s)]
*  advisors take a plane to the convention direct from prison. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=577.6s)]
*  Unlike many other Trump advisors. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=582.6s)]
*  He was not in jail on on on fraud or corruption charges. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=584.3000000000001s)]
*  He was in jail after he took credit for helping to conceive of and to try to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=588.6s)]
*  implement the plan to stop the certification of the election results to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=594.3s)]
*  pressure Vice President Mike Pence to rejecting the election results from [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=598.4s)]
*  states Trump lost Peter Navarro took credit for conceiving and trying to [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=601.8s)]
*  implement that plan and then he refused a subpoena to testify about it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=606.3s)]
*  And so that's why he had to come to the RNC from prison whereupon he received [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=610.5s)]
*  the largest hero's welcome that any of the speakers or guests have received on [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=615.4s)]
*  any of the nights of the convention this week. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=621.8s)]
*  But he was just one of the figures who faced criminal charges related to the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=624.8s)]
*  coup who was celebrated at the convention this week the fake Trump [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=628.0s)]
*  electors from Nevada. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=631.4s)]
*  They recently just recently had the charges against them dropped on [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=633.0s)]
*  jurisdictional technical grounds. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=636.1999999999999s)]
*  Several of them are delegates to the Republican Convention along with the fake [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=638.0s)]
*  electors from Michigan. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=642.0s)]
*  They are under criminal indictment. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=643.0s)]
*  Several of them are delegates to this convention. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=644.6999999999999s)]
*  So are some of the fake electors from Arizona. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=647.5999999999999s)]
*  They are under criminal felony indictment. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=649.9s)]
*  They are also now delegates to this Republican National Convention. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=652.5s)]
*  In fact all seven states that participated in the fake electors scheme [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=655.9s)]
*  as part of the coup to try to keep Trump in power after he was voted out all [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  seven states Republican parties in all seven of those states have sent at [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=664.3s)]
*  least one of their fake electors to be a delegate at this Republican National [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  Convention. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=672.4s)]
*  And that is just the flavor of it right to the former president's other [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=674.9s)]
*  advisors whom he pardoned after they were convicted of federal crimes and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=679.9s)]
*  sentenced to prison two of them you see them here spotted this week on the RNC [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=683.6999999999999s)]
*  floor in Milwaukee mobbed by fans greeted warmly. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=688.1999999999999s)]
*  And we have been slowly boiling in this water. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=693.0s)]
*  We have been slowly boiling in this reality for long enough that it is [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=700.3s)]
*  possible to lose sight of just how radical this moment actually is. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=705.4s)]
*  But Republicans really are going to nominate a felon who tried to overthrow [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=710.3s)]
*  the US government by force despite all the people who have gone to prison for [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=714.6999999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=718.6s)]
*  They have decided that force was justified and that they they in no way [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=718.9s)]
*  shape or form are suggesting that they won't do it again right to the country. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=726.6999999999999s)]
*  It is it's the plan in the Republican Party is this time planning overtly in [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=731.1999999999999s)]
*  advance that there is not going to be a normal certification of the election [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=736.4s)]
*  this year. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=740.0s)]
*  They have laid the groundwork already and are implementing efforts already to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=741.0s)]
*  have Republican County and state officials refuse to certify election [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=744.5s)]
*  results from the get-go. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=748.6999999999999s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=751.4s)]
*  The consequence of that is that there will not be state certified election [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=753.3s)]
*  results sitting there tidily in a box ready to be opened and counted [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=757.4s)]
*  ceremonially on January 6th. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=762.3s)]
*  There won't be state certified election results. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=764.7s)]
*  So there can't be just a count of which states were won by each candidate, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=767.3000000000001s)]
*  which is how we're supposed to elect presidents in this country. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=771.1s)]
*  As the New York Times put it recently quote the strategy involves an ambitious [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=773.7s)]
*  and legally dubious attempt to reimagine decades of settled law dictating how [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=777.5s)]
*  results are officially certified in the weeks before the transfer of power. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=782.4s)]
*  I mean, here's where we are the first time the Republican Party chose Donald [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=789.0s)]
*  Trump as their nominee for president. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=792.3000000000001s)]
*  He won the presidential election. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=794.6s)]
*  His presidency is viewed by historians as the worst presidency in the history [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=797.3000000000001s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=801.5s)]
*  He was impeached twice. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=804.0s)]
*  The second time they chose him as their party's nominee for president. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=807.2s)]
*  He lost the general election and it ended in a violent failed effort to [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=810.2s)]
*  retain power by force. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=815.2s)]
*  Now they are choosing him again with whatever you call the opposite of regret [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=817.7s)]
*  for how it worked out the last time. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=822.4s)]
*  And with an all but explicit promise to do it again. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=825.3000000000001s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=829.6s)]
*  Next round starts tonight. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=831.5s)]
*  See you there. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N12fXz9dtNY&t=854.6s)]
