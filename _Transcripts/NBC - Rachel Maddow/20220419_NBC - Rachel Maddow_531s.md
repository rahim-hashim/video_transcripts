Video Description: Dr. Craig Spencer, an emergency room doctor, talks with Rachel Maddow about the ending of the CDC's mask requirement for public travel by judicial fiat instead of as a public health consideration, and concerns about what the ruling means for the ability of the U.S. to deal with future public health emergencies.

# Trump Judge's Override Of CDC On Masks Raises Concerns For Future Public Health Measures
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk)
*  As we reported here last night, a federal judge in Florida yesterday decided to strike [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=0.0s)]
*  down the CDC's mask rule for airline travel, train travel and public transportation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=5.76s)]
*  It was a little bit of a strange decision by that judge. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=11.28s)]
*  She made the decision even without hearing arguments in the case. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=14.98s)]
*  She said she didn't need to hear the argument. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=19.32s)]
*  She just ruled on her own. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=20.8s)]
*  And she said her ruling would apply nationwide, even though the plaintiffs only brought suit [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=22.84s)]
*  in her single district in Florida. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=27.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, that immediate change ordered by that one judge to this nationwide public [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=29.64s)]
*  health rule has immediate consequences. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=35.6s)]
*  If you, for example, flew out somewhere for spring break before yesterday's shock ruling, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=38.08s)]
*  you're going to find yourself flying home from spring break under very different public [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=44.56s)]
*  health rules than you might have been counting on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=48.24s)]
*  And maybe that doesn't matter to you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=51.24s)]
*  Maybe you didn't feel strongly about it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=52.5s)]
*  Maybe you weren't factoring that into your sort of COVID safety matrix when you were [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=53.84s)]
*  planning this travel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=58.92s)]
*  But maybe it does matter to you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=60.32000000000001s)]
*  Maybe it was a big factor. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=61.92s)]
*  The context in which this happened, not just its suddenness, that matters here, too. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=64.78s)]
*  The CDC had just decided last week that they were going to extend the mask rule until May [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=70.0s)]
*  3rd. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  It's a short extension. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=76.60000000000001s)]
*  They just wanted to give the agency a few more weeks to assess what the current uptick [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=77.98s)]
*  in COVID cases might mean for our health care system, for hospitalizations, for deaths. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=82.64s)]
*  They needed a little more time to assess how much the mask rule might help avert the worst [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  of those consequences. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=94.28s)]
*  And so again, they plan to extend it just until May 3rd. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=95.88000000000001s)]
*  May 3rd is right around the corner. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=99.04s)]
*  Now that this judge has thrown out the ruling, effective immediately nationwide, well, that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=101.98s)]
*  timing has to factor into the government's decision as to whether or not to appeal. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=107.92s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=112.8s)]
*  By the time they've brought the appeal, May 3rd probably will have come and gone, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=113.8s)]
*  which means the extension that the judge ruled against would effectively be moot. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=117.68s)]
*  Given the timing here, it has been an open question and an interesting one as to whether [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=123.84s)]
*  the Justice Department would try and appeal. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, today, the Justice Department gave an answer to that question. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=129.4s)]
*  Quote, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=132.56s)]
*  So, the DOJ is trying to reinforce that the CDC has the authority to set rules for public health. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=138.48s)]
*  They're trying to give CDC room to continue assessing whether a mask rule is a valid exercise [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=142.32s)]
*  of the authority Congress has given CDC to protect the public health. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=146.32s)]
*  That's an important authority the Department will continue to work to preserve. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=150.32s)]
*  If CDC concludes that a mandatory order remains necessary for the public's health after that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=154.32s)]
*  assessment, the Department of Justice will appeal the district court's decision. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  So, the DOJ is trying to reinforce that the CDC has the authority to set rules for public health. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=164.32000000000002s)]
*  They're trying to give CDC room to continue assessing whether a mask rule is needed, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  whether it's still a necessary public health measure. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  But when it comes to the bigger, potentially existential question of whether the CDC has [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  the authority to put public health rules in place in the middle of a pandemic, is that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  question still open as long as this judge's ruling goes unchallenged? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  And what does that mean for doctors and nurses treating patients as the number of COVID [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  patients? Joining us now is Dr. Craig Spencer. He's the Director of Global Health and Emergency [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=193.12s)]
*  Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. He's also an emergency room doctor [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=196.72s)]
*  practicing in New York City. He's also a doctor with personal experience with scary contagious [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=201.68s)]
*  diseases. He was the first person in New York City to be diagnosed with Ebola back in 2014 after he [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=206.96s)]
*  returned from treating Ebola patients in Africa. When the COVID pandemic in New York City hit in [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=212.4s)]
*  March 2020, Dr. Spencer was on the front lines treating patients at the very worst of that time. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=219.28s)]
*  Dr. Spencer, it's a real pleasure to have you back on the show. Thanks for making time to be [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=224.48s)]
*  here with us tonight. Thank you for having me back on. It's a pleasure. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=227.6s)]
*  So it seems to me that there's two things to think about in terms of this judge's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=232.72s)]
*  ruling. One is just the practical question. People may be watching you right now with [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  your experience as a specialist in this field, as a practicing physician in New York. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  Is it a good idea to wear a mask on the train, on the subway, on an airplane, even if I'm no longer [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  required? But also, what's your view on this challenge to the CDC, the authority to put a [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  rule like this in place at all? Well, those are incredibly important questions. And I will add [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=259.84s)]
*  that not only as a provider, but as a parent of a three-year-old and a one-year-old who three days [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=265.76s)]
*  ago took a flight to visit family and has to fly back home to New York City in a few days. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=271.04s)]
*  Under these new rules, it does give me some trepidation. My three-year-old and one-year-old, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=276.32s)]
*  one can wear a mask, but they're both unvaccinated. The one-year-old can't. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=281.04s)]
*  And so it does give me some pause and some worry. I would have preferred that they were on a flight [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=284.08s)]
*  where people were masked. But we're going to have to adapt, and we're going to have to think about [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=288.0s)]
*  how to keep ourselves safe. But my most recent flight before that was with my family to go down [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=292.88s)]
*  and visit immunocompromised family members in Florida. And so I'm just worried that there's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=297.92s)]
*  going to be a lot of people in similar situations that will be exposed and may expose others. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=301.76s)]
*  For myself personally, I'm young, I'm healthy, I've been triple vaccinated. My personal risk [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=306.4s)]
*  isn't high. But the risk to others that I might in fact or to my kids may be. And that's for the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  personal and for the family risk. Now, for the more important, I think, legal precedent, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=316.88s)]
*  what you saw here was not a public health decision. You had a legal decision that overrode the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=321.68s)]
*  decisions of a public health authority in the middle of a pandemic. And I'm not just worried [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=328.56s)]
*  about what that means right now, today, for flights in the next few days and for the uptick in cases. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=333.12s)]
*  I'm worried about what that means for the future when we respond to pandemics, when we have further [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=338.88s)]
*  pathogens that threaten us here in the U.S. We've already had dozens of states implement [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=344.48s)]
*  measures to limit public health authority. Now you have a single judge in one state who has [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=349.6s)]
*  overrode a decision by the central public health decision-making authority. And I think that's such [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=355.36s)]
*  a bad precedent. And I'm glad to see the administration challenging that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=361.44s)]
*  And the administration says they will challenge it provided that the CDC assesses in scientific [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=365.68s)]
*  terms that a continued mask mandate, that a continued mask rule for public transit [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=372.56s)]
*  actually is in the public health interest. And so they're effectively, the Justice Department [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=378.0s)]
*  is effectively saying that they're going to follow the science, that if the CDC still thinks [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=383.12s)]
*  this type of rule should be in effect, then they will appeal the ruling in order to try to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=387.36s)]
*  reassert the CDC's authority to make those decisions. It still does feel a little [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=393.92s)]
*  precarious in terms of the standing of the CDC to pass these rules in the future. I mean, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=398.32s)]
*  I understand why the DOJ is deferring to them, but that precedential issue you're talking about is real here. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=404.32s)]
*  Absolutely. And also, quite frankly, it's a very confusing point in the pandemic for many people. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=409.12s)]
*  If you are young and you've been vaccinated, you may think that your personal risk is low. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=415.52000000000004s)]
*  And you may say, well, we know that masks work and we know that having them in congregate [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  settings work. What is even the decision that needs to be made here? What is the CDC even looking at? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=424.0s)]
*  We know that right now, VA2, that subvariant, is spreading. We've seen it in New York, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=429.68s)]
*  and we know that it's causing an uptick in cases nationally. We need to better understand what that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=435.04s)]
*  means, not only for local outbreaks, for bigger outbreaks, in places like New York City and in [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  other big cities where they've seen a lot of virus and a lot of vaccination. It hasn't led to a [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=445.36s)]
*  dramatic uptick in hospitalizations, thankfully. I don't see a lot of COVID patients in the ER [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=449.76000000000005s)]
*  right now. We're not admitting a lot. But that's not going to be true for every place in the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=454.8s)]
*  country. So these decisions might seem really difficult and hard to kind of untangle even two [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=459.04s)]
*  years in. But the fact is, is that we are one country with many different subpopulations of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=465.12s)]
*  vaccination, exposure, immunocompromised states, et cetera. That's what makes it so difficult. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=470.72s)]
*  And that's also why it's so important that people have a bit of empathy, even if the pandemic is [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=476.16s)]
*  over for you. It's not for a lot of people, including parents with kids and people who are [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=480.24s)]
*  still immunocompromised and might not have access to the type of care or the medications that they [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=484.96s)]
*  need to stay safe, as everybody else does. Dr. Craig Spencer, Director of Global Health [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=489.68s)]
*  and Emergency Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Dr. Spencer, it's a pleasure [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  to have you here. I am sorry that you guys got stuck in the middle of your round trip, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=500.24s)]
*  with the rules changing in the middle of it. But I hope you enjoy your time away and good luck. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=505.28s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D9ykqjqPjk&t=508.72s)]
