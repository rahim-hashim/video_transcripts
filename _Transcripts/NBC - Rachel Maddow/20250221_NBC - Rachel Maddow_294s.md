# Trump to put Postal Service on the chopping block: report
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU)
*  This one landed like a bomb last night, courtesy of The Washington Post's Jacob Bogage headline. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump expected to take control of USPS' Fire Postal Board, officials say. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=7.28s)]
*  Quote, Trump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as this week to fire the members [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  of the Postal Service's governing board and place the agency under the control of the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=16.86s)]
*  Commerce Department and Secretary Howard Letnick. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  The board is planning to fight Trump's order, three sources told The Washington Post, in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=24.04s)]
*  an emergency meeting Thursday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=29.46s)]
*  The board retained outside counsel and gave instructions to sue the White House if the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=31.18s)]
*  president were to remove members of the board or attempted to alter the agency's independent [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=36.1s)]
*  status. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  After the Post broke that exclusive story last night, the White House then denied that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=43.06s)]
*  Trump was planning to issue any such executive order. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=47.5s)]
*  Then today, when the Commerce Secretary Letnick was being sworn in, Trump was asked about [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=50.7s)]
*  for the 250-year-old agency whose existence is spelled out in the Constitution. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=55.94s)]
*  He said that he and Secretary Letnick are, quote, looking at it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=61.46s)]
*  Joining us now is the reporter who broke the story, The Washington Post's Jacob Bogage. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=66.26s)]
*  Mr. Bogage, thank you for coming back. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=70.82s)]
*  I knew, had a feeling we'd be back talking to you soon as you continue to break story [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=72.26s)]
*  after story in Washington. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=77.1s)]
*  What's your understanding of the state of play around this Postal Service controversy? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=79.02s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=83.14s)]
*  It's good to be back. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=84.89999999999999s)]
*  And that was one heck of an intro. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  The state of play is in flux. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=90.5s)]
*  Like you mentioned, we reported the story with anonymous but pretty ironclad sourcing. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  The White House, after it published, denied it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=99.97999999999999s)]
*  And then President Trump today didn't just say that he and Secretary Letnick were looking [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  at it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=106.9s)]
*  They were planning what he called some sort of merger between the Postal Service and the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=108.54s)]
*  Commerce Department. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=114.26s)]
*  So this is very much an active question in the White House. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=115.26s)]
*  And at the Postal Service, people are really uncertain. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=119.7s)]
*  That goes from rank and file letter carriers and postmasters who I've talked to today and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  have been texting with all through the night, really, from last night when I broke that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=131.9s)]
*  story to today, to folks in the senior leadership who are wondering what it means to have a [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=136.66s)]
*  political mail service. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=144.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I remember during the first Trump term when Trump was taking aim at the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=146.94s)]
*  Postal Service and there was like a grassroots, legit bottom up uprising around the country, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=152.94s)]
*  even in the worst of covid, with people standing up for postal workers and people standing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=160.26s)]
*  up for the Postal Service and saying hands off. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=164.98s)]
*  And it did appear to back them off. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=167.42s)]
*  My sense, given the approval ratings, the public approval ratings for the Postal Service, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=170.17999999999998s)]
*  that recent experience of having to stand up for it against Trump trying to take it down, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=174.78s)]
*  that the response to your reporting might have been a little bit of that dynamic still at [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=179.73999999999998s)]
*  play, that they might not understand the political dragon that they are sort of letting out of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=184.42s)]
*  the gate here if they try to do this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=189.94s)]
*  Is it your sense that there was momentum to do a thing and then the public revelation of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=192.98s)]
*  that momentum seems to have changed them to a different course? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=197.78s)]
*  That's a difficult question to answer. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=202.57999999999998s)]
*  I mean, yes and no. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=205.38s)]
*  Right. I mean, the story published last night and one of my sources immediately texted me, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  are we doing this again? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  This is somebody who had defended the Postal Service during the first Trump administration [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=217.54s)]
*  and was like, OK, let's take the playbook out again. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=223.45999999999998s)]
*  And I've been talking with sources who are reviving that playbook again today. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  The legal questions around. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=234.26s)]
*  If the Trump administration can do this and if so, how they can do this are very thorny. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=237.62s)]
*  I mean, like I'm a postal policy geek and I don't know. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=244.26s)]
*  And that's because it's an independent agency. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=249.62s)]
*  It has to have a board. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=251.66s)]
*  If you don't have a board, you can't raise prices. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=253.26s)]
*  You can't sell stuff off. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=255.94s)]
*  You can't make investments. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  Those are those are things. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=259.5s)]
*  Those are powers that are not vested in the postmaster general. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=260.74s)]
*  And it's designed that way specifically to wall people's mail and communications off [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=264.5s)]
*  from anyone political who could tinker with it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VcLKtq9NCU&t=271.46s)]
