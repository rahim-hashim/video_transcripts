# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 31
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk)
*  How's this for a coincidence? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=0.0s)]
*  The actual arraignment Tuesday afternoon is scheduled to happen in a courtroom on the [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=2.0s)]
*  15th floor of the criminal court building in lower Manhattan in New York City. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=5.96s)]
*  It will be in a room of that courthouse with a very specific kind of resonance for former [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=11.88s)]
*  President Donald Trump. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=16.36s)]
*  Because in 2021, Donald Trump's business was charged with a whole slew of criminal fraud [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=18.22s)]
*  charges. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=24.56s)]
*  And that trial took place not only in the same courthouse where Trump is set to be [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  arraigned, but the trial for his organization, the trial for his company was held literally [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=30.32s)]
*  in the exact same courtroom where we believe Trump is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=36.16s)]
*  Same room, same place. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=41.4s)]
*  In that trial, Trump's business was found guilty, among other things, of falsifying [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=43.76s)]
*  business records, which is at least reportedly one of the same charges that Trump himself [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=49.08s)]
*  is going to face in his criminal trial, which again will happen in the exact same room. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=53.78s)]
*  It's going to be a trip down memory lane for the former president on Tuesday. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=59.7s)]
*  He's going to step into that courtroom to face charges of falsifying business records [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  where his own business was just convicted of falsifying business records just a few [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=66.86s)]
*  months ago. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=72.42s)]
*  It will also be familiar to his lawyer, Trump's lawyer in this case, Susan Necklis. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=73.42s)]
*  She's the same lawyer who defended Trump's business in that criminal trial last year. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=77.94s)]
*  That did not go well for the defense. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=83.1s)]
*  There were convictions on all counts. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=84.61999999999999s)]
*  But who knows? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=87.82s)]
*  Maybe that was a dry run for her. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=88.82s)]
*  Maybe the first Trump business fraud trial helped prepare her for this next Trump fraud [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=89.82s)]
*  trial. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=95.06s)]
*  What kind of defense should we expect to hear, though, against these kinds of charges? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=97.02s)]
*  I suggested yesterday that we should expect this trial, based on what kind of charges [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=101.13999999999999s)]
*  we think are going to be brought here, we should expect this trial to be very boring. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=105.34s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=109.74s)]
*  What should we, the public, be paying attention to as this kind of trial plays out? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=111.58s)]
*  Joining us now is a man who knows. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=116.06s)]
*  His name is Mark Agnifilo. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=117.53999999999999s)]
*  He's a former assistant Manhattan District Attorney, same DA's office bringing these [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=119.38s)]
*  charges against Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=122.88s)]
*  He's also a former federal prosecutor. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=123.88s)]
*  And also, he has quite recently defended clients in court who've been charged with falsifying [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=125.9s)]
*  business records. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=131.5s)]
*  These same charges were expecting to be brought against Mr. Trump. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=132.5s)]
*  Mr. Agnifilo, thank you so much for being here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=136.54s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=138.26s)]
*  Oh, thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=139.26s)]
*  I really appreciate it, too. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=140.26s)]
*  So, I'm not a lawyer, and I know this is not going to be the Gwyneth Paltrow case. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=141.94s)]
*  I know there's not going to be cameras in the courtroom and us following it in that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=147.06s)]
*  kind of a way. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=150.06s)]
*  But for those of us, and I think a lot of Americans who are going to be following this [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=151.06s)]
*  case closely, should we expect a falsifying business records case, by definition, to be [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=154.82s)]
*  boring and or hard to follow? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=161.54s)]
*  Or is this the sort of thing that we lay observers are going to be able to understand? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=164.64s)]
*  So, the charge itself is really fairly simple. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=169.34s)]
*  There has to be a business record that's been falsified. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=172.5s)]
*  For the trial to involve felony charges, there has to be a second intent to intend to commit [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=176.10000000000002s)]
*  another crime. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=182.08s)]
*  So the charges are pretty boring. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  I don't know that any trial with Michael Cohen as a witness is going to be all that boring. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=185.3s)]
*  But the charges are really fairly pared down. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=190.3s)]
*  There's not a lot for the DA's office to have to prove. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=193.02s)]
*  They have to prove that there was a business record. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=197.36s)]
*  It was false. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=199.22s)]
*  And that there was a secondary intention to commit some other crime. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=201.02s)]
*  They don't have to prove that another crime was committed or even attempted, just that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=205.74s)]
*  there was an intent to do that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=211.14s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=213.34s)]
*  And to be clear, we don't know what the exact charges are. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=214.34s)]
*  There is reporting about the number of charges. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=217.42s)]
*  There is some reporting from the Associated Press about there being at least one felony [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=219.68s)]
*  charge among the... [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  But again, we don't know. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=224.9s)]
*  We'll know for sure when we see the indictment unsealed. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=226.78s)]
*  But in the absence of that specific information, what do you think that we should expect? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=229.82s)]
*  If it is something along the lines that people are proposing or supposing, that it's going [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=235.0s)]
*  to be somewhere between two dozen and three dozen charges, a single felony or a small [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=239.64s)]
*  number of felonies among a larger number of charges that aren't felonies, what would you [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=245.24s)]
*  expect in terms of the kind of timeline for a trial like this to spool out? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=249.76s)]
*  So, I've had quite a number of these trials. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=255.98s)]
*  The DA's office brings these counts all the time. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=259.86s)]
*  What I tend to see, I don't know if we're going to see this in this case, is there'll [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=262.94s)]
*  be some overarching either conspiracy count or a scheme to defraud count, and then the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=266.7s)]
*  individual false business record counts would be part and parcel of those larger counts. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=273.34s)]
*  I don't know that that's what they're going to do here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=279.14s)]
*  They don't have to do that here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=282.1s)]
*  It's unusual, though, in my experience, to see these false business records counts without [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=284.2s)]
*  an overarching usually felony, usually some type of larceny scheme or scheme to defraud [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=291.68s)]
*  or some sort of conspiracy. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=300.72s)]
*  And then the business record counts are sort of part of those larger counts. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  So we'll all have to see. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=307.32s)]
*  We're all speculating. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=309.08s)]
*  What is that second crime? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=310.08s)]
*  Is it an election type crime? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=312.36s)]
*  Is it something else? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  And we won't know until the indictment's unsealed. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  Mark, let me ask you about one other aspect of this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  I was struck. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=323.22s)]
*  The New York Times has a justice correspondent named Charlie Savage who's really smart and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=324.22s)]
*  I think sees around corners a lot of times. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=328.18s)]
*  I've followed his work for a really long time. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=330.22s)]
*  And one of the things that he sort of contended and got some expert advice on today in The [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=332.06s)]
*  Times was the idea that even though this is the first indictment of Donald Trump, there [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=338.14000000000004s)]
*  are a couple of other active criminal investigations that could result in criminal charges against [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=343.58s)]
*  him in other jurisdictions, including potentially federally. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  And what Charlie Savage was suggesting at The Times is that even though this might be [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=352.53999999999996s)]
*  the first indictment, the way the New York courts work, particularly around white collar [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=355.97999999999996s)]
*  offenses like this, this might not be the first one that actually ends up in trial in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=361.26s)]
*  front of a jury because he suggested that in the New York court system, the courts are [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  essentially set up to deal with a lot of pretrial appeals, a lot of pretrial motions, a lot [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=372.42s)]
*  of things that could delay the actual start of the trial. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=377.34s)]
*  And if Donald Trump finds himself federally indicted or indicted in Georgia, one of those [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  things might get to trial first. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=384.58s)]
*  Do you think that seems like a fair contention given your experience in the New York courts [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=386.86s)]
*  with charges like this? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=390.34s)]
*  It's certainly possible. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=392.14s)]
*  I mean, one of the things, one of the features about New York state practice that you don't [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=393.14s)]
*  have federally is you have meaningful motions against the grand jury proceedings themselves. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=397.82s)]
*  You don't really have that in federal court. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=404.74s)]
*  So Trump's lawyer is going to be able to argue to Judge Marshawn, hey, the evidence they [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  put in the grand jury is legally insufficient. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=412.98s)]
*  This indictment should be dismissed. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=415.2s)]
*  In the federal courts, the grand jury is this black box. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=417.5s)]
*  You don't get to see into it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=420.06s)]
*  In New York state courts, you do. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=421.7s)]
*  And so the motion practice in state courts a little more important, a little more involved. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=423.58000000000004s)]
*  And as a result, it's a longer timeline of motions. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=429.8s)]
*  So I would expect this trial to be maybe a year from now. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=433.38s)]
*  I think everyone's going to be watching it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=439.52000000000004s)]
*  I think Judge Marshawn is not going to want it to just linger. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=441.94s)]
*  But a year is probably a safe guess in terms of a timeline. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=446.72s)]
*  Multiple cases very often get to trial sooner than that, sometimes six months, eight months. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=450.54s)]
*  So if there is a federal indictment of Trump in the next, say, month or two, it's possible [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=456.26000000000005s)]
*  that case would get to trial before this one. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=462.62s)]

*  President Spiro Agnew to the end of his political history. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1006.98s)]
*  Ron, thank you for your time and expertise tonight. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1010.8199999999999s)]
*  It's always good to see you. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1012.86s)]
*  Good to see you too. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1013.86s)]
*  Today is Trans Day of Visibility, a day for honoring the contributions of trans people [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1016.46s)]
*  and acknowledging the discrimination they face in our country. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1021.58s)]
*  President Biden marked the day today with a proclamation from the White House, and the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1024.58s)]
*  White House posted this from him online, quote, on Transgender Day of Visibility, we want [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1028.14s)]
*  you to know that we see you just as you are, made in the image of God and deserving of [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1032.0600000000002s)]
*  dignity, respect and support. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1036.94s)]
*  We'll never stop working to create a world where you won't have to be brave just to be [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1039.18s)]
*  yourself. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1044.1000000000001s)]
*  But for trans people in our country this year, so much depends on who controls the state [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1045.1000000000001s)]
*  government where you live. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1049.7s)]
*  In Minnesota, Democrats control the state house, the state Senate and the governorship [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1052.18s)]
*  right now, and they're passing legislation now to effectively make Minnesota a refuge [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1056.0s)]
*  for trans people who travel there seeking, among other things, medical care. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1061.1599999999999s)]
*  In Nebraska, Democrats are in the minority there, but those Democrats have been using [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1066.72s)]
*  what power they have, even in the minority, to filibuster every single bill. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1070.6599999999999s)]
*  They're filibustering every single bill in the legislature just to try to stop Republicans [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1075.56s)]
*  from going after trans kids. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1081.1s)]
*  And look, here's news tonight from Tennessee, another state where Republicans control the [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1084.36s)]
*  government. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1088.56s)]
*  In Tennessee, Republicans spent the day today waiting for their new ban on drag to take [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1089.56s)]
*  effect at midnight tonight. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1094.12s)]
*  Nice timing, guys. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1096.04s)]
*  Thanks to a Republican-passed law, as of midnight tonight it was set to become illegal in Tennessee [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1097.7199999999998s)]
*  to have a drag performance anywhere a minor might conceivably be present, which of course [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1102.9199999999998s)]
*  is anywhere. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1108.24s)]
*  Repeat offenses could put you in prison for up to six years. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1110.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, we can report right now that Tennessee Republicans are going to be waiting longer [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1114.2s)]
*  than midnight for that because tonight, since we have been on the air, a federal judge has [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1117.84s)]
*  put a hold on that new law. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1122.24s)]
*  Judge Thomas Parker is a Trump appointee. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1124.1200000000001s)]
*  He wrote this in his ruling, quote, within our country's federal framework, states are [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1126.72s)]
*  laboratories of democracy that can test laws and policies enacted by the people. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1130.78s)]
*  Even still, these experiments are not without constraints. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1136.1200000000001s)]
*  The U.S. Constitution, a law that is supreme even to the Tennessee General Assembly's [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1139.32s)]
*  acts, has placed some issues beyond the reach of the democratic process. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1143.36s)]
*  First among them is freedom of speech. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1147.96s)]
*  If Tennessee wishes to exercise its police power in restricting speech it considers obscene, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1150.1599999999999s)]
*  it must do so within the constraints and framework of the U.S. Constitution. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1156.08s)]
*  This court finds that as it stands, the record here suggests that when the legislature passed [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1160.12s)]
*  this statute, it missed the mark. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1164.96s)]
*  Again, the Tennessee ban on drag was supposed to take effect tonight at midnight, but it [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1169.12s)]
*  will now be on hold while this federal legal challenge plays out. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZp3uqRvFk&t=1175.32s)]
