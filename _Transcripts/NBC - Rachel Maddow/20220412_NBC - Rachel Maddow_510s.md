# Samantha Power On Russian Atrocities And 'Genocide': 'The Facts Are Plain As Day'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg)
*  Administrator Samantha Power joins us live now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=0.0s)]
*  Madam Administrator, thank you so much for being here. It's really nice to see you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=2.64s)]
*  Good to see you, Rachel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=7.36s)]
*  So, President Biden did use the word genocide when describing the situation in Ukraine. He used that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=9.76s)]
*  word for the first time today. I want to get your perspective on what that means. For a U.S. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=14.88s)]
*  president to use that word, does that change the U.S. posture in this conflict? Does it change our [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=21.12s)]
*  perceived responsibilities? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=26.8s)]
*  Well, let me just say that from the beginning of the war, we've seen two things. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=30.8s)]
*  Extraordinary brutality. And I say that as somebody, as you said, who's studied mass [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=35.92s)]
*  atrocities and genocide over time. I mean, I didn't think I was capable of being [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=41.36s)]
*  shocked by the actions of violent, brutal leaders and their coldness to human life. But [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=47.6s)]
*  even though we warned that a lot of this was coming when you see mothers digging their sons [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=55.68s)]
*  out of wells or you see bodies being burnt to hide evidence or just to destroy the will of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  families who have to watch it happen. I mean, it is searing. What is happening is grotesque [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  and horrific. At the same time, from the very beginning of the war, in part because Putin [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=73.92s)]
*  projected at least some of his intentions in terms of launching the military invasion and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=80.24s)]
*  being willing to target civilians and leaders and journalists and NGO [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  professionals. We've been working with the Ukrainians to help document the atrocities [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  underway, which started on day one when they began hitting residential areas and hospitals [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=100.24s)]
*  and the like. So in terms of the formal legal determination, inevitably that is going to occur [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=106.72s)]
*  in a courtroom or through an elaborate legal process where we gather testimonies, combine [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=114.32s)]
*  it with intelligence, where we can show intent to destroy a national ethnic or religious group [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  as such, in this case, a national group, as the president said, that will come. But I think what [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=126.72s)]
*  the president was speaking to is to what we all see with our own eyes, which is it's intentionally [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=131.12s)]
*  trying to wipe out Ukrainians because they are Ukrainians. And I think that was why that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=136.72s)]
*  determination by him was made. But he was the first to say, look, we have a process. We're building [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=142.88s)]
*  toward the UN Commission of Inquiry that's been set up. The International Criminal Court has [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=147.76s)]
*  announced that it's opening an investigation. So there'll be plenty of venues to gather everything [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=153.84s)]
*  in one place and run through this. But the facts of what we see every day and above all, what the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=158.24s)]
*  Ukrainians are experiencing every day are plain as day. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=163.36s)]
*  Do you honestly think that he cares about being accused of war crimes, that he sees any [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=166.4s)]
*  realistic threat of being held accountable for some type of warfare that might be described [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=172.72s)]
*  as criminal as opposed to the war itself, which arguably is criminal as a whole? I mean, it just, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=178.24s)]
*  it feels like almost an academic determination at this point, especially for a dictator who [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=184.96s)]
*  doesn't ever plan on leaving power. You know, it's a fair question for sure, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=190.24s)]
*  because we see the kind of culture of impunity that he's embedded himself in for a very long time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  We see the long table and the yes men and the sycophants and anybody who [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  raises a voice of dissent, whether on TV or in his inner circle, you know, we don't see them again. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  So I hear you, but I just offer a personal reflection on that question, which is I got [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=217.84s)]
*  my start in Bosnia as a kid reporter documenting some of these crimes on the ground, not with an [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=224.88s)]
*  eye to legal determinations, but just as a simple freelance war correspondent. And I can say, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=230.88s)]
*  having interacted with the big guys of that time, the brutal war criminals of that time, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=238.4s)]
*  the Rako Mladic, the Slobodan Milosevic, the Radovan Karadzic, names that people aren't really [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=244.24s)]
*  talking about anymore, but they carried themselves in the same way. They sat at those long tables. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  They cut people off the air who offered dissenting views. They only surround themselves with yes men. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  Oh, you're so smart, President Milosevic. You're so this, you're so that. And I never dreamed [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=262.16s)]
*  that history would turn and that these three individuals would end up in the Hague, and nor [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  did the victims of their atrocities. So it isn't to say that inevitably history will repeat itself, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=274.0s)]
*  but it is to say that history is long. And sadly, you know, this war, every day that this war goes [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  on seven weeks, every day that the circle of economic consequences combined with the prospect [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=287.04s)]
*  of the sword of Damocles in a legal sense or in a judicial accountability sense, every day that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=294.32s)]
*  that doesn't impact Putin's calculus in the here and now is one day too many. So we all understand [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=299.04s)]
*  that. But I think to think that just because he's at a long table now and looking like he is standing [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=305.36s)]
*  immune to the consequences of his brutality, I think could prove short-sighted. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  Ukrainian military this week is given unusual warning about Moldova. They warned that Russia, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=320.16s)]
*  they believe Russia may be about to do something in Moldova that they're then going to blame on [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=325.68s)]
*  Ukraine to justify Russia expanding the war and invading that country to basically their warning [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=330.48s)]
*  that Russia is looking for a fake justification to keep moving, to keep expanding the war into [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=336.24s)]
*  into neighboring countries that they've had their eye on for a while. What do you make of those [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=341.52s)]
*  claims from Ukraine and from the overall threat that Putin doesn't even plan on containing this [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=346.4s)]
*  just to Ukraine despite the damage he's already done there? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=351.04s)]
*  Well, again, one would never wish to underestimate either Putin's brutality or [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=356.0s)]
*  the counterproductive decisions he could make in order to set back his own war effort, right? I [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=363.44s)]
*  mean, he is not handled this well and to sort of create another theater when his troops are not [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=368.8s)]
*  managing in the theater that they are in other than committing atrocities. You know, you can't [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=374.16s)]
*  rule that out, but I will tell you the same thing I told the Moldovan president and that President [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=379.52s)]
*  Biden and everyone on the team have conveyed, which is at this point, we see no evidence of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  plans of that nature. And we're watching very carefully. If you're Moldovan and you're in, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  you know, a small country of under three million people, already part of your country has been [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=397.2s)]
*  occupied by Russian forces unjustly. Your sovereignty has been undermined. You should know [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=401.44s)]
*  you're led by an amazing pair of female presidents and prime minister to technocrat, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=406.48s)]
*  anti-corruption reformers who very much want to integrate Moldova into Europe. Putin hates that, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=413.68s)]
*  of course, and they've taken great strides to fight the oligarchs and to fight corruption. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=420.0s)]
*  Putin hates that too. So there is a jitteriness, understandably, in Moldova. And again, we can't [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  rule anything like that out, given that Putin clearly has ambitions to recreate, you know, some [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=431.76s)]
*  world that no longer exists anymore and to impede progress toward European integration [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  for young people and others who want the democratic freedoms, the rule of law [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=444.64s)]
*  that so many of us cherish. And so can't rule it out. Not seeing it at the moment. Certainly [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=451.28s)]
*  our work with the Moldovan government right now is aimed actually at focusing on their economic [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=458.48s)]
*  security and stability because they have lost export markets, import markets. Their fuel prices [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=463.76s)]
*  are up 360 percent, if you can believe it, since the war started. So this is a government that's [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=469.76s)]
*  doing all of the right things. And already the impact of this war, well and apart from any new [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  military dimension to it, is really jeopardizing an incredibly important journey that they are on [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=481.04s)]
*  toward democratic progress. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJzT39ISJQg&t=487.44s)]
