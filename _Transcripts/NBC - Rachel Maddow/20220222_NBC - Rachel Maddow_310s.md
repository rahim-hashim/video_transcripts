# Putin Builds On Past Crimea Invasion To Encroach Further On Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY)
*  In the hallway, there were gunmen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=0.0s)]
*  This was inside a television station in Ukraine on a Thursday morning in May of 2014. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=3.0s)]
*  This was the last video taken by the journalists who worked there before masked men with guns told them they could no longer freely do their jobs. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=10.24s)]
*  The gunmen presented the journalists with this letter saying that their TV station was under new ownership. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=20.48s)]
*  According to these armed men, the TV station in Ukraine now belonged to pro-Russian separatists. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=27.2s)]
*  And they didn't just take the TV station. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=33.68s)]
*  All over eastern Ukraine in 2014, those pro-Russian militiamen took over police stations, government buildings, and brick by brick. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=37.2s)]
*  The pro-Russian separatists took control of two entire cities in Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=48.0s)]
*  And they declared themselves independent from the rest of Ukraine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=56.64s)]
*  That's where Vladimir Putin joined the fight. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Those two cities, seized by those pro-Russian rebels, they were located in a part of Ukraine where a lot of Russian speakers live. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=63.52s)]
*  And so on Putin's orders, Russia sent both weapons and their own men into eastern Ukraine to try and fend off the Ukrainian soldiers from taking back those two cities, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=70.68s)]
*  to keep them in the hands of those pro-Russian separatists. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=82.84s)]
*  Now, this has been going on for a while. There have been attempts at ceasefires and peace over the years. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=87.0s)]
*  But the fighting over those two cities in Ukraine has never really stopped. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  More than 14,000 people have died in that conflict since it began. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=96.68s)]
*  And ever since then, those pro-Russian separatists have maintained that they are the ones rightfully in charge of the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces in Ukraine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=103.96s)]
*  Those separatists have kept a military chokehold on a chunk of each of those provinces marked in the map here in pink. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=116.04s)]
*  And it is into that part of the world today, into that active tinderbox, that Vladimir Putin just threw a lit match. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=125.96s)]
*  Today, Vladimir Putin announced that he was recognizing those two parts of Russia controlled by the Russian separatists, Donetsk and Luhansk. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=135.48s)]
*  Putin said that he was officially recognizing those two swaths of Ukraine as independent, independent of Ukraine. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=144.92s)]
*  Again, it should be noted that the separatists do not actually control the entirety of those two regions, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  but Putin has now unilaterally said that it all belongs to them anyway. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=159.08s)]
*  In an hour-long speech, Putin said that Ukraine, a former member of the Soviet Union, was created by Russia. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=165.32s)]
*  He essentially denied the notion that Ukraine has ever been its own legitimate country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=172.44s)]
*  He accused Ukraine, without any evidence, of carrying out a genocide against Russian people. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=176.76s)]
*  He said that Ukraine poses a threat to not just the Russians living in Ukraine, but to all Russians. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=182.04s)]
*  And he said because of that threat, he had no other choice today but to recognize those two separatist-controlled regions as independent, to try and protect Russians. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=189.16s)]
*  Now, immediately after his speech, Putin signed a series of orders and decrees that allowed him to send so-called peacekeeping troops into eastern Ukraine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=202.2s)]
*  Again, for the sake of protecting the Russian people, not Ukrainians. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=211.32s)]
*  The general consensus after Putin's announcement today is that he was not laying out a game plan for protecting Russia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=216.68s)]
*  He was laying out a game plan for war. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=222.44s)]
*  It gives him an excuse to put boots on the ground under the auspices of peace before launching an all-out attack. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=225.48s)]
*  Like when you're a kid, you tricked your parents into letting you sleep over at a friend's house to help them out with their math homework. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=232.04s)]
*  When really you guys just wanted to stay up all night and watch movies. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  You tell them what they want to hear to get what you want, and by the time you get it, it's too late for anyone to do anything about it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=240.76s)]
*  It's a bait and switch. It's been used many times throughout history. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=247.56s)]
*  It's a playbook that is well-worn because it has worked. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=250.28s)]
*  Telling the world he would try to protect persecuted Germans in eastern Europe was how Hitler convinced Chamberlain to give him a chunk of Czechoslovakia. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=255.16s)]
*  He invaded Poland under the same pretext in 1939. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=264.03999999999996s)]
*  That narrative, of course, started to fall apart when Hitler invaded Denmark and Norway and Belgium and France and all those countries. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=267.56s)]
*  But by then it was too late. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=275.96s)]
*  This is not just the strategy that started World War II. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=278.92s)]
*  It's now happening again in real time. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=281.72s)]
*  And this is Putin's big lie. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=283.8s)]
*  Fortunately, most people are seeing right through it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3zWQkUKfVY&t=287.8s)]
