# 'No way to run a democracy': Court advances new attack on Voting Rights Act
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0)
*  First it was Alabama. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=0.0s)]
*  Surprise Supreme Court win for black voters. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=1.6s)]
*  Soon it was also Georgia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=5.24s)]
*  And then it was Louisiana, too. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=7.54s)]
*  All states where major court decisions called [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=10.08s)]
*  for the drawing of new congressional maps [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  that would give black voters a chance at fair representation [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  after Republican legislators drew up districts [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=18.12s)]
*  that deliberately locked black voters out [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=20.62s)]
*  of any reasonable chance of electing the legislators [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=22.8s)]
*  of their choice. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=25.5s)]
*  These were all states where voters [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=26.86s)]
*  and voting rights groups were able to sue [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=29.04s)]
*  to get fair representation for black voters. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=31.74s)]
*  And they were able to win. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=35.019999999999996s)]
*  They won surprising, meaningful, consequential victories [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=36.28s)]
*  for black voters thanks to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=40.96s)]
*  The cases appeared to open a path toward undoing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=45.8s)]
*  racially discriminatory congressional maps of the past. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=49.46s)]
*  State by state, one by one. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=53.44s)]
*  Until now, until today. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=57.2s)]
*  Today a panel of three federal judges, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=59.8s)]
*  all appointed by Republicans, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=61.54s)]
*  issued a decision in a case that was brought [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=63.98s)]
*  by the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=65.84s)]
*  It challenges the fairness of congressional maps there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=68.74s)]
*  And these judges in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=72.34s)]
*  they ruled that private citizens, private entities, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=76.02s)]
*  private groups can't bring these cases anymore. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=80.12s)]
*  Can't bring the kind of cases that we have seen succeed [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=83.42s)]
*  in Alabama and Georgia and Louisiana and other states. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=86.72s)]
*  The judges ruled that entities, private entities, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=90.36s)]
*  can't bring those kinds of cases. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=93.3s)]
*  Actually, the only entity that can bring [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=95.2s)]
*  that kind of a case is the United States Attorney General. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=97.06s)]
*  And if you can't get the United States Attorney General [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=102.78s)]
*  to bring a case like this on your behalf, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=105.78s)]
*  then what happens in your state? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=107.94s)]
*  And what happens to the cases [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=110.24s)]
*  that have been decided already? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=111.34s)]
*  What happens to other states where voters want [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=112.88s)]
*  to challenge a racially discriminatory gerrymander [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  of the congressional maps? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  How long before this case gets [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  to the United States Supreme Court [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=123.38s)]
*  and what's gonna happen when it gets there? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=124.78s)]
*  The headline in the New York Times tonight [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=126.92s)]
*  is federal court moves to drastically weaken [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=128.57999999999998s)]
*  Voting Rights Act. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=131.72s)]
*  Past in 1965, the Voting Rights Act [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=134.12s)]
*  was one of the most significant achievements [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=135.92s)]
*  of the civil rights movement, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=137.42s)]
*  undoing decades of discriminatory Jim Crow laws [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=138.6s)]
*  and protecting against egregious racial gerrymanders. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=141.62s)]
*  But the law has been under legal assault [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=145.62s)]
*  almost since its inception. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=147.46s)]
*  Today, a federal appeals court moved [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=149.5s)]
*  to drastically weaken it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  Should today's ruling stand, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=153.24s)]
*  it would remove perhaps the most important facet [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=155.04s)]
*  of the Voting Rights Act. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=158.1s)]
*  The majority of challenges to discriminatory laws [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=159.6s)]
*  have come from private citizens and civil rights groups. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=162.34s)]
*  Joining us now is Janay Nelson. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=166.54s)]
*  She's president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=167.92s)]
*  Ms. Nelson, thanks very much for joining us, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=171.14000000000001s)]
*  especially on short notice [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=172.78s)]
*  with this surprise ruling tonight. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=173.94s)]
*  Happy to be here, Rachel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=176.48s)]
*  So let me just ask you, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=178.58s)]
*  I feel like for the last 10 years [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=181.02s)]
*  since the Supreme Court ruling in 2013, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=184.02s)]
*  that really took a lot of the power [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=186.36s)]
*  of the Voting Rights Act away, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=189.36s)]
*  we have been talking about this landmark piece [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  of legislation, this sort of moral crucible piece [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=193.8s)]
*  of American legislation, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=197.04s)]
*  as having been severely weakened. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  What is important about tonight's ruling [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=201.12s)]
*  as compared to the other attacks on the Voting Rights Act [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=204.8s)]
*  that we've seen from this conservative court? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=207.5s)]
*  Well, tonight's ruling upends almost 60 years [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  of precedent in which, as you noted, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=214.78s)]
*  individuals and civil rights groups [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=216.84s)]
*  have enforced section two of the Voting Rights Act [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=218.82000000000002s)]
*  to make sure that our country has a democracy [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  that is free from racial discrimination. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  It's something that we've never fully achieved, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  but the Voting Rights Act and section two in particular [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=229.3s)]
*  has done such muscular work to advance us toward this goal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=232.36s)]
*  And this is the first decision to say unequivocally [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  that individuals and civil rights groups [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=242.06s)]
*  like the Legal Defense Fund cannot bring lawsuits [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=244.28s)]
*  under this key provision. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=248.12s)]
*  And it's interesting that you bring up [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  Shelby County versus Holder, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  which as you noted 10 years ago, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=253.06s)]
*  gutted what was the most transformative provision [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  of the Voting Rights Act, section five. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=257.34000000000003s)]
*  And in that decision, Chief Justice Roberts [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=259.5s)]
*  in striking down that key part of the Voting Rights Act [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=262.24s)]
*  pointed to section two and said, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=265.42s)]
*  you can still use section two to vindicate your rights. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=267.62s)]
*  There's still a vehicle to address racial discrimination [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=270.5s)]
*  in our elections. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=273.5s)]
*  And yet a panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=274.74s)]
*  in this country said no, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=278.26s)]
*  individuals, individual voters, citizens, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=280.4s)]
*  civil rights groups, good government groups [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=283.48s)]
*  who have brought litigation under section two [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=285.6s)]
*  for decades now can no longer do that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=287.94s)]
*  And the only possible vehicle [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=290.56s)]
*  is through the Department of Justice [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=294.12s)]
*  and the US Attorney General. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  That is woefully inadequate for so many reasons. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=297.52s)]
*  Not only does DOJ have limited resources [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=300.6s)]
*  and limited time and limited bandwidth, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=302.68s)]
*  as we know, not every Department of Justice is the same. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=305.71999999999997s)]
*  And in the last administration, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=308.70000000000005s)]
*  we saw voting rights suits come to a screeching halt. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=310.66s)]
*  In fact, the Legal Defense Fund had to step in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=315.26000000000005s)]
*  and effectively be a Department of Justice [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=317.18s)]
*  during that period of that administration. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=319.98s)]
*  We can't allow our voting rights [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=322.74s)]
*  to depend on the political whims or machinations [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=325.06s)]
*  of a particular administration. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=329.0s)]
*  Individual citizens deserve the right [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=330.58000000000004s)]
*  to vindicate the right to vote, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=332.90000000000003s)]
*  which is so fundamental to our democracy. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=334.76000000000005s)]
*  Thinking about the movements on the right, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=337.94s)]
*  both in and outside of the legal system [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=342.2s)]
*  that have sort of brought us to this place today, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=344.56s)]
*  it's hard not to, I think, ascribe the worst motives [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=348.84s)]
*  to this assault on the Voting Rights Act. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=352.52s)]
*  I mean, the Voting Rights Act is designed [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=354.2s)]
*  to remove racial discrimination from the voting system. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=356.08s)]
*  If you are trying to get rid of the Voting Rights Act, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=358.44s)]
*  you are trying to get rid of protections [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=360.44s)]
*  against racial discrimination in voting. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=362.08s)]
*  And it's very hard to get away [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=364.32s)]
*  from that simple fundamental truth of it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=365.94s)]
*  But when it comes to this particular part [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=368.62s)]
*  of the way the Voting Rights Act works, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=370.74s)]
*  Section 2, which as you say, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=372.9s)]
*  allows groups like the Legal Defense Fund, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=374.3s)]
*  allows groups, individual groups, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=376.06s)]
*  allows other voting rights groups to bring these cases, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=377.86s)]
*  to test whether or not voting provisions [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=381.06s)]
*  are racially discriminatory. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=383.7s)]
*  Is there some beef that the right has with that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=385.65999999999997s)]
*  in particulars? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=388.18s)]
*  Is there some case that they feel like is particularly wrong? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=389.26s)]
*  Or there's something that they think [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  has been egregiously mishandled [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=393.78s)]
*  in the way that Section 2 has been operative [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=396.2s)]
*  in states across the country [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=399.12s)]
*  as for all the decades that this has been in place? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=400.44s)]
*  You know, what's fascinating Rachel is that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=403.96000000000004s)]
*  we've brought suits against Democrats and Republicans. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=405.76s)]
*  We are a nonpartisan organization. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  We enforce Section 2 and all other provisions [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=411.12s)]
*  of the Voting Rights Act on behalf of voters [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=414.0s)]
*  to ensure that no matter who the actor is, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  no matter what party they might be affiliated with, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=418.88s)]
*  that they don't trample on that fundamental right. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  So really there's no reason to cast this in partisan terms. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  There's no reason for any party [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=428.36s)]
*  to feel that the Voting Rights Act [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=430.92s)]
*  is not a fair exercise of congressional authority [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  to ensure that the 14th and 15th amendments [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  of our constitution are honored [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=439.52s)]
*  when we talk about this critical right [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=442.08s)]
*  that undergirds our entire democracy. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  But of course, if you are prone to manipulating rules, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=446.48s)]
*  manipulating districting lines, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=451.36s)]
*  manipulating elections in every possible way [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=452.94s)]
*  to win against a majority of the people in this country, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=455.62s)]
*  then yes, you might have a beef with the Voting Rights Act, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=460.74s)]
*  but that is no way to run a democracy. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=463.26s)]
*  That is no way to ensure [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=466.46000000000004s)]
*  that all voices are equally heard. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jd20TZiIu0&t=467.74s)]
