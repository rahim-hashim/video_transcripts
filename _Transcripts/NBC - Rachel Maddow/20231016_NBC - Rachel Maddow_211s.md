# Massive voter turnout in Poland appears to reject right-wing party; Halts authoritarian drift
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4)
*  You might have seen, you might not have seen some big news in politics in Europe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=0.0s)]
*  A country that had been flirting with the prospect of maybe giving up their democracy, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=7.36s)]
*  maybe heading toward a more authoritarian form of government, something more like Hungary [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=12.48s)]
*  or even Russia, has decided not to go that way. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=16.8s)]
*  In Poland this weekend, the Polish people turned out in huge, huge numbers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=21.52s)]
*  For 74% voter turnout in Poland, that's bigger turnout than what was previously their most [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=27.36s)]
*  important election ever when they voted out the Communist Party in 1989. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=32.84s)]
*  Polish people turned out this weekend in unprecedentedly gigantic numbers and they voted out the hard [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=38.2s)]
*  right party that had been the governing party there, the so-called law and justice party. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=46.64s)]
*  And so it's just, I mean, whether or not you care about Poland itself and its future, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=53.04s)]
*  it's an important thing for Europe, it's an important thing particularly for, say, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=58.56s)]
*  the European Union's support of Ukraine and Russia's war on Ukraine. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=63.04s)]
*  But it also helps us get our arms around this larger international project that even we [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=68.96s)]
*  in our country are subject to right now, right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=75.24s)]
*  We have seen authoritarian anti-democratic movements and leaders rise all over the world [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=78.2s)]
*  in recent years, including here at home. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=84.52s)]
*  But there has been electoral pushback, some notable electoral pushback in important countries. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=89.32s)]
*  We have seen, for example, Donald Trump voted out of office in this country resoundingly [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=94.8s)]
*  in the United States 2020. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=100.92s)]
*  We saw Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil voted out of power resoundingly in 2022. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=103.08s)]
*  Earlier this year in Spain, we saw the hard right party there rejected unexpectedly by voters. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=108.88s)]
*  And now this weekend, we have just seen Poland's very hard right law and justice party voted out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=116.2s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that there isn't still rising authoritarianism all around the world, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=124.96s)]
*  but it does mean that in instances like these, in big important countries with mature democracies, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=129.08s)]
*  we are seeing big voter pushback against Trump-type or Viktor Orban-type leaders. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=135.84s)]
*  And authoritarians or would-be authoritarians, they don't generally take well to elections [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=142.12s)]
*  voting them out of office. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=147.68s)]
*  That's part of why they try to undermine democracy full stop. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  In the case of both Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, we saw mass violence after they [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  were voted out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=158.08s)]
*  We saw their supporters storming the Capitol to try to keep them in power after they lost election. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=159.08s)]
*  And so eyes are on Poland now for any kind of potential eventuality like that or any [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  other kind of authoritarian rule by force shenanigans to try to undo the Polish election [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=170.4s)]
*  result from this weekend. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=176.68s)]
*  But for now, that is an important result in Europe. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  It looks like another win for small-D Democrats against the admittedly still rising authoritarian tide. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjB2prmcY4&t=181.56s)]
