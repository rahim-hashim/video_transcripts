# Trump backlash drives record wave of first-time interest in running for office
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA)
*  I'll be part of our MSNBC State of the Union coverage starting tomorrow at 8 p.m. Eastern. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=0.0s)]
*  One of the things that still seems quite up in the air is how Democrats are going to handle [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=5.68s)]
*  things tomorrow. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=9.24s)]
*  It seems like several Democratic lawmakers are going to boycott all or part of Trump's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=10.24s)]
*  speech. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=14.68s)]
*  Oregon Senator Ron Wyden says he'll be listening to his constituents in a tele-town hall, which [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=15.68s)]
*  he has scheduled to start at the exact same time that Trump will be starting his speech. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=20.0s)]
*  Washington Senator Patty Murray says she's also not planning on attending. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=25.28s)]
*  Our approach among elected Democrats is to go to the speech but to bring as their guests [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=29.4s)]
*  people who have been fired by Trump or Elon Musk. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=33.64s)]
*  We're also watching for protests. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=36.64s)]
*  Protesters planning to turn out at state capitals around the country tomorrow and also in Washington, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=38.96s)]
*  D.C. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=43.839999999999996s)]
*  Most of the public pushback we've seen in these past six weeks has been directed at [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=44.839999999999996s)]
*  Trump and Elon Musk and Republicans, but some has also been directed at Democrats as people [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  have called on Democratic elected officials to fight harder, to break protocol, do more, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=55.12s)]
*  come up with new and creative ways to do what they can to stop things or at least slow things [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=62.16s)]
*  down or make them more embarrassing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=68.84s)]
*  In the past on this show, we've talked about a grassroots organizing group called Run for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  Something, which encourages progressive Americans to run for political office, particularly [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=75.44s)]
*  if they've never done so before. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=80.88s)]
*  Run for Something says they are now having a run on their services. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=83.36s)]
*  500 to 600 people reaching out every day now to say they want to run for office. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is Amanda Littman. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=93.52s)]
*  She's president and co-founder of Run for Something. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=94.72s)]
*  She's also the author of the forthcoming book When We're In Charge, The Next Generation's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  Guide to Leadership, which comes out in May. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=101.35999999999999s)]
*  Amanda, thanks for being here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=104.28s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=105.28s)]
*  I thought this was a typo. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=106.28s)]
*  500 to 600 people a day? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=107.28s)]
*  It is unprecedented. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=110.32s)]
*  It is a wave of people signing up to run for office that we have not seen since we launched [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=111.72s)]
*  on Trump's first inauguration day back in 2017. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  Bigger now than it was in 2017? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=119.16s)]
*  We have had more people sign up just since election day and in fact, almost just since [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=120.63999999999999s)]
*  inauguration than we did in the entire calendar year of 2017. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=125.32s)]
*  When people sign up with you, what are they signing up for? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=129.26s)]
*  They're saying, I'm thinking about running for local office probably 2025 or 2026. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  Some of them are ready to get on the ballot now. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=138.32s)]
*  We know that the average person stays in our pipeline about 310 days, so we expect [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=140.56s)]
*  many of them to be running in 2026, which is good because 2026 could be a year in which [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=144.68s)]
*  Democrats win really big if we're on the ballot in as many places as possible. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=149.48s)]
*  And how do you help people try to compete? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  So we help people with every step of the process from thinking about what office to actually [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=156.52s)]
*  run for, how to get on the ballot, how to write a campaign plan, how to really connect [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=160.8s)]
*  with their constituents, to knock doors, talk to voters. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=164.6s)]
*  We have an endorsement program that's helped elect almost 1500 millennials in Gen Z in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=167.28s)]
*  the last eight years in nearly every state. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=171.68s)]
*  We are just missing Idaho. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=174.0s)]
*  Idaho. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=175.4s)]
*  Idaho. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=176.4s)]
*  So if you want to run in Idaho, we would love to help you win. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=177.4s)]
*  We have a dedicated audience in Boise. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=178.96s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=181.12s)]
*  Hello, Boise. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=182.12s)]
*  I even know how to pronounce it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=183.12s)]
*  Amanda Liepman is right here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=184.76s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=185.76s)]
*  I pointed out in the intro there that some of the protests that we've been seeing, and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=186.76s)]
*  I'm not even sure if we should call them protests, some of the sort of uprising that we're seeing, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=193.64s)]
*  it's a lot of anger toward Republican elected officials and toward the administration. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  But we are also seeing sort of constructive frustration directed at Democrats to do more, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=200.08s)]
*  come up with better strategies, be louder, be stronger in your opposition. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=207.16s)]
*  Are you seeing any reflection of that in the way that people are reaching out to you at [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=211.4s)]
*  Run for Something? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=214.8s)]
*  No, we're seeing people tell us they want to run because their school boards have banned [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=215.8s)]
*  books and they want to fight back, where they're saying they want to run because the elected [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=218.68s)]
*  official who currently represents them isn't fighting hard enough for them, their kids, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=222.4s)]
*  their community. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=226.4s)]
*  They're saying if I don't do this, I don't think anyone else will. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=227.4s)]
*  And I believe them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=231.12s)]
*  It has been so inspiring to see. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=233.08s)]
*  We looked at a map of where everyone is coming from, every single state, rural, urban, suburban, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  ex-urban, all across the country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=239.56s)]
*  And they're telling us, I feel like no one has my back, so I have to have my own back. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=241.88s)]
*  Last question for you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=247.24s)]
*  Given that feedback that you are getting directly from people coming to you at Run for Something, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=248.76s)]
*  do you feel like you have a sense from looking at that data, from interacting with those [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=254.2s)]
*  people about what the feeling is in the country among people who are frustrated with what's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=258.08s)]
*  going on? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=262.04s)]
*  They're so angry. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=263.04s)]
*  They want their leadership to show a spine. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  They don't want to have to do this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=268.12s)]
*  They feel like they need to because no one else is doing it for them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  Amanda Littman is the president and co-founder of Run for Something. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=273.88s)]
*  Amanda, thank you very much. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=277.4s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=278.4s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=279.4s)]
*  All right, we'll be right back. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=280.4s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=281.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyfx4A32TA&t=284.16s)]
