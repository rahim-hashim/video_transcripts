# 'The end of politics': Rachel Maddow on how to make sense of the new Trump campaign
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc)
*  We're living through an era in our country's political life right now, which is not politics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=0.0s)]
*  And if you want to call it the most romantic possible thing, I think you could call it [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=8.92s)]
*  revolutionary, right? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=12.84s)]
*  Just like gangsterism is a familiar trope for us in our favorite American drama, we [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=14.64s)]
*  also romanticize revolution and revolutionaries as much as any country on earth. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=18.56s)]
*  What we are contending with in our politics right now is a movement that is not doing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=24.619999999999997s)]
*  normal politics and is not competing in normal political terms. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=30.419999999999998s)]
*  They're trying to end the American system of government. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=34.66s)]
*  They're trying to bring about a revolution against the American system of government [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=36.9s)]
*  and against the United States of America. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=40.94s)]
*  And in this story, we're the Americans. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=43.06s)]
*  So yes, being revolutionary sounds very cool in the abstract, just like being gangster [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=45.66s)]
*  sounds very cool in the abstract. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=52.699999999999996s)]
*  But in the specific, what they're actually offering is boring because it's just gross [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=55.54s)]
*  force. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=62.34s)]
*  It's the end of politics. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=65.38s)]
*  Let's just let's just do it by force, because physically we mean it just the way we say [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=66.46s)]
*  we were saying it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=72.86s)]
*  We mean it just the way you're hearing it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=74.52s)]
*  We are where we're coming for you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=76.24s)]
*  So brother, you and all the other people, the torturous, these are torturous conversations [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=79.46s)]
*  we're having. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=83.58s)]
*  Don't torture yourself. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=84.58s)]
*  Don't torture yourself. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=86.25999999999999s)]
*  Get your passport. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=87.74s)]
*  Get the hell out of the country, because hey, we're coming. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=88.74s)]
*  And guess what, bro, you ain't going to like it one bit. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=90.33999999999999s)]
*  Your crimes and your treason, Comey, all of you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=92.78s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=97.74s)]
*  Go go to the ends of the earth. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=98.74s)]
*  We will hunt you down and bring you back. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=100.0s)]
*  Drive the vermin out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=102.61999999999999s)]
*  Biden, you and your crime family are nothing but trash. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=107.74s)]
*  For Joe Biden and Dr. Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, all in the Biden, they're a bunch of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  feral dogs, right? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=119.3s)]
*  It's a family of feral dogs. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=120.82s)]
*  We're going to have to fumigate the lies of Joe Biden, the treason of Joe Biden and how [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  enfeebled he is. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=128.45999999999998s)]
*  After that, it's not the tapes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=130.34s)]
*  We're coming after Lisa Monaco, Merrick Garland, the senior members of DOJ that have prosecuted [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=131.66s)]
*  President Trump, Jack Smith. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  That's where you come in. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=141.66s)]
*  You're the vanguard of this revolution. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=142.94s)]
*  We're going to do what the Romans did to Carthage. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  We're going to salt the earth around it so there'll never be another building there again. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=146.94s)]
*  We're going to rebuild something else. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=151.38s)]
*  There'll be something that comes up and is rebuilt along the lines that's appropriate. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=152.7s)]
*  We've got to go back to the beginning. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=157.14s)]
*  We've got to go back to Russiagate. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=160.06s)]
*  We got to go back to who did that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=162.54s)]
*  We got to go back to Mola's commission. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=164.78s)]
*  We got to go back to Andrew Weisman and MSNBC and the New York Times and all of it, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=167.18s)]
*  Every FBI agent, all the CIA, DHS, Chris Ray, all of them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=172.84s)]
*  It's going to be a new day. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=178.54s)]
*  And MAGA will run things. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=180.66s)]
*  They're going to know that MAGA is not only ascendant, MAGA is in charge. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=182.4s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=188.06s)]
*  Victory or death. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=189.66s)]
*  So this isn't red meat for the base. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=195.98s)]
*  This isn't retribution, right? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=199.1s)]
*  This is retribution as much as Tony Soprano's dad was providing protection to the local butcher. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=201.3s)]
*  This is not a response to anything. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=208.1s)]
*  What this is is just menace and physical threat, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  It's not politics. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=215.54s)]
*  It's just power. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=216.54s)]
*  It's just force. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=217.54s)]
*  They're just promising violence. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=218.82s)]
*  That is what they're offering in this election, that this is how we should run the country now. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=221.1s)]
*  We will hunt you down and you'll know that we're in power and we're going to get rid [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  of law enforcement. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=231.18s)]
*  We're going to salt the earth and we're just going to hunt you down. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=232.18s)]
*  And this is not some random right-wing media guy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  This is the man who was the campaign manager for Donald Trump and also the senior White [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=239.34s)]
*  House advisor to the former president who is now their nominee again. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=244.62s)]
*  And it's not like he's the only one who's saying this thing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=249.14000000000001s)]
*  This is what they are offering the American public. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=251.94s)]
*  And they love it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=255.98000000000002s)]
*  They're super excited to be getting done with politics, getting right to the force and violence [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=256.98s)]
*  part of it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=262.06s)]
*  The next six months is going to be intense. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=263.06s)]
*  And we need to strap on our, let's see, what do we want to strap on? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=265.9s)]
*  We're going to strap on our seatbelt. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=272.21999999999997s)]
*  We're going to put on our helmet or your Kerry Lake ball cap. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=277.14s)]
*  We are going to put on the armor of God. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=281.38s)]
*  And maybe strap on a Glock on the side of a Fissing Case. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=289.14s)]
*  We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=294.62s)]
*  We will route the fake news media and we will liberate America from these villains once [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=298.86s)]
*  and for all. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=305.06s)]
*  Don't you think for a second he's not going to unleash hell on all of his political enemies? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=306.94s)]
*  This is where we are and now we have to finish it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=312.54s)]
*  You have to finish it once and for all. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=315.66s)]
*  They keep saying things like that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=319.42s)]
*  Once and for all. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=320.82s)]
*  Finish it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=321.82s)]
*  Vanquish them. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=322.82s)]
*  This is not politics. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=323.82s)]
*  In a political contest, you compete against your fellow citizens with whom you have political [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=325.06s)]
*  disagreements, the rival political party, whoever loses that fair race conceives, literally [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=329.82s)]
*  conceives, and then they come back. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=337.3s)]
*  They have the opportunity to come back in the next election cycle and compete against [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=339.18s)]
*  you again. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=342.94s)]
*  In real politics, nothing's ever finished. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=345.26s)]
*  You never take power once and for all. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=347.54s)]
*  Your enemies are not vanquished. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=349.62s)]
*  But they are not trying to win a political contest. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=353.34s)]
*  They are trying to do away with political contests in the United States of America, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=355.53999999999996s)]
*  which might be why they're not putting much energy into the normal way of competing in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  this year's political contest. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=363.85999999999996s)]
*  You may have seen this weekend, former president went to Detroit, which of course seems like [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  a normal thing for a political candidate to do, big city and a big swing state. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=369.85999999999996s)]
*  And he went to a black church trying to appeal to a demographic where he has room to grow. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=374.14s)]
*  But he goes to this black church in Detroit and his campaign does not take any steps to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=378.7s)]
*  avoid the pews being completely filled with white people, with white Trump supporters. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=382.9s)]
*  Then on the day, the message of his supposed campaign is that he's trying to appeal to [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=388.29999999999995s)]
*  black voters. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=392.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=393.46s)]
*  That's the whole point of doing this photo op. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=394.46s)]
*  He then goes straight from that venue stuffed with white people to a conference hosted by [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=396.38s)]
*  this guy who has been in the news for the last few months for saying, quote, We made [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=402.02s)]
*  a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s, saying that he thinks black [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=406.79999999999995s)]
*  people are not qualified to be airline pilots, that he worries if he's on a flight and sees [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=411.96s)]
*  that the pilot is black, who has been posting things like, quote, whiteness is great on [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  social media, who has been hosting guests on his podcast to talk about how black people [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=422.44s)]
*  are inherently biologically inferior and incapable of advanced intelligence. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=426.82s)]
*  Someone who said literally MLK, meaning Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=433.88s)]
*  quote, MLK was awful, not a good person. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=437.96000000000004s)]
*  So on the day your campaign message is, hey, black voters, look at me. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=443.44s)]
*  Aren't I appealing? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=447.68s)]
*  Going from the black church that's inexplicably full of white people right from there to go [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSpNYqgXCEc&t=448.92s)]
