# The Trump fraud case you forgot about: Scammy scheme lawsuit unnoticed among big cases
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI)
*  So the pitch sounded awesome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=0.0s)]
*  Listen to this, success at ACN is not a mystery. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  If you don't succeed, ACN doesn't succeed. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=5.98s)]
*  ACN uses a model with a proven track record [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=8.68s)]
*  and it's creating millionaires. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=11.88s)]
*  ACN, huh? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=15.88s)]
*  The ACN thing that was supposed to make you a millionaire [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=16.92s)]
*  is this fantastic gizmo. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=19.88s)]
*  It is a video phone, a miraculous space age invention [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=21.76s)]
*  that lets you see the person you are talking to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  on the phone. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=29.24s)]
*  The thing is though, in order to achieve the privilege [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  of selling this video phone gizmo, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=34.28s)]
*  you first had to pay the company $499. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=37.199999999999996s)]
*  Then after paying them your own 500 bucks, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=41.36s)]
*  specifically for the privilege [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=43.68s)]
*  of becoming a salesperson for them, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=45.08s)]
*  you then had to recruit other people [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  to sell these video phones [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=49.32s)]
*  or you had to sell a whole lot of them yourself. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=50.72s)]
*  And selling them turned out to be really hard [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=53.0s)]
*  because they were not really worth buying. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=55.36s)]
*  This magic ACN video phone gizmo could only be used [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=58.24s)]
*  to call other ACN video phones. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  So yeah, you could maybe sell one to your mom [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  if she loves you, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=68.52s)]
*  but she could not use it with anyone else [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=69.8s)]
*  unless you also sold one to your cousin or your aunt [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  and even then they could only talk to each other [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=74.44s)]
*  but no one else who didn't have one of these things. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=76.76s)]
*  You can see why this did not take off. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  Instead of making money selling ACN video phones, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=82.64s)]
*  most people who were recruited to sell these things [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  lost money. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  They pumped their savings into the hefty signup fee [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  and then they had to buy inventory to sell [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=92.28s)]
*  and then the company also charged them for training. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=95.2s)]
*  It all added up to a lot [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  and nobody wanted to buy these things. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  So some of the people who felt they were duped [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=101.92000000000002s)]
*  into this no win financial black hole of a business scam, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  they sued. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=109.2s)]
*  They sued over this promise of getting rich [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=110.08000000000001s)]
*  that they alleged was materially false. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=112.76s)]
*  But the people who sued did not sue the company [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  that made these phones. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=119.84s)]
*  They sued the guy who made the promise. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=121.84s)]
*  The guy who promised them that signing up [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  and scrimping together 500 bucks to be able to win [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=127.72s)]
*  the privilege of being allowed to sell these phones. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=131.32s)]
*  That was what would make them millionaires. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=133.84s)]
*  Access in ACN is not a mystery. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=138.36s)]
*  If you don't succeed, ACN doesn't succeed. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=140.6s)]
*  ACN uses a model with a proven track record [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=143.96s)]
*  and it's creating millionaires. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=146.92s)]
*  A proven track record creating millionaires. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump was the pitch man for ACN video phone gizmos [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=152.68s)]
*  appearing in promotional videos where he talked about [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=157.24s)]
*  how rich you would get by selling this thing. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=159.56s)]
*  He gave paid speeches at conferences all about this thing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=161.56s)]
*  and how you should sign up to sell it and you'd get rich. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=164.88s)]
*  He built an entire episode of his NBC show all around it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=167.32s)]
*  There are these ACN people standing with him [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=171.4s)]
*  and his adult children while he markets this thing on NBC. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=174.48s)]
*  The people who ultimately sued him [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=178.8s)]
*  say Trump's endorsement of this product, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=180.4s)]
*  again, for which he was being paid, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=182.32s)]
*  they say his endorsement was what got them to sign up [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=184.44s)]
*  and ultimately what lost them thousands of their own dollars. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=188.4s)]
*  The suit was first brought against Trump in 2018 [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=192.24s)]
*  when he was still president. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=194.28s)]
*  It's just now approaching trial and I mention this [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=195.24s)]
*  because if you, like thousands of households [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=198.84s)]
*  across the country, are making a list [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  of all these scheduled trials [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=203.56s)]
*  involving former president Donald Trump, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=205.68s)]
*  this is probably the one you keep forgetting. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=207.96s)]
*  I mean, there's the New York AG's fraud case [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  about Trump's business that's set for trial in October. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=212.0s)]
*  There's the federal civil defamation trial [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  brought by Eugene Carroll that's set for January next year. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=216.8s)]
*  There's the New York criminal trial [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  over campaign hush money payments, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=221.52s)]
*  the Stormy Daniels thing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=223.08s)]
*  That criminal trial scheduled for March. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=224.36s)]
*  There's the federal criminal trial on classified documents [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=226.72000000000003s)]
*  that's slated for May in Florida. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  There's also, of course, the federal January 6th trial [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=231.72000000000003s)]
*  which has yet to be scheduled [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=234.12s)]
*  but looks like it'll be fast. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=235.36s)]
*  But, and may we not overlook, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=238.12s)]
*  sandwiched between the defamation case [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  and the Manhattan criminal trial, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=242.68s)]
*  there really is the videophone trial. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=244.44000000000003s)]
*  The lawsuit alleging that Trump doothed people [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  into the videophone sales scam thing as a business scam. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=249.84s)]
*  So if you're making a chore wheel at home [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=255.88s)]
*  for deciding who's gonna be the point person in your family [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=257.6s)]
*  on each of Trump's upcoming scheduled trials, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=260.0s)]
*  if you land on videophone trial, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=262.76s)]
*  may this be your public service announcement [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=265.92s)]
*  that that is a real thing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5z3g_gjqHI&t=267.6s)]
