# 'Untrustworthy': Past colleagues of Trump's FBI pick, Kash Patel, warn he makes stuff up
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ)
*  On that same day, though, that we're going to get Tulsi Gabbard's confirmation hearing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=0.0s)]
*  on Thursday, we're going to have the confirmation hearing for Trump's choice to be FBI director. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=3.0s)]
*  Now, this is a job that should not be open, because FBI directors have 10-year terms. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=8.08s)]
*  FBI director Chris Wray has three years left in his 10-year term, but he inexplicably decided [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=13.96s)]
*  to resign before his term was up, which had purely and only the effect of making it easier [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  for Trump to install someone new in the job. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=28.4s)]
*  That was nice of him. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  But now, thanks to Chris Wray, here we are. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=32.28s)]
*  As January 6th pardon recipients start to get arrested for other crimes after Trump [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=37.3s)]
*  pardoned them, as one January 6th pardon recipient was killed in an altercation with police at [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=43.099999999999994s)]
*  a traffic stop yesterday in Indiana, as the Justice Department today starts to investigate [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=50.18s)]
*  its own prosecutors for having had the temerity to bring charges against January 6th rioters [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=56.88s)]
*  in the first place, let's just take this one day at a time. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=62.56s)]
*  Let's just take a second to reflect on who Trump is trying this week to install as head [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=69.0s)]
*  of the FBI, as head of the 38,000 Men and Women of the Nation's premier federal law [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=75.16s)]
*  enforcement agency, with all of its immense power and responsibility. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=80.36s)]
*  We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government, but in the media. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=86.56s)]
*  Yes, we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  We're going to come after you. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=97.84s)]
*  Whether it's criminal or civilly, we'll figure that out. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  But yeah, we're putting you all on notice. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=101.2s)]
*  That is Kash Patel, Donald Trump's pick to run the FBI, describing his plans for the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=104.18s)]
*  second Trump administration. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  That was in an interview in 2023. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=111.44s)]
*  You might have heard about that quote. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=114.0s)]
*  You might have heard that quote. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=116.04s)]
*  You might have also heard him describing his plans for the FBI's headquarters building [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  I shut down the FBI Hoover building on day one and reopening the next day as a museum [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=126.04s)]
*  of the deep state. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=132.52s)]
*  Well, hey, you know, at least he is pro-museum. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=133.52s)]
*  So those are two of the relatively recent statements by Kash Patel that I think have [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=138.28s)]
*  captured people's imagination, that have received a lot of traffic since Trump shockingly [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  named him as his choice to run the FBI. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  But there's been such a firehose of news and stuff to keep up with, with all of these [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  radical nominees. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=158.64s)]
*  This one week thus far of really radical action by the new president and his appointees, I [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=160.83999999999997s)]
*  mean, there's been so much that, you know, some of the truly wildly inappropriate or [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  unqualified or at least controversial nominees like Doug Burgum at the Interior Department [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=172.84s)]
*  or Kristi Noem at Homeland Security or even John Ratcliffe at the CIA. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=176.92s)]
*  I mean, they've just been sliding through without much attention, even though they deserve [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=180.92s)]
*  attention. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=185.32s)]
*  But you know, people only have so much bandwidth, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=188.32s)]
*  It's understandable. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=191.92s)]
*  It's regrettable. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=192.92s)]
*  It's lamentable. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=193.92s)]
*  But it's understandable. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=194.92s)]
*  That said, for the FBI specifically, given what Trump is already doing with law enforcement [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=196.96s)]
*  and the Justice Department and the pardons of all the people from January 6th, this is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  just one that I feel like we can't afford to let melt into the sauce, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=208.96s)]
*  Let's just look at a few other things about Kash Patel ahead of his confirmation hearings [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=215.12s)]
*  this week. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=219.84s)]
*  Here's one thing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=220.84s)]
*  This is not actually the first time Donald Trump has tried to install Kash Patel in a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=223.3s)]
*  high-ranking position in the FBI. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=227.22s)]
*  In the final months of Trump's first term, you might remember that Trump reportedly tried [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=230.74s)]
*  to make Kash Patel FBI Deputy Director. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=234.16000000000003s)]
*  That effort did not go well. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=237.9s)]
*  Trump's Attorney General at the time, Bill Barr, says he told the White House Kash Patel [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=239.38000000000002s)]
*  would be made FBI Deputy Director, quote, over my dead body. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=243.34s)]
*  Bill Barr wrote in his memoir, quote, Patel had virtually no experience that would qualify [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=249.26s)]
*  him to serve at the highest level of the world's preeminent law enforcement agency. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=253.56s)]
*  The very idea of moving Kash Patel into a role like this showed a shocking detachment [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=258.14s)]
*  from reality. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=264.26s)]
*  And that was when Trump wanted him as the number two guy in the FBI, let alone the director. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  But OK, you know, that's just one senior Trump administration official. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=273.86s)]
*  Bill Barr doesn't have that much credibility with any, any, any group of Americans at this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=277.18s)]
*  point in our political moment in America. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=286.66s)]
*  Set aside Bill Barr. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=290.3s)]
*  What about other Trump appointees who worked with Kash Patel? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=292.24s)]
*  Well, Trump's Deputy National Security Advisor, who worked closely with Kash Patel, he had [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=295.66s)]
*  this to say, quote, He's absolutely unqualified for FBI director. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=300.82s)]
*  He is untrustworthy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=305.74s)]
*  It is an absolute disgrace to American citizens to even consider an individual of this nature. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=307.6s)]
*  That's Trump's Deputy National Security Advisor. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=314.22s)]
*  And this, he's untrustworthy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=319.26s)]
*  This is kind of a theme and descriptions of Kash Patel from people specifically who worked [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=321.3s)]
*  with him in the first Trump term. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=325.62s)]
*  Several former Trump officials say that Kash Patel had a tendency to embellish, to mislead. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=328.98s)]
*  I think the word you're looking for here is lie about important stuff. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=334.26s)]
*  John Bolton, who you just saw on this evening with Jen Psaki here on MSNBC, he was Trump's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  National Security Advisor. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=343.9s)]
*  So therefore, effectively, Kash Patel's boss when he was at the National Security Council. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=345.82s)]
*  He described him tonight on MSNBC with Jen Psaki as a, quote, climbing weed. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=350.38s)]
*  He says Kash Patel falsely claimed to have been in charge of a whole directorate at the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=356.3s)]
*  National Security Council when he was not. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=361.14s)]
*  Bolton wrote in his book, quote, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  He worked on as a Justice Department lawyer. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=391.14s)]
*  Bolton, I said he said that in that book. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=394.18s)]
*  That was actually in an op-ed specifically opposing Kash Patel for this FBI job. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=397.3s)]
*  He exaggerated his role in cases he worked on as a Justice Department lawyer, as well [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=403.5s)]
*  as exaggerating his position in the National Security Council. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  What did he exaggerate about his time in the Justice Department? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=412.06s)]
*  What was that? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=416.46s)]
*  I was the main justice lead prosecutor for Benghazi. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=419.54s)]
*  For what? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=423.5s)]
*  No kidding. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=424.5s)]
*  Actually, yes, kidding, kidding. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=425.5s)]
*  Hopefully he was kidding because it's definitely not true. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=427.82s)]
*  New York Times, quote, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=430.98s)]
*  Mr. Patel has repeatedly claimed that he was the lead prosecutor in the government's pursuit [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=432.78000000000003s)]
*  of the perpetrators of the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=436.90000000000003s)]
*  which killed four Americans. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=442.02000000000004s)]
*  In reality, quote, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=443.3s)]
*  He had no role on the Benghazi trial team. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=445.3s)]
*  The pre-trial investigation was handled by a team led by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=447.98s)]
*  Office in Washington. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=451.94s)]
*  In his capacity as a junior prosecutor, Mr. Patel routed arrest warrants and the like [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=453.48s)]
*  up the chain for approval. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=459.74s)]
*  Quote, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=462.46000000000004s)]
*  And about six months before the first Benghazi case went to trial. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=474.3s)]
*  What was it that he said? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=478.42s)]
*  He said, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=479.7s)]
*  I was the main justice lead prosecutor for Benghazi. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=480.7s)]
*  Asked by Mother Jones Magazine about Cash Patel's claims to have led the Benghazi prosecution's [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=485.14s)]
*  efforts in D.C., a former FBI special agent who was on that investigation for years responded, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=490.14s)]
*  quote, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=496.26s)]
*  quote, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=497.26s)]
*  Oh my God, comma, no. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=498.26s)]
*  Oh my God, no. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=501.22s)]
*  Despite that, because sure, why not? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=505.3s)]
*  A Trump transition spokesman recently insisted that Cash Patel was, in fact, assigned as [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=507.3s)]
*  the lead Benghazi prosecutor. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=512.62s)]
*  Because that's their line and they're sticking to it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=516.02s)]
*  Here's another one. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=518.14s)]
*  A longtime Trump advisor tells the Atlantic magazine that, quote, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=519.14s)]
*  He had been in Patel's presence more than once when Patel claimed he was the person [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=523.3000000000001s)]
*  who, quote, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=527.94s)]
*  This despite the fact that the Baghdadi killing was, quote, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=528.94s)]
*  An operation for which Patel, by his own admission, wasn't even in the situation room. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=538.5s)]
*  Asked about this, Patel said through his spokesperson, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=544.5400000000001s)]
*  Trump made that brave and courageous call. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=547.46s)]
*  Yes, but what about the reports that you repeatedly claimed that you were the one who made the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=550.2600000000001s)]
*  call? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=556.5s)]
*  You, quote, gave the order. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=558.06s)]
*  What about that? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=561.82s)]
*  On the issue of January 6 specifically, as the Justice Department today is trying to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=565.46s)]
*  fire all the prosecutors involved in the federal January 6 case against Trump as they are opening [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=569.62s)]
*  an internal investigation into the prosecutors who brought cases against the rioters at the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=574.72s)]
*  Capitol. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=580.7s)]
*  Have you ever heard what Cash Patel says himself about January 6? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=581.7s)]
*  What about what that was? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, I should tell you that Cash Patel is credited officially as the producer [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  of the January 6 anthem, the rendition of the Star Spangled Banner, sung by a group [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  of imprisoned January 6 defendants overlaid with Donald Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  He's the producer of that hot track. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=608.16s)]
*  This is who Trump wants to be put in charge of the FBI. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  Cash Patel says it was the FBI that was behind January 6 in the first place. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=616.76s)]
*  What you need to show is whether or not the FBI and government agents were using undercover [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=625.0s)]
*  operatives and informants on the day of January 6. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  Once you prove that, then you defeat the insurrection narrative with the FBI's own documentation. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=632.92s)]
*  Forget what the videotape shows. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=638.4s)]
*  I started smirking and rolling my eyes. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=639.8s)]
*  And what I meant to convey with that is, come on, we know they were involved. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=642.42s)]
*  Well, no, no, no, no, look, I totally agree. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=645.76s)]
*  I'm not saying I know definitively. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=649.28s)]
*  It looks like you have a preponderance of evidence suggesting there may have been federal [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=651.16s)]
*  law enforcement involved in making that thing happen. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=655.84s)]
*  I'll get you beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=658.8s)]
*  Federal law enforcement involved in making that thing happen? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=662.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=664.52s)]
*  I'll get you beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=665.52s)]
*  Meaning, we'll criminally prosecute them for it, presumably, right? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  on a podcast, a podcast, by the way, that according to a recent Justice Department indictment, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=674.52s)]
*  was secretly funded by Russian state media as part of a Kremlin influence operation. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=679.48s)]
*  Neat. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=684.1999999999999s)]
*  The host of that podcast has said if those allegations are true, he was deceived about [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=685.28s)]
*  the funding. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=690.16s)]
*  But there he is with Cash Patel. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=691.68s)]
*  The host says, you know, hey, we know the FBI was involved in January 6. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=693.56s)]
*  Cash Patel says, I totally agree. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=697.3199999999999s)]
*  The FBI helped make January 6 happen. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=699.84s)]
*  I'll get you beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=702.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, he's Trump's choice to lead the FBI. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2zMlpSlnoQ&t=704.8399999999999s)]
