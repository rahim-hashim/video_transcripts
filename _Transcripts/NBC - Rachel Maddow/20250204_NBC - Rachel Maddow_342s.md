# FBI agents file lawsuits; turn 'weaponization' accusation back on Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds)
*  There are two new lawsuits against the Trump administration from FBI agents tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=0.0s)]
*  They both stem from this questionnaire, which the Trump administration ordered FBI agents [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=6.74s)]
*  to fill out by yesterday afternoon. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  The questionnaire asks about any involvement the agents might have had with January 6th [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=13.66s)]
*  investigations or the investigation into Trump hoarding classified documents at his Florida [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=18.64s)]
*  home. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=23.36s)]
*  The subject line on the email that sent out this questionnaire reportedly had the subject [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=24.62s)]
*  line, quote, termination, a not so implicit suggestion that all personnel who were involved [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=28.78s)]
*  in any of these cases might face termination because of it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=36.260000000000005s)]
*  Even though there had been a little bit of noise that the Trump appointed acting officials [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=41.38s)]
*  at the top of the FBI were somehow going to resist the this demand to hand over all this [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=44.660000000000004s)]
*  information, there was reporting that they were not happy with being asked to do this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=50.82s)]
*  Today we learned that the acting officials at the top of the FBI, they did hand over [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=56.7s)]
*  details on thousands of FBI employees who worked on these cases. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=61.46s)]
*  So one of the two lawsuits that's now been filed is from nine FBI agents. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=67.78s)]
*  It argues that the specific purpose of that survey, quote, is to identify agents and other [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=71.74s)]
*  FBI personnel to be terminated as a form of politically motivated retribution. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=77.02s)]
*  That lawsuit asks a federal judge to stop the Trump administration from compiling effectively [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=82.36s)]
*  a target list, a go get them list of FBI agents, which they fear might be made public by the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=87.32s)]
*  White House. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=93.12s)]
*  They point to a social media post from the leader of the pro-Trump paramilitary group, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=94.12s)]
*  the Proud Boys, who was recently pardoned by Trump and released from prison. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=98.16s)]
*  He's now online urging retaliation against individual FBI agents by name. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=102.44s)]
*  The second lawsuit is brought by seven FBI agents and the FBI Agents Association. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=110.12s)]
*  It also asks the court for protection from the Trump administration's, quote, anticipated [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=114.76s)]
*  retaliatory decision to expose their personal information for opprobrium and potential vigilante [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=120.64s)]
*  action by those who they were investigating. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=127.0s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the lawyers behind that second lawsuit, Bradley Moss. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=131.08s)]
*  Mr. Moss, I really appreciate you taking time to be here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=134.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  Good evening, Rachel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  What kind of relief are you looking for with this lawsuit? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=139.56s)]
*  What do you want the court to do? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=142.16s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=143.72s)]
*  So at its core, this is a pretty simple, straightforward lawsuit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=144.72s)]
*  It's seeking to maintain the privacy and the anonymity of these rank and file FBI officials. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=148.04s)]
*  These are a number of individuals ranking from simple tech specialists, forensics examiners, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=155.48s)]
*  even special agents who did their job. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=162.0s)]
*  conducting an investigation into possible criminal actions by the former president. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=165.84s)]
*  They did their investigation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=170.6s)]
*  They turned the information over to the DOJ, which chose to then bring prosecutions. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=172.52s)]
*  Now they're being potentially retaliated against. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=177.44s)]
*  Their names are going to be publicly exposed in a way that's not standard for FBI practice [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=180.36s)]
*  and runs a file not only of arguably constitutional provisions, but also the Privacy Act, which [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  is federal law, and expose that to the public for one purpose and one purpose only, which [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=191.76s)]
*  is to let the Proud Boys, which is to let all these guys and gals who got prosecuted [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=197.04s)]
*  over the January 6 riots, let them know who these officials were and potentially put them [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  in danger. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=207.39999999999998s)]
*  That cannot stand. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=208.48s)]
*  That's what this lawsuit is seeking to prevent. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=209.92s)]
*  We learned today that the FBI did hand over to the Trump administration, to Trump's Justice [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  Department, this list of thousands of employees who were involved in these cases, as you [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=219.36s)]
*  say, not just special agents, but also FBI personnel and analysts at all different levels [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=224.08s)]
*  of the Bureau. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=228.52s)]
*  We learned that the names, well, the information about employees was handed over. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=230.96s)]
*  Specifically, their names were not directly included, although their employee numbers [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=235.88000000000002s)]
*  were handed over, which could be matched in government databases to produce their names. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=240.98000000000002s)]
*  I wanted to ask whether that was a disappointing turn of events. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=246.48s)]
*  Did your clients hope the FBI leadership would somehow stand up more strongly against these [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  requests and actually refuse to hand over this data? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=256.24s)]
*  Well, certainly we didn't want them handing over anything, though. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  What I will say for what FBI leadership did was they basically slow-walked this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=262.2s)]
*  They're making the Justice Department, they're making the White House do the work to actually [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=267.48s)]
*  match this up, to take these identifiers and match them to names. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=272.2s)]
*  That's going to take time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=276.64s)]
*  And it's a question, obviously, of how much time and effort both the Justice Department [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=277.64s)]
*  and the White House want to put into finding and matching up all these individuals. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=281.32s)]
*  Look, if the existing leadership at FBI had simply outright refused, had declined to provide [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  anything, it's arguable they would have been purged, and they would have kept purging people [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=291.52s)]
*  until they found someone, until they found their version of Bork from the 70s to eventually [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=295.24s)]
*  just turn over the information. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=300.8s)]
*  So what's happened is happened. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  It's right now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=304.5s)]
*  This is still not public information, and we're seeking to make sure it does not become [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=305.5s)]
*  public information. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  Attorney Bradley Moss, representing FBI agents in this suit, thank you very much for helping [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=311.48s)]
*  us understand it, Mr. Moss. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=315.8s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=316.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=317.8s)]
*  Have a good night. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=318.8s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=319.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYV_U9SQwds&t=330.72s)]
