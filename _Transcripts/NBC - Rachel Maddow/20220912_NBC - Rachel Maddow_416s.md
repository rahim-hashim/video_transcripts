# How Trump Loyalists In The DOJ Pushed Prosecutors To Protect 'Individual-1'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono)
*  Here's more that we the American people now know, thanks to this new book from Jeffrey [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=0.0s)]
*  Berman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=5.04s)]
*  Quote, while Michael Cohen pled guilty, our office continued to pursue investigations [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=6.04s)]
*  related to other possible campaign finance violations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=11.08s)]
*  When Bill Barr took over as U.S. Attorney General in February 2019, six months after [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=14.52s)]
*  Cohen's guilty plea, he not only tried to kill the ongoing investigations we were engaged [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=18.84s)]
*  But incredibly, he suggested that Cohen's conviction on campaign finance charges should [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=26.88s)]
*  be reversed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=31.16s)]
*  Barr summoned my deputy Rob Kusami, who was overseeing the Cohen case, in late February [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=32.76s)]
*  to challenge the basis of Cohen's plea as well as the reasoning behind pursuing similar [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=37.72s)]
*  campaign finance charges against other individuals. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=42.8s)]
*  Kusami was told to cease all investigative work on the campaign finance allegations until [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=45.68s)]
*  until Maine Justice determined there was a legal basis for the campaign finance charges [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=51.66s)]
*  to which Cohen pled guilty and until Barr determined there was a sufficient federal [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=56.059999999999995s)]
*  interest in pursuing charges against others. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  The directive Bill Barr gave my deputy Rob Kusami, which was amplified that same day [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=65.06s)]
*  by a follow-up call from Edward O'Callaghan, that directive was explicit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=70.14s)]
*  Not a single investigative step could be taken, not a single document in our possession could [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=74.78s)]
*  be reviewed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=79.22s)]
*  If Maine Justice decided in the end that there was no legal basis for the charges, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=81.38s)]
*  well, the Attorney General of the United States would then direct us to dismiss the campaign [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=86.14s)]
*  finance guilty pleas of Michael Cohen, the man who implicated the Attorney General's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=90.78s)]
*  boss, the President. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=95.94s)]
*  Barr's posture here raises obvious questions, Berman writes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=98.78s)]
*  Did he think dropping the campaign finance charges would bolster Trump's defense against [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=102.94s)]
*  impeachment charges? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=107.06s)]
*  Was he trying to ensure that no other Trump associates or employees would be charged with [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=108.46s)]
*  making hush money payments or perhaps flip on the president? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=112.53999999999999s)]
*  Was the goal to ensure that the president could not be charged after leaving office? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=116.1s)]
*  Was it part of an effort to undo the entire series of investigations and prosecutions [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=120.74s)]
*  over the past two years of those in the president's orbit? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=124.85999999999999s)]
*  Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=128.26s)]
*  At SDNY, Jeff Berman says he was told by Trump appointees to bring a prosecution against [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=134.7s)]
*  President Obama's White House counsel, despite the fact that that man had committed no crime. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=141.06s)]
*  Trump's attorney general also told Berman's office to stop investigating anybody else [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=146.89999999999998s)]
*  who was involved in the campaign finance felonies that put the president's lawyer in prison, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=151.39999999999998s)]
*  campaign finance felonies that directly involved the president himself and were committed for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=157.1s)]
*  his benefit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=161.42s)]
*  They also tried to undo Michael Cohen's guilty plea. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=163.44s)]
*  They did not succeed in that, but they did delay by months any further investigation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=166.3s)]
*  into other people involved in Cohen's crimes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=170.84s)]
*  And that's not it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=175.2s)]
*  Look at this from Berman's new book. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=176.48s)]
*  Trump's Justice Department tells SDNY not only that they want to evaluate the basis [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=178.88s)]
*  of Cohen's plea and they want SDNY to stop investigating anybody else who might have [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=184.14s)]
*  been involved in those crimes committed by the Trump campaign to try to cover up evidence [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=189.34s)]
*  of alleged affairs. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=194.58s)]
*  SDNY also contacted, was also contacted by Trump's Justice Department senior officials [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=196.78s)]
*  and they were told that they needed to get rid of all mentions of individual one in the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=204.46s)]
*  Michael Cohen indictment. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=209.9s)]
*  SDNY said no to that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  But SDNY officials did take out of the Michael Cohen related court filings the most direct [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  language they'd had in those filings saying what role Trump played in those crimes. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=221.86s)]
*  Here's how Berman describes it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  Main justice interfered when the information was being finalized. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=230.3s)]
*  After Michael Cohen agreed to plead guilty, the charging instrument for him became an [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=234.5s)]
*  information rather than an indictment. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=238.34s)]
*  And Berman says, quote, it was about 40 pages long and it referenced a person identified [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=242.22s)]
*  as individual one as having acted in concert with Cohen. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=246.84s)]
*  There was zero doubt as to the identity of individual one. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=250.06s)]
*  It was Donald J. Trump. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  After SDNY sent the indictment, the information to main justice, quote, the next day Robert [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=254.24s)]
*  Kusami, my deputy who was overseeing the case, received a call from Edward O'Callaghan. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=259.5s)]
*  O'Callaghan was aggressive. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=264.46s)]
*  Why the length? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=266.26s)]
*  He wanted to know. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=267.26s)]
*  He argued that now that Cohen was pleading guilty, we don't need all this description. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=268.5s)]
*  Kusami responded, what exactly are you concerned about? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=273.18s)]
*  O'Callaghan proceeded to identify specific allegations he wanted removed, almost all [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=276.14s)]
*  of which referenced individual one, Donald Trump. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=280.34s)]
*  It quickly became apparent to Kusami that contrary to what O'Callaghan professed, it [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=284.18s)]
*  wasn't the overall length or the detail of the document that concerned him. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=288.78s)]
*  It was any mention of individual one. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=292.54s)]
*  Kusami and O'Callaghan went through a handful of these allegations, some of which Kusami [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=295.7s)]
*  agreed to strike, others he did not. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=299.34s)]
*  Sensing that this was going to be a long and adversarial process, Kusami told O'Callaghan [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  that he was now aware of O'Callaghan's concerns and the team would redraft the information [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=306.18s)]
*  and remove certain non-essential details. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=310.58s)]
*  The team was tasked with the rewrite. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=313.14s)]
*  They stayed up most of the night. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  The revised information in Cohen's case was now 21 pages down from 40. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=316.06s)]
*  It removed certain allegations, including allegations that individual one acted in concert [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=323.56s)]
*  with and coordinated with Cohen on the illegal campaign contributions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=329.76s)]
*  The information now alleged that Cohen acted in concert and coordinated with, quote, one [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=336.64s)]
*  or more members of the campaign. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=342.04s)]
*  So individual one, Donald Trump, he did this stuff with Donald Trump becomes, he did this [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=345.68s)]
*  stuff with someone from the campaign. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=352.16s)]
*  The specific mentions of Cohen committing this crime, this federal felony in concert [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=356.24s)]
*  with and coordinating with Trump in the commission of the crime, those specific references were [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=362.82000000000005s)]
*  taken out of this court filing to not mention Trump specifically. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=367.6s)]
*  And the investigators in that case were also directed by main justice that they needed [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=374.8s)]
*  to stop investigating anybody other than Michael Cohen for these crimes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=378.76s)]
*  And that delay lasted for months. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=384.08s)]
*  So now we know, right? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=387.58s)]
*  I mean, Michael Cohen kept saying in public, why am I the only person getting in trouble [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=388.58s)]
*  for this? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=392.08s)]
*  It's not like I did it for myself. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=393.08s)]
*  It's not like I did it alone. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9MMeIVono&t=394.08s)]
