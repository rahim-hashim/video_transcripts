# Rep. Raskin Breaks Down What Contempt Charges Mean For Scavino, Navarro
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM)
*  The hearing that you had today was about contempt recommendations for Dan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=0.0s)]
*  Scavino and Peter Navarro. The Justice Department has not acted on the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=4.64s)]
*  contempt recommendations that you sent for Mark Meadows last year. So can you [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=9.68s)]
*  explain to me how this works? Your committee recommends criminal contempt [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=14.08s)]
*  action. It has to go to the Justice Department and they are the deciders on that front. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=19.76s)]
*  Well, ultimately it will go to a grand jury and a grand jury would have to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=23.92s)]
*  issue the indictment. But the Department of Justice will obviously have the key influence [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=30.480000000000004s)]
*  over what a grand jury sees and the arguments that are being made. So they are the decisive [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  influence. It's very important for us not to let people just blow off the Congress of the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  United States. The Supreme Court has been clear that citizens who receive a subpoena [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=49.2s)]
*  from a court or from Congress must comply with it and that applies to every citizen. The idea [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=56.0s)]
*  that they're asserting executive privilege is ridiculous because one, the President of [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=63.2s)]
*  the United States, Joe Biden, has said he's not asserting executive privilege. Two, Scavino [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=67.92s)]
*  is saying, well, you know, they've got executive privilege through Donald Trump. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=75.84s)]
*  Donald Trump is not asserting executive privilege for these guys. He's nowhere to be found. And in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=80.72000000000001s)]
*  any event, even if Joe Biden were to assert it for them, it wouldn't work because executive [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  privilege relates to people who have something substantive to advise a president about, like, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  like, you know, the trade adviser can talk about trade, but the trade adviser wouldn't have any [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=103.44s)]
*  kind of executive privilege to have asserted for him by the president related to an insurrection or [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=110.48s)]
*  other criminal activity. So executive privilege doesn't apply to crime and insurrection. The [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=115.84s)]
*  courts have roundly rejected it. And, you know, we have very little patience for these arguments [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  anymore. The courts are slapping it down and we're not accepting it. And we fully expect that these [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=128.4s)]
*  guys are going to have to comply very quickly if they want to avoid criminal contempt. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCsnHRprfAM&t=136.08s)]
