# Maddow on Democratic ticket switch: 'The old era is over, and the new era is here.'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA)
*  What a day in history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=0.0s)]
*  President Joe Biden making American history [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=1.96s)]
*  with an act of profound political and personal sacrifice. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=5.28s)]
*  Three and a half years into his presidency, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=10.88s)]
*  President Joe Biden stepping down from his reelection bid [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=13.72s)]
*  in favor of his vice president, Kamala Harris. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=17.04s)]
*  I've been processing this for five hours already [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=21.96s)]
*  and it still gives me chills to say it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=25.42s)]
*  In the instant he announced it at 1.46 PM this afternoon, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=28.54s)]
*  everything changed, everything changed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=32.54s)]
*  The Democratic Party instantly ends its internal war, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=35.46s)]
*  this emotional, intense, harrowing fight [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=39.9s)]
*  that has torn the party apart [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=43.22s)]
*  for the past three and a half weeks, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=44.82s)]
*  that is over in an instant. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  The expectation among Democrats, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=49.18s)]
*  which was being voiced more and more openly in recent days, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=50.84s)]
*  the expectation that the Democratic Party [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=53.46s)]
*  was in for a historic wipeout in November [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=55.3s)]
*  with not just the White House in danger, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=59.22s)]
*  but the House and the Senate in danger as well, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=60.78s)]
*  that expectation evaporates also in an instant. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  With President Biden voicing a strong [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=68.42s)]
*  and unequivocal endorsement of his vice president, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=71.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris, with Vice President Harris [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=74.16s)]
*  confirming immediately that she is running, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=76.14s)]
*  saying we have 107 days until election day, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=79.38s)]
*  together we will fight and together we will win [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=82.14s)]
*  with no resulting ambiguity [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=84.7s)]
*  about who will be the Democratic Party's nominee [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=87.22s)]
*  and what is the task at hand [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=89.58s)]
*  for that nominee and for the party. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=91.58s)]
*  The little scratchy papery sound [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=95.12s)]
*  you're hearing in the distance, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=97.5s)]
*  that's every Democratic donor in the country [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=99.46s)]
*  writing the biggest check they have ever written [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  in American politics. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=104.86s)]
*  In an instant, the old era is over [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=107.02s)]
*  and the new era is here, it is go time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=111.02s)]
*  Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in 2020 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  in an election in which Trump refused to accept the result [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=118.06s)]
*  and tried to stay in power by the use of violent force. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=122.02s)]
*  Trump has since been convicted of 34 felonies [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=125.3s)]
*  and is awaiting sentencing on those charges [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=127.78s)]
*  he's facing up to four years in prison. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=129.78s)]
*  He has been found liable for committing sexual assault, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=131.74s)]
*  he owes literally hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=134.34s)]
*  in civil penalties for massive fraud at his business. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=137.44s)]
*  His business has been found criminally guilty [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=141.06s)]
*  of business fraud and he owes hundreds of millions [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=144.14s)]
*  of dollars in a civil fraud case. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=148.26s)]
*  He is the subject of a felony RICO indictment [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=150.98s)]
*  in the state of Georgia, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  he is also facing federal criminal charges. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=154.42s)]
*  He is now 78 years old and gives speeches [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=156.82s)]
*  of such rambling incoherence [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=159.45999999999998s)]
*  that even his most ardent super vans [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=161.32s)]
*  start wandering off or checking their phones [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=165.29999999999998s)]
*  by the time he starts talking about sharks and shower heads [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=167.73999999999998s)]
*  and how beautiful you would think he looks [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=170.82s)]
*  if he were to take his clothes off. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=172.9s)]
*  He just picked a 39 year old running mate [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=175.74s)]
*  who most Americans do not know [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=178.46s)]
*  and who has basically no record in public service. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=180.3s)]
*  As people are Googling Donald Trump's new unknown [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=183.8s)]
*  running mate, the first thing most of them are learning [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=187.38000000000002s)]
*  about him is that he is deeply committed [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  to a nationwide ban on abortion, nationwide. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  He is the protege of an eccentric right wing tech billionaire [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=194.5s)]
*  who is against women having the right to vote [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=198.78000000000003s)]
*  and who says he's against democracy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=201.14s)]
*  The right wing groups that have championed this guy [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=204.18s)]
*  for Trump's running mate are the authors [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=206.44s)]
*  of the project 2025 policy blueprint [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=208.78s)]
*  you have heard so much about. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=211.6s)]
*  The policy blueprint for what the Republicans plan to do [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=213.2s)]
*  if they do succeed in getting Trump and now Vance [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=216.28s)]
*  back into the White House. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=219.74s)]
*  A national abortion ban is just the start, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=221.44s)]
*  try cracking down on birth control and fertility treatment, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  try banning pornography, try defunding the FBI [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=227.92s)]
*  and the Department of Homeland Security, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=232.32s)]
*  say goodbye to the Department of Education [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=234.24s)]
*  and the Environmental Protection Agency and the FDA. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=236.92s)]
*  Really, the Food and Drug Administration [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=241.12s)]
*  because who among us doesn't wanna think we're buying aspirin [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=245.0s)]
*  but it turns out to be rat poison. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=247.4s)]
*  Republicans and Trump himself [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  had been uncharacteristically disciplined [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=251.84s)]
*  when it came to commenting on this very difficult [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=254.92s)]
*  knockdown drag out fight within the Democratic Party [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=258.44s)]
*  over these last few weeks. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=261.76s)]
*  The concerns about President Biden showing his age. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=262.86s)]
*  Republicans were being very reticent, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=265.76s)]
*  very disciplined about not talking about that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=267.88s)]
*  because they were crossing their fingers [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  and hoping that President Biden would stay in. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=272.06s)]
*  Expecting that President Biden was going to stay in, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  they were measuring the drapes, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=279.32s)]
*  looking at the polls and bragging about their sure, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=281.18s)]
*  absolutely guaranteed victory. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=284.94s)]
*  What Trump's pollster last week said was [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=287.26s)]
*  between 20 and 25 different paths to victory [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=290.22s)]
*  in the electoral map. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=294.0s)]
*  He said, after we got to about 25 different paths to victory, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=295.22s)]
*  we stopped counting. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  They have been so sure. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=300.36s)]
*  President Biden, perhaps cannily, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=304.3s)]
*  waiting until the supremely self-confident Republican side [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  locked in their ticket. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=311.6s)]
*  Waiting until Trump picked the most radical, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=314.16s)]
*  the most ideologically extreme [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=317.04s)]
*  and even eccentric choice for his running mate. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=318.88s)]
*  Waited until that was locked in and then today, 1.46 PM, boom. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=321.76s)]
*  Today, Donald Trump's remarkable recent run [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  of political good luck came to an end with a crash. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=330.18s)]
*  The old man in the race now is Donald Trump, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=335.26s)]
*  78 years old and only occasionally coherent, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=337.74s)]
*  with a record as president that is viewed by historians [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=341.22s)]
*  as the worst in the history of the country, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=343.62s)]
*  a tenure that ended in violence. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=345.78000000000003s)]
*  And he refuses to promise that there won't be more violence [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=348.62s)]
*  to come from his supporters. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=351.38s)]
*  He is the old man in the race by a mile. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=352.90000000000003s)]
*  Dragging that legacy from what happened [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=357.3s)]
*  the last time he was in office [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=359.62s)]
*  and now a national abortion ban [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=361.3s)]
*  and maybe his own prison sentence with him to the polls. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=363.54s)]
*  And as of today, we know that his opponent [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  will not be a man older than him. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=370.02000000000004s)]
*  As of today, we know his opponent will be a 59-year-old [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=371.98s)]
*  former prosecutor, attorney general, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=374.70000000000005s)]
*  US Senator and vice president to Joe Biden, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  who cemented his legacy today with a decision [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=380.38s)]
*  that will go down in history as one of the most selfless, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  patriotic sacrifices of any sitting president ever. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=387.22s)]
*  1.46 p.m., Joe Biden changed everything today in an instant. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN5JMDycJQA&t=391.48s)]
