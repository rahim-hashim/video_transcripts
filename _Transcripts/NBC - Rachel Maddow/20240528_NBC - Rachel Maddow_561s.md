Video Description: An important argument in Donald Trump's criminal defense in his New York trial is that a phone call made by Michael Cohen was too brief, roughly a minute and a half, to have included what Cohen said it did. The prosecution showed in real time that not only could it be cone in a minute and a half, it could be done in 49 seconds. Rachel Maddow's read of that portion of the transcript also comes in at under a minute.

# Rachel Maddow reenacts key debunking of Trump defense argument
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU)
*  One dramatic moment in today's closing arguments, today's summations from the defense and then the prosecution, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=0.0s)]
*  happened fairly early on in the prosecution summation. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=8.0s)]
*  The prosecutor acted out for the jury a phone call between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump, a phone call as it could have happened. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=12.0s)]
*  This is an important phone call because the defense had sort of hung a big part of its case on the idea that Cohen, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=22.0s)]
*  Michael Cohen, was lying about a phone call that he said he had with Donald Trump about Stormy Daniels because that phone call was very short. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=29.0s)]
*  That phone call was only, I believe, a minute and 36 seconds long. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=38.0s)]
*  Cohen also in that time says he spoke to Trump's bodyguard. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=42.0s)]
*  He had to speak to Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and say, hey, will you put Trump on? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=46.0s)]
*  And then he spoke with Trump about Stormy Daniels. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=50.0s)]
*  The defense claimed that if it was only a minute and 36 seconds, that just wasn't enough time for Cohen to have had any substantive discussion with Trump about Stormy Daniels and about this alleged hush money plot. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=54.0s)]
*  They said the length of that call, which they had from phone records, effectively disproved that that conversation between Cohen and Trump could have gone the way Cohen said. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=66.0s)]
*  So this is from today's court transcript. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=77.0s)]
*  This is the prosecutor, Joshua Stein glass, acting sort of sort of recreating that call and timing himself doing it so the jury could experience in real time how long it might reasonably have taken for Cohen and Trump to have the conversation that Michael Cohen says they had. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=80.0s)]
*  Joshua Stein glass, the prosecutor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=102.0s)]
*  And that brings us to the phone call on October 24th at 8 0 2 p.m. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=104.0s)]
*  In which Cohen testified that he called to speak with Mr. Trump. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=107.0s)]
*  And it turns out that at first he was speaking to Keith Schiller about getting harassing phone calls. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=111.0s)]
*  And of course, the defense says, aha, that's perjury. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=116.0s)]
*  The only interpretation of that is that he's lying. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=118.0s)]
*  That's the only interpretation that they want you to consider to them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=121.0s)]
*  That is the big lie. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=124.0s)]
*  But that's not the only interpretation. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=125.0s)]
*  Stein glass says, forgive me for a minute, but let's try a little experiment. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=128.0s)]
*  I will be Cohen. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=132.0s)]
*  Hey, Keith, how's it going? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=134.0s)]
*  It seems like this prankster might be a 14 year old kid. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=136.0s)]
*  If I text you the number, can you call and talk to his family? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=138.0s)]
*  See if you can let them know how serious this is. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=141.0s)]
*  It's not a joke. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=143.0s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=144.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=145.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=146.0s)]
*  Thanks, pal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=147.0s)]
*  Hey, is the boss near you? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=148.0s)]
*  Can you pass him the phone for a minute? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=149.0s)]
*  I'll wait just a couple of seconds. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=150.0s)]
*  Hey, boss. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=154.0s)]
*  I know you're busy, but I just wanted to let you know that this other thing is moving forward [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=155.0s)]
*  with my friend Keith Davidson and the other party that we discussed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=158.0s)]
*  It's back on track. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=162.0s)]
*  I'm going to try one last time to get our friend David, our friend David Pecker to pay. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=163.0s)]
*  But if it's not, it's going to be on us to take care of it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=169.0s)]
*  Uh huh. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=173.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=174.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=175.0s)]
*  Good luck in Tampa. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=176.0s)]
*  Bye. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=177.0s)]
*  And then just Stein glass says 49 seconds. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=178.0s)]
*  So Katie was just describing this having been there in court with this type of a moment [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=182.0s)]
*  when the defense has said, ah, a minute and 36 seconds. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=187.0s)]
*  That's so fast. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=191.0s)]
*  You can't get anything done in that time. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=192.0s)]
*  And then you walk through the jury through something that takes significantly less than [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=193.0s)]
*  that time and say, that didn't seem like it was me screaming through it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=197.0s)]
*  That seems viable, doesn't it? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=201.0s)]
*  It's so impactful because it leans into the common sense that the judge is actually going [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=204.0s)]
*  to read as a part of a jury instruction tomorrow to them that they can rely on their common [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=208.0s)]
*  sense to be able to make decisions in this case during the course of the deliberations. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=213.0s)]
*  And so when you have the process, you get up in a very relatable way, have this reenactment. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=216.0s)]
*  I'll put it in quotes because it definitely wasn't based on a transcript, but it sounded [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=222.0s)]
*  totally credible the way that you just read it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=226.0s)]
*  And it took only 49 seconds. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=228.0s)]
*  That's the real life application of what makes it grounded in their sense of common sense. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=230.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=236.0s)]
*  And when you have a myriad examples during the course of the closing arguments, Lawrence [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=237.0s)]
*  talked about it as well. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=242.0s)]
*  How can you say that he didn't get reimbursed, but then you say that he stole it because [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=243.0s)]
*  it was legal services rendered. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=247.0s)]
*  So he really got legal fees. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=249.0s)]
*  You can't steal your legal fees. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=250.0s)]
*  Can you? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=251.0s)]
*  I mean, it's things like that that you're like as a jury, like, oh yeah, you can't do that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=252.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=256.0s)]
*  So I mean, for me, if you're the jury, the defense has offered to Chris's point, has [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=257.0s)]
*  offered a few alternate explanations for the fact pattern that's been presented. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=263.0s)]
*  One of the most compelling, surprising, memorable moments was when the defense said, hey, you [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=268.0s)]
*  know, that call that Michael Cohen described where he said he had to get Keith Schiller [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=275.0s)]
*  to get Trump on the phone. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=279.0s)]
*  Let me tell you what else is in Michael Cohen's phone records around there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=281.0s)]
*  Let me tell you about this 14 year old child that was harassing Michael Cohen. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=284.0s)]
*  You didn't know about that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=289.0s)]
*  This is a rabbit I'm pulling out of the hat. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=290.0s)]
*  This is a whole new interpretation of this fact pattern. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=292.0s)]
*  And the reason this is important is not only because it's memorable and it's going to stick [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=295.0s)]
*  in your mind is something the prosecution didn't tell you, but it also disproves that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=299.0s)]
*  that call with Trump ever could have happened. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=303.0s)]
*  And so even if that was that was the one most compelling, most memorable thing that the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=306.0s)]
*  defense produced, Joshua Stein glass today essentially said, wipe that off the balance [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=310.0s)]
*  sheet in terms of whether or not you think you've got a contrary explanation of the facts [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=315.0s)]
*  that punctures the believability of the prosecution's case. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=321.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and that I always thought the sort of refutation of that seemed a bit excessive [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=324.0s)]
*  in the in the actual in the cross that they did like hanging on that phone call, partly [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=330.0s)]
*  because, again, the totality of the evidence seems so, you know, that you're one phone [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=335.0s)]
*  call from Cohen to Trump isn't the most important thing. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=340.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. You take it away. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=342.0s)]
*  Maybe there's a credibility issue. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=343.0s)]
*  We still got a lot of other stuff you got to deal with. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=344.0s)]
*  But to the point that Ari was just making that again, it's all about just giving people [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=346.0s)]
*  enough like there's just like, is there someone there you're giving enough to just be like, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=352.0s)]
*  no, I don't know. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=357.0s)]
*  Like, what about X? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=358.0s)]
*  What about Y? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=359.0s)]
*  What about Z as ammunition for a hung jury? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=360.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=362.0s)]
*  And you just I'm not going to say what you said to me during the commercial break because [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=363.0s)]
*  I thought it was a really smart point. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=367.0s)]
*  You should actually make it on air. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=368.0s)]
*  But like, how's that? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=369.0s)]
*  How's that? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=371.0s)]
*  I was tempted to seal it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=372.0s)]
*  But the point that you made about a strategy for an acquittal versus strategy for a hung [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=375.0s)]
*  jury, just talk about that because I think it actually helps me make sense to Rachel, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=380.0s)]
*  your point of what they're trying to do, because what I find is there's no alternate theory [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=383.0s)]
*  here for what happens. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=387.0s)]
*  So then what? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=388.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that's why this sometimes sounds like a lot of silly and meandering [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=389.0s)]
*  arguments. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=394.0s)]
*  Many people have observed that the Trump approach from his lawyers during the case and in today's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=395.0s)]
*  closing were meandering. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=399.0s)]
*  I think they're meandering because it's only a strategy to get a hung jury, which means [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=400.0s)]
*  one or two holdouts is good enough. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=404.0s)]
*  You don't get a verdict that's hung jury and they probably don't retry the case. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=406.0s)]
*  So that plays as Trump skates. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=410.0s)]
*  And that's different than an acquittal strategy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=412.0s)]
*  If you remember OJ, you say there's really bad evidence. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=414.0s)]
*  There's even DNA evidence. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=416.0s)]
*  The acquittal strategy is a completely alternative theory. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=417.0s)]
*  Some might call it a conspiracy theory, but it's one that touches all the evidence. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=420.0s)]
*  You say, yeah, no, there is bad DNA evidence of blood because they planted his blood on [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=424.0s)]
*  the scene and you have this full theory. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=428.0s)]
*  There's nothing like that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=430.0s)]
*  There's way too many open questions. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=431.0s)]
*  There's way too many obvious things that they have not even tried the defense lawyers to [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=433.0s)]
*  Trump to explain. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=437.0s)]
*  They literally have it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=438.0s)]
*  All they're doing is the strategy of questions, reasonable doubt, hung jury, get one or two [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=439.0s)]
*  people. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=446.0s)]
*  And so earlier we were talking as well about it's pretty bonkers bananas, not believable [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=447.0s)]
*  to say that the Access Hollywood tape was not a problem for the campaign. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=452.0s)]
*  We checked. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=455.0s)]
*  I mean, many of us have done our homework. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=456.0s)]
*  It's the only time we could find a public apology ever uttered by Donald Trump. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=457.0s)]
*  Literally the only time he said not, I'm sorry. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=463.0s)]
*  You feel bad. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=466.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=467.0s)]
*  You're terrible. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=468.0s)]
*  No, he actually said, if you go back at the tape, I said these things. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=469.0s)]
*  I was wrong. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=471.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=472.0s)]
*  It's also the only time the jury heard him speak in the trial. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=473.0s)]
*  So he doesn't testify. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=477.0s)]
*  But one of the only times they saw him on camera speaking is in the C-SPAN entry into [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=478.0s)]
*  evidence where the C-SPAN archivist came up and they entered the tape of Trump to camera [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=485.0s)]
*  at a podium saying, this is going to cost me thousands of female votes. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=489.0s)]
*  This is going to poison me in the mind of the voters after Access Hollywood. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=493.0s)]
*  So the only thing that the jury has heard Trump say in five weeks is that the Access [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=496.0s)]
*  Hollywood tape is going to kill him with women voters. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=501.0s)]
*  That's all they've heard. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=504.0s)]
*  And so it's not, I wouldn't call it believable, even by the most fair standard, but for a [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=505.0s)]
*  hung jury to get one juror to say, you know, I don't remember it all that well. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=509.0s)]
*  People say all sorts of things. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=513.0s)]
*  I don't think this was for the campaign. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=514.0s)]
*  I don't even think it was that bad for the campaign. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=516.0s)]
*  That's what the lawyer said. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=519.0s)]
*  I think this was all about his family. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=520.0s)]
*  And then if you start projection, which is not the best thing, jurors aren't supposed [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=522.0s)]
*  to project. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=525.0s)]
*  They're supposed to use the evidence. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=526.0s)]
*  But a person projecting their own life might say, I could understand that not wanting that [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=527.0s)]
*  to come out. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=531.0s)]
*  I've never run for office. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=532.0s)]
*  And now we're now what are we talking about? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=533.0s)]
*  We're talking about the reasonable doubt of somebody's theories about family and not a [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=535.0s)]
*  campaign crime. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=539.0s)]
*  So I think that's the best way to look at it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=543.0s)]
*  I think that's the best way to look at it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gOX2SStMfU&t=546.0s)]
