# New Texts Reveal Republican's Openness To Dump Democracy To Keep Trump In Power: Report
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4)
*  The senior senator from the great state of Utah is a Republican named Mike Lee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=0.0s)]
*  He's held that job for a little over a decade and on January the 6th [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=5.04s)]
*  Just as the attack on the Capitol was getting started Senator Lee's cell phone rang [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=8.4s)]
*  Here is how he remembers it quote the caller ID indicated that the call was coming from the White House [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=12.64s)]
*  To my great surprise it was President Trump on the other end of the line [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=17.76s)]
*  There was a lot of noise and commotion in the room, but I thought I heard him say how's it going Tommy? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=21.8s)]
*  Tommy who's Tommy turns out the president dialed the wrong number [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=27.2s)]
*  He was looking for this guy Tommy Tuberville the newly elected senator from Alabama [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=30.84s)]
*  Senator Tuberville was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump's big lie [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=35.28s)]
*  And that's why the president was trying to call him on January the 6th to ask him to try and delay the certification of the election [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=38.68s)]
*  in Congress [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=45.14s)]
*  Instead the former president got Mike Lee on the phone by mistake and yes, Mike Lee is a Republican [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  But there was a reason that the president was not calling him on purpose to try and get him to go along [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=51.76s)]
*  With his scheme to overturn the election that day Senator Lee was not a vocal public proponent of Donald Trump's big lie [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=56.559999999999995s)]
*  He voted on January the 6th in favor of certifying the election results for Joe Biden [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=63.28s)]
*  Mike Lee told journalist Bob Woodward that he personally looked into some of Trump's claims of supposed voter fraud [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=68.0s)]
*  And did not think any of it checked out [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=73.6s)]
*  He says he disagreed with Trump's claim that Vice President Pence had the authority to stop the certification of the election [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=75.6s)]
*  By all public accounts Utah Senator Mike Lee portrayed himself as a proud defender of the constitution someone with absolute fidelity to it [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=82.72s)]
*  But it turns out in private Lee was actually just pushing for a different way to overturn the election [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=91.36s)]
*  Today CNN was first to obtain text messages that Senator Lee sent to the president's chief of staff Mark Meadows [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  In the few weeks after the election [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=103.44s)]
*  These are text messages that have been turned over to the January 6th investigation in Congress [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=105.68s)]
*  I should mention that NBC News has not yet obtained or verified these texts [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  In the messages Mike Lee repeatedly says that there is only one sure-fire way to overturn the election and it has nothing to do with [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=114.8s)]
*  Conspiracies about suitcases full of ballot papers or Italian satellites or Krakens [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  It's about the fake electus scheme the idea that states that actually went for Biden [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  Could submit a fake slate of electus to congress for Trump [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=132.96s)]
*  So that if Mike Pence refused to certify the results these fake Trump electors would be on record [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=136.72s)]
*  To flip the election in Trump's favor on December the 8th a few weeks after the election [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=142.08s)]
*  Mike Lee writes to mark Meadows Trump White House chief of staff at the time quote [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=146.96s)]
*  If a very small handful of states were to have their legislatures appoint alternative states of delegates [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=150.8s)]
*  There could be a path a month later [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=156.24s)]
*  He raises his concerns about the way his senate colleagues have gone about trying to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election results [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=158.8s)]
*  Mike Lee wants the president to know that his fake electus scheme has a much better shot of success [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  He says quote. I really think this could all backfire badly unless we have legislatures submitting trump slates later on that same day [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  He hits it again [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=177.84s)]
*  We need something from state legislatures to make this legitimate and to have any hope of winning [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=178.88s)]
*  Even if they can't convene it might be enough if a majority of them are willing to sign a statement [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=183.68s)]
*  Indicating how they would vote and i've been working on doing that all day today [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  Okay [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=192.42s)]
*  Here's why this matters so much right now [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=193.62s)]
*  The fake electus scheme is a play that republicans could very likely try to run again to overturn the election results in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=196.1s)]
*  2024 if the democrats win the white house again [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  It is truly shocking to hear a sitting member of the senate advocate advocate. Excuse me for such a plan [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=206.1s)]
*  Though actually maybe a little less surprising coming from senator Mike Lee given that he tweeted right before the 2020 election [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  That he does not believe the united states is a democracy [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  So what do we do to save our institutions when the people constitutionally tasked with protecting them are in fact the ones [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=224.26000000000002s)]
*  Who pose the biggest threat? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=231.78s)]
*  You [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C9sl5frZN4&t=248.9s)]
