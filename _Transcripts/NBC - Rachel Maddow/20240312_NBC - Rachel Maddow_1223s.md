# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 11
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o)
*  Do you remember when the right wing freaked out about Bud Light? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, they really freaked out about Bud Light. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  They were shooting Bud Light cans. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=7.12s)]
*  The right was very, very, very upset about Bud Light. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=9.72s)]
*  They were so mad. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  In Florida, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis got so excited about it, he ordered an official [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=14.42s)]
*  Florida state investigation into Bud Light. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=19.46s)]
*  In Congress, House Republicans started their own federal congressional investigation of [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=24.06s)]
*  Bud Light. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=30.02s)]
*  They have spent the better part of the past year on this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=31.02s)]
*  No longer would everyone in the country see Bud Light as the beer that is slightly more [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=34.62s)]
*  flavorful than Coors Light, but not quite as flavorful as Miller Light. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  But the Bud Light blue is kind of a pretty color, and sometimes it's on sale, so sometimes [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=42.82s)]
*  you buy it even if you're not in love with it, because no one's really in love with it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=46.58s)]
*  And hey, if you're drinking light beer, no one expects to be in love with that stuff anyway. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=49.5s)]
*  I mean, that's how we all used to think of Bud Light, admit it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=52.9s)]
*  But after nearly a year of right-wing culture war, no-holds-barred demagoguery against Bud [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=57.38s)]
*  Light, no longer would any self-respecting right-winger, would any self-respecting Republican [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=64.42s)]
*  buy Bud Light because it was on the end cap and came with a free koozie. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=70.34s)]
*  No, over the course of just under a year, Bud Light was transformed from a normal American [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=74.18s)]
*  thing you don't think much about into something very, very bad, something they would shoot [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=81.02s)]
*  on sight. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=85.69999999999999s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump, of course, jumped on board. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=88.5s)]
*  Money does talk. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=91.46s)]
*  Anheuser-Busch now understands that, he said, in a post-promoting right-wing boycotts of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=92.74s)]
*  companies that were seen to be liberal or liberal-seeming, or maybe if you squinted, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  they might feel a little liberal, but you're not sure why. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=105.34s)]
*  Bud Light, over the course of this past year, became a conservative target, became a Trump [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=109.54s)]
*  world bogeyman, until Donald Trump did a total 180. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=113.58s)]
*  Out of the blue, he decided unilaterally to call off the right-wing Jeremiah against Bud [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=120.7s)]
*  Light. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=126.86s)]
*  He told all his followers to start drinking Bud Light again. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=127.86s)]
*  Quote, Anheuser-Busch is a great American brand that deserves a second chance. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=131.22s)]
*  Now what caused this radical U-turn? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=137.7s)]
*  What caused the former president to turn on a dime like this? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=140.33999999999997s)]
*  The word dime is a help in this question, because if you put that Trump post back up [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=144.54s)]
*  there, the one where he says everybody should go back to drinking Bud Light, look at the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=150.1s)]
*  time and date stamp on that one. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=153.85999999999999s)]
*  Can we actually just make that part of it a little bigger? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=155.89999999999998s)]
*  You can see the stamp. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there we go. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=159.85999999999999s)]
*  All right, so keep that in mind. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=161.1s)]
*  3.30 p.m. on February 6th. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=163.38s)]
*  Why is that when Trump did his 180-degree U-turn on Bud Light? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=165.94s)]
*  Well, hmm. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=172.22s)]
*  Look what happened that same day. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=173.7s)]
*  Lobbyist for Anheuser-Busch announces $10,000 a plate fundraiser for Donald Trump. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=176.3s)]
*  So at 9.47 a.m., the lobbyist for Anheuser-Busch announces a $10,000 a plate fundraiser for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=181.78s)]
*  Trump, 9.47 a.m. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=188.46s)]
*  That same day at 3.30 p.m., Trump announces that he has changed his mind on Bud Light [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=191.06s)]
*  and conservatives should all drink Bud Light again. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=196.76s)]
*  That fundraiser was announced on February 6th. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=200.5s)]
*  It was actually held last week, Wednesday last week, but, you know, all Anheuser-Busch [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=203.94s)]
*  had to do was announce they were going to do the fundraiser to get Trump to do what [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=207.36s)]
*  they wanted, to get Trump to call off what had been a years-long conservative culture [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=210.88s)]
*  war top line issue. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=217.82s)]
*  Would you like the head of the Republican Party and the Republican Party's next nominee [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  to be president of the United States to do something for you? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Is there something you would like him to do for you or your company? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=230.1s)]
*  Perhaps you would consider opening your checkbook and swiveling your wrist. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=233.06s)]
*  Because that's apparently what it took to end the great right-wing Bud Light freakout [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=238.32s)]
*  of 2023 and 2024. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=242.68s)]
*  One fundraiser. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=245.56s)]
*  That's how that one sort of ended in fiasco. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=246.7s)]
*  But now behold, here comes the same process again. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=250.61999999999998s)]
*  Last week, end of last week, something happened in Washington that almost never happens anymore. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  There was a vote in Congress. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=258.3s)]
*  This was an actual policy and it's even on a somewhat controversial issue. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=260.38s)]
*  Nevertheless, the vote on this bill last week in Congress was 50 to nothing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=265.98s)]
*  Now this bill is on the issue of TikTok, social media app. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=272.14s)]
*  And whatever you think of TikTok or whether you think of TikTok at all, there have been [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=277.97999999999996s)]
*  bipartisan concerns that have been expressed for a long time that this very popular social [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=284.3s)]
*  media app could pose a national security threat in the United States because of links between [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=289.78s)]
*  the company that owns TikTok and the Chinese government. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=295.14s)]
*  I say there are widespread concerns about this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=299.58s)]
*  These have been manifest already in policy at lots of different levels. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=301.7s)]
*  Already if you are a federal government employee or contractor, if for work you have a phone [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=305.3s)]
*  or another device that belongs to the federal government, the federal government says you [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  are not allowed to install TikTok on that device. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=315.26s)]
*  In more than 30 states, there are similar bans on installing TikTok on any device that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  belongs to the state government. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  This bill that's racing through Congress would require app stores to remove TikTok. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=325.94s)]
*  So you can't download the app anymore. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=332.26s)]
*  The only contingency would be if the company was sold to a firm that didn't have links [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=336.34s)]
*  to the Chinese government, that didn't have links to Beijing. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=342.5s)]
*  Barring the company that runs TikTok being sold, TikTok would effectively be off the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=346.74s)]
*  market. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=350.74s)]
*  When Trump was president in the summer of 2020, he tried to ban TikTok unilaterally [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=352.02s)]
*  himself. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=357.74s)]
*  He tried to force the company to be sold. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=358.74s)]
*  He issued an executive order banning any American citizen from having any transaction with the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=361.26s)]
*  company that owns TikTok, which effectively would have banned the use of TikTok by anyone [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=366.78s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=371.14s)]
*  He tried that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=372.58s)]
*  He did that in the summer of 2020. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=373.58s)]
*  That executive order was eventually struck down by the courts, which is why TikTok is [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=375.74s)]
*  not banned right now. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=379.46s)]
*  But Trump was very clear on this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=382.29999999999995s)]
*  He made a huge issue out of TikTok being evil and bad and dangerous. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=383.41999999999996s)]
*  It had to be stopped. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=386.65999999999997s)]
*  He was going to stop it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  That was his stand. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=388.65999999999997s)]
*  Until until something happened. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=392.7s)]
*  Do we have that? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=395.7s)]
*  Do we have that cast register sound? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=396.7s)]
*  Did you guys find it? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=398.62s)]
*  Oh, suddenly he's just made a total U-turn. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=401.62s)]
*  I wonder why after after personally trying to ban TikTok, after railing against it and [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=407.38s)]
*  playing Mr. Tough Guy against TikTok for years now, trying to shut down this app in the United [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=413.74s)]
*  States, Trump has just come out and said, actually, we shouldn't get rid of TikTok. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=418.7s)]
*  That would be terrible. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=425.86s)]
*  Tick tock's actually got a lot going for it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=428.86s)]
*  He said so online on Thursday. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=431.06s)]
*  Now, today, he said it in an interview on CNBC. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=433.34s)]
*  There are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=438.3s)]
*  There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who who will go crazy without it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=440.78s)]
*  There are a lot of users. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=445.9s)]
*  There's a lot of good. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=447.62s)]
*  It's a lot of good. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=450.62s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=453.86s)]
*  All of a sudden, why the change? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=455.09999999999997s)]
*  Quote, some have noted that Trump recently hosted Jeff Yass at his Mar-a-Lago club in [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=457.66s)]
*  Florida. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=463.86s)]
*  Yass is a billionaire investor in ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, and Trump is [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=464.86s)]
*  seeking his support in the presidential race. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=469.66s)]
*  So follow the bouncing coin, if you will. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=474.54s)]
*  Step one, take very aggressive, very public position against foreign company. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=477.90000000000003s)]

*  If you would like the head of the Republican Party and the Republican Party's next nominee [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=512.8199999999999s)]

*  Anything is possible. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=524.78s)]
*  And if you don't believe me, take it from Trump's own folks. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=527.98s)]
*  This is the headline in Newsweek right now. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=530.42s)]
*  Quote, Steve Bannon suggests Donald Trump has been bought. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=532.62s)]
*  Steve Bannon, former adviser to Donald Trump, suggested on Saturday that the former president [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=538.86s)]
*  was paid off after a shift in his stance on TikTok. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=542.9000000000001s)]
*  When even Steve Bannon is like, this guy appears to be for sale. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=547.94s)]
*  Steve Bannon right now has been sentenced to prison for a massive. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=552.34s)]

*  Steve Bannon has been put up on charges had to be pardoned by Trump for an alleged massive [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=565.1800000000001s)]
*  fraud scheme. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=569.62s)]
*  Steve Bannon is going to be charged for that mass alleged massive fraud scheme in New York [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=571.38s)]
*  State Court. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=576.66s)]
*  And Steve Bannon is like, seems a little transactional. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=577.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=581.66s)]
*  This guy appears to be for sale. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=582.66s)]
*  If Steve Bannon is saying you appear to be a little fraughty, a little for sale, a little [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=585.38s)]
*  transactional, that means you have ceased to be subtle about it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=591.62s)]
*  There is a lot that is going on in Republican politics right now, which is not the way things [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=596.42s)]
*  usually go in politics. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=600.24s)]
*  There's a lot of overlap between like crime and politics, prison and politics. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=601.6s)]
*  But as politico.com reports tonight on the quote bloodbath at the RNC with Trump's people [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=610.48s)]
*  finally taking over as of this weekend and now as of today, they are firing dozens of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=617.6s)]
*  people who work at the Republican National Committee with confirmation that there is [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=621.52s)]
*  no longer even an effort to stop the National, the Republican National Committee from paying [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=625.4s)]
*  Trump's personal legal expenses out of the Republican Party coffers. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  We are in a place where the entire Republican Party apparatus is merging with Trump's personal [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=635.28s)]
*  legal defense apparatus. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  And the way he has been behaving when it comes to being transactional at his time of most [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=645.36s)]
*  desperate financial need puts us, no matter how you think of Trump, no matter whether [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=651.8s)]
*  you support him or not, no matter whether you care about politics or not, it puts us, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  the American people, in a radically fragile place when it comes to what exactly is for [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=661.4799999999999s)]
*  sale in our country and from our government. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=666.16s)]
*  I mean, Bud Light and TikTok seem to have figured out very early on where exactly you [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=669.56s)]
*  insert the coins to receive your prize. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=674.56s)]
*  But if anything is for sale, right, if everything is for sale, what makes you think it's going [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=681.4s)]
*  to stop with thin beer and Chinese social media apps? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=686.8199999999999s)]
*  Everything must go. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=692.72s)]
*  Everything's for sale. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=695.04s)]
*  Anybody who can pay can get what they want. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=696.9599999999999s)]
*  And you wonder why guys like this always want to undermine the rule of law, right? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=700.4s)]
*  On Friday, Donald Trump had to put up cash and collateral for a $91 million bond in the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=707.12s)]
*  New York case in which he was found liable for repeatedly defaming E. Jean Carroll by [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=712.16s)]
*  making what the court concluded were false claims that he had not sexually assaulted [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=717.44s)]
*  her. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=721.2s)]
*  Two weeks from today, he will have to put up cash and collateral for a bond that is [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=722.2s)]
*  closer to half a billion dollars in the case where his real estate business was found to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=725.48s)]
*  have engaged in years and years of fraud. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=730.4s)]
*  And we've been looking at that. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=733.8s)]
*  I think the frame on that has been that this is a difficult and dangerous time for Donald [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=735.4s)]
*  Trump right now. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=739.08s)]
*  But because of the position that he's in, that makes this a difficult and dangerous [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=740.08s)]
*  thing for us as a country right now, because he's got to put up bonds for over $500 million [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=744.28s)]
*  worth of court judgments right now within the next two weeks. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=749.96s)]
*  He's put up already just under $100 million of that, still another $400-plus million to [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=754.72s)]
*  go very soon. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=759.04s)]
*  He does not appear to have the cash and assets and collateral to pay for those bonds, to [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=762.4s)]
*  put up what he needs to put up for those bonds without considerable strain, if he even can [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=768.56s)]
*  cobble anything together to bolster those bonds in total. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=773.76s)]
*  So he desperately needs money. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=778.8s)]
*  I mean, right now. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=781.52s)]
*  That bond, the half billion dollar bond, that's two weeks from today. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=783.62s)]
*  And he needs that money so urgently right now while he is openly changing his publicly [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=787.4s)]
*  held, long-held, supposedly heartfelt policy positions in ways that appear to be just straight [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=795.88s)]
*  up responsiveness to financial incentives. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=801.4s)]
*  On the bond he paid already and the huge one he's got to put up for within the next two [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  weeks, there is no public transparency into who might be co-signing with him or otherwise [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=813.92s)]
*  underwriting these bonds. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=821.04s)]
*  Somebody helping him put up the cash and collateral for these bonds? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=823.9599999999999s)]
*  If so, what are they getting in exchange for their generosity to him? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=826.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, we know the name of the bonding company that put up the $91 million bond for the E.G. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=830.9599999999999s)]
*  Carroll case, but we don't know if it was Trump alone or Trump and some helpers who [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=836.8s)]
*  put up the cash and collateral necessary to obtain that bond from that company. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=841.62s)]
*  We have asked Mr. Trump this evening if he will tell us if there were co-signers or anyone [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=846.46s)]
*  otherwise assisting him in obtaining that bond. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=851.78s)]
*  We have not yet heard back from him. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=854.44s)]
*  We will let you know if we do. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=855.86s)]
*  But in national security terms, this is a profoundly dangerous thing, regardless of [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=858.34s)]
*  what it means for him personally and politically. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=863.32s)]
*  It's a dangerous thing for us as a country. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=865.3s)]
*  I mean, think about if you needed to get a security clearance for work, right? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=867.86s)]
*  You wanted to get a security clearance. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=873.02s)]
*  But when you applied for that clearance, the FBI did their background check on you and [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=875.42s)]
*  they became aware that you were in this much need of this much money this urgently. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=880.06s)]
*  If you were applying for a security clearance right now and the FBI found that two weeks [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=886.34s)]
*  from today you need to put up cash and collateral to secure almost a half billion dollars of [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=892.86s)]
*  a bond to pay your court judgments, do you think you would get a security clearance? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=899.54s)]
*  There is no chance you would ever be approved for even the lowest level security clearance [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=906.0600000000001s)]
*  because the risk is just too obvious that you would be tempted to sell American secrets [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=910.54s)]
*  for this money that you so desperately need. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=916.4s)]
*  Whether or not you were known to be a particularly transactional kind of person, there's no [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=919.94s)]
*  way that wouldn't be seen as a massive national security risk. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=924.1s)]
*  Last week, Politico was first to report that Trump is about to start receiving classified [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=930.86s)]
*  intelligence briefings again. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=934.86s)]
*  Presidential candidates, major party nominees, always get these, at least they have historically. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=938.34s)]
*  But no one's ever received a classified briefing as a presidential candidate while he or she [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=944.22s)]
*  was awaiting trial in federal court on multiple felony charges of violating the Espionage [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=949.6s)]
*  Act by deliberately mishandling classified material. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=953.78s)]
*  And no, no one's ever received those kinds of briefings while they, quick, need to come [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=957.36s)]
*  up with a half billion dollars worth of cash and collateral to put up bonds to pay their [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=961.22s)]
*  court judgments. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=966.88s)]
*  In the days after Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed in an Arctic prison [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  in Russia, a Russian website that was made to look like a news outlet posted what it [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=975.2s)]
*  claimed was a leaked audio recording of two high-level U.S. State Department officials [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=979.84s)]
*  discussing who should replace Navalny as leader of the Russian opposition. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=985.4000000000001s)]
*  The implication, of course, was that there's no real Russian opposition to Vladimir Putin, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=990.0200000000001s)]
*  that anybody in Russia who's opposed to Putin must be part of an American front, must be [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=995.08s)]
*  part of what is, in effect, a U.S. government creation. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=999.0400000000001s)]
*  Like Navalny wasn't a real resistance leader, he wasn't a real opposition figure, he was [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1002.52s)]
*  just a tool of the American government, and they'd pick a new one to replace him now. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1007.3199999999999s)]
*  This supposedly leaked audio was so obviously fake, it would fool exactly no one. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1013.04s)]
*  A State Department official told the Daily Beast, which broke the story, quote, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1019.28s)]
*  In case the thick Russian accents pretending to be U.S. officials were not clear, yes, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1023.68s)]
*  we can confirm this audio is fake. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1028.28s)]
*  But still, it doesn't have to appear to be all that real, you launder it, right? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1032.52s)]
*  You say it's been cited here, you describe it here, you move it into another fake news [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1037.8s)]

*  If you searched the names of the people in this story, the U.S. government officials [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1047.8400000000001s)]

*  I'm not sure the tagline Florida news since 1937. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1074.3200000000002s)]
*  But this Chronicle has existed for less than a month and it's created by Russians. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1079.48s)]
*  So is this very similar looking one, not the famous New York Daily News, but instead the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1086.1200000000001s)]
*  New York News Daily. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1090.68s)]
*  Also here's another one, the Chicago Chronicle. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1093.72s)]
*  That sounds like it could be a real paper. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1096.6000000000001s)]
*  It's not. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1098.44s)]
*  Or this one, the DC Weekly. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1099.44s)]
*  All of these different sites have the same mix of AI generated stories on right wing [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1102.28s)]
*  hot button issues like crime and immigration, plus a whole slew of stories advancing the [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1107.08s)]
*  Kremlin line on the war in Ukraine. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1112.84s)]
*  Not long ago, the DC Weekly site posted an entirely made up story about Ukraine's President [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1116.6s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky spending tens of millions of dollars on a pair of yachts, yachts for [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1122.44s)]
*  himself. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1129.12s)]
*  The story was total bullpucky, but it's perfectly designed to spread on social media as if it [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1130.36s)]
*  were from some real news site, which it is not. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1135.8s)]
*  At least one Republican member of Congress and one Republican senator then cited the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1139.56s)]
*  fake yachts as a reason to oppose approving any more funding for Ukraine's Republican [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1144.4399999999998s)]
*  Senator J.D. Vance, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1151.0s)]
*  And while that's hilarious about them, in all seriousness, Ukraine funding is still [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1156.64s)]
*  being blocked by Republicans in Congress. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1161.8400000000001s)]
*  These very obvious Russian fake news sites are proliferating right now. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1166.24s)]
*  And again, they are not sophisticated. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1171.24s)]
*  You spend just a few seconds on one of these sites and you quickly realize this is not, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1172.8000000000002s)]
*  say, a newspaper that has been bringing you Florida news since 1937. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1176.8000000000002s)]
*  But these efforts do not have to be sophisticated to spread disinformation effectively. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1181.22s)]
*  You just launder it. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1186.52s)]
*  You just spread it around. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1187.52s)]
*  You say you've seen it somewhere else. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1188.52s)]
*  You get the government to comment on it. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1191.16s)]
*  If you can just get it into the bloodstream, if you can just lend a sort of aura of credibility [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1193.36s)]
*  to posts flying by on any social media feed, mission accomplished. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWES2vPMV8o&t=1198.72s)]
