# Rachel Maddow blows up myth of big business support for Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI)
*  the preferences of the business class and the donation behavior of the the uber wealthy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=0.0s)]
*  is getting attention also right now not just because of its effect on sort of the odds in the race the the likelihood of each of these candidates to win. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=9.0s)]
*  I think it's also getting attention because of the substance of it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=18.0s)]
*  Right. We have an incumbent president and somebody who was the last president. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=21.0s)]
*  So they both have a term in office that we can look at that we can measure against one another. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=26.0s)]
*  They've both got observable records. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=34.0s)]
*  Why would business people be turning against Joe Biden on the basis of his record, which is what we keep being told in the press heading into this debate. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=36.0s)]
*  I mean, this is something there's where there again is is an observable truth here under Joe Biden. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=45.0s)]
*  We just had the best year of American job creation in the 21st century. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=51.0s)]
*  The last time we had a streak this long of unemployment below four percent. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=56.0s)]
*  It was the early 1960s under Joe Biden. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=60.0s)]
*  The U.S. has the best economy in the world, literally the envy of the world. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=64.0s)]
*  In fact, the World Bank just said that the U.S. economy is so good. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=71.0s)]
*  It's actually stabilizing the whole world economy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=75.0s)]
*  The U.S. stock market keeps hitting new records and then breaking those records and then hitting new ones that are even higher. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=78.0s)]
*  Crime is at 50 year lows. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=85.0s)]
*  We just have the largest single year drop in the murder rate that we have ever recorded. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=87.0s)]
*  And President Biden keeps passing, keeps signing big legislation that's good for the economy, that's good for the business climate. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=92.0s)]
*  And he has been able to do it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=100.0s)]
*  He's been able to do it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=101.0s)]
*  Miracle of all miracles with bipartisan support. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=102.0s)]
*  And that includes the big infrastructure bill and domestic manufacturing of computer trips and all of these other all of these other things. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=106.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the kind of business landscape hellscape business leaders have been suffering through under Joe Biden. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=114.0s)]
*  Headlines like these corporate profits hit record high as economy boomed in fourth quarter of 2023. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=122.0s)]
*  Or this one. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=128.0s)]
*  U.S. corporate profits soar with margins at widest since 1950. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=129.0s)]
*  Or this one. Money watch. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=134.0s)]
*  U.S. companies just had their best years since before most of us before most of us were born. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=135.0s)]
*  Oh, the poor business guys. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=143.0s)]
*  They really need Trump back, don't they? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=145.0s)]
*  And even even if they want to say, oh, it's not about the business climate, it's about being fiscally responsible. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=148.0s)]
*  It's just that we're so worried about the debt and the deficit. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=153.0s)]
*  And that's why we want to go back to Trump and get rid of Joe Biden. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=156.0s)]
*  I mean, tell me what the rationale is there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=160.0s)]
*  In reality, tell me what the rationale is, because the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, one of these nonpartisan fiscal watchdog groups, put this out today, which kind of puts a fine point on it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=163.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=176.0s)]
*  That's that's who added what to the debt when you compare Trump's term in office with Joe Biden's term in office. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=177.0s)]
*  And no, you can't blame covid. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=184.0s)]
*  They actually break out the covid spending. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=186.0s)]
*  That's the bit in the lighter red color there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=188.0s)]
*  So, yes, Donald Trump and Joe Biden both spent on the camp on the pandemic. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=190.0s)]
*  They had to. But even if you wipe that out, Trump added trillions more to the debt and the deficit than Biden did, regardless of covid. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=194.0s)]
*  And maybe you don't particularly care about the deficit and the debt, but business guys almost always say they do. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=203.0s)]
*  And so what's the rationale along those lines for supporting Trump over Biden? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=211.0s)]
*  As we head into this weird early debate this week, supporters of of this business genius created an impression that Trump's gotten advantage heading into the debate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=218.0s)]
*  At this point in the campaign, because his business record, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=231.0s)]
*  He's so appealing to all the other rich business guys who so appreciate how smart you need to be to book a guy with vampire teeth for your cage match business. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=235.0s)]
*  They are trying to create an impression that there is support for Trump in the business world because there's economic and business reasons to support someone who himself is so good at business. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=244.0s)]
*  In reality, the actual stakes in this election, the comparative record of these two candidates on the economy and business, those it doesn't favor the failed promoter of the Affliction Mixed Martial Arts League, which promoted exactly two bouts before it folded. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=256.0s)]
*  And the man whose surviving company was convicted on multiple felony fraud counts and was named in his own felony criminal trial for falsification of business records. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=272.0s)]
*  And by the way, his CFO is currently doing his second stint in prison. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=281.0s)]
*  Weirdly, his business record, his business environment record, his job creation record, his economic and fiscal record on the facts. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=285.0s)]
*  Doesn't support the idea that he should be winning support from people who prioritize those things. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=295.0s)]
*  Despite the massive spin generated by all these high profile ideological Trumpy billionaires, we're starting now, finally, as of today, I think, to see a corrective in that narrative about what's really happening. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=301.0s)]
*  This is the front page of the New York Times tonight. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=315.0s)]
*  quote, CEOs are frustrated. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=318.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean they that doesn't mean they embrace Trump. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=322.0s)]
*  Quote, a number of prominent figures in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street have grown increasingly vocal in their criticism of Mr. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=326.0s)]
*  Biden, their praise of former President Donald J. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=333.0s)]
*  Trump or both. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=335.0s)]
*  Still, that shift mostly reflects movement among executives who already supported Republican politicians. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=336.0s)]
*  Quote, there is little evidence of a major shift in allegiance among executives away from Biden and toward Trump. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=344.0s)]
*  It's on the front page. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=351.0s)]
*  This is on the op-ed page today. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=353.0s)]
*  Quote, recent headlines suggest that our nation's business leaders are embracing the presidential candidate, Donald Trump. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=355.0s)]
*  His campaign would have you believe that our nation's top chief executives are returning to support Trump for president, touting declarations of support from some prominent financiers. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=361.0s)]
*  It is far from the truth, though. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=371.0s)]
*  They didn't flock to him before, and they certainly aren't flocking to him now. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=373.0s)]
*  Quote, Trump continues to suffer from the lowest level of corporate support in the history of the Republican Party. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=377.0s)]
*  Quote, not a single Fortune 100 chief executive has donated to Trump so far this year, which indicates a major break from the overwhelming business and executive support for Republican presidential candidates that dates back over a century. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=383.0s)]
*  Trump received a, quote, frigid reception when he spoke to the Business Roundtable this month with no noticeable applause at any point during his, quote, remarkably meandering remarks, according to CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin, and with Trump assuming a subdued, if not hostile posture. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=396.0s)]
*  Chief executives are not protectionist, isolationist, or xenophobic, and they believe in investing where there is the rule of law, not the law of rulers. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=416.0s)]
*  Whether or not business support is going to make the difference for either one of these candidates in November. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=428.0s)]
*  Heading into this debate this week, there has been a concerted effort to create a perception, a false perception, that Trump has the whole business world lining up behind him. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=436.0s)]
*  And that's because his time in office compared favorably with President Biden, which is not true on fiscal issues. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=446.0s)]
*  It is not true in the overall business climate. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=454.0s)]
*  It is not true on jobs, and it is not true in terms of business leaders lining up behind these two candidates. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=456.0s)]
*  But that kind of false perception itself has political consequences. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=462.0s)]
*  And heading into this debate and all the attention it's going to get about the relative strengths of these two candidates and what they have to offer, what they have to offer, excuse me, more than ever, it is worth getting these things right. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=467.0s)]
*  Joining us now is my dear friend and colleague Stephanie Rolch. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=480.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=485.0s)]
*  I am in awe of your lead-in. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=486.0s)]
*  You have laid out exactly the sort of economic landscape of what we're looking like here. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=489.0s)]
*  And one of the main reasons you're seeing sort of this Trump narrative that all these business leaders are backing me, because remember, the number one thing they want to try to push and convince people of is that the economy is terrible. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=494.0s)]
*  And while inflation is a persistent problem, business leaders are not standing with Donald Trump. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=507.0s)]
*  And that business roundtable meeting, it's really important for our audience to understand. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=512.0s)]
*  Trump would have you believe, corporate America invited me in. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=517.0s)]
*  They wanted me to speak to them. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=521.0s)]
*  It was their normal meeting that they have every year, and they invited both candidates. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=523.0s)]
*  President Biden could not attend because he was at the G7, and his chief of staff, Jeff Zients, was there. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=528.0s)]
*  And Donald Trump has said since then, they were clapping for me at the end. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=535.0s)]
*  They were, because it was at the end of a presidential candidate's remarks, and that is what a room does who's marginally courteous. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=539.0s)]
*  But you just mentioned the reporting from Andrew Ross Sorkin. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=548.0s)]
*  I spoke to other people who basically said this thing was all over the place, and it is a break. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=551.0s)]
*  Pre-Donald Trump, the business community, sort of the C-suite class, was with the Republican Party. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=556.0s)]
*  You remember that Al Smith dinner years ago when George H.W. Bush kind of jokingly looked out at the room of business leaders in New York and said, you're my base. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=564.0s)]
*  That's not the case anymore. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=573.0s)]
*  It was after Charlottesville you saw the first business council in American history break from a president and say, I can't even be associated with him anymore. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=575.0s)]
*  Steph, one of the reasons that I think this is important heading into the debate is because I'm not a person who knows a ton about the business world. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=586.0s)]
*  I definitely don't think of myself as sharing all the same values as CEOs and people on Wall Street and people who think of, you know, who read the business section first and maybe don't even read the politics page. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=594.0s)]
*  I don't think of myself that way, but I also know politics reasonably well. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=604.0s)]
*  And I feel like the perceptions of who the business community is with is an important thing even for people who aren't themselves in the business world, right? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=609.0s)]
*  Because you start to think, oh, well, these business people are smart. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=618.0s)]
*  They must know who's going to be economically better for the country. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=622.0s)]
*  And that's, I believe, why they're trying to create this perception. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=625.0s)]
*  And that's why it's important for us to report if that perception is false. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=628.0s)]
*  Rachel, it's especially important this year because we've had this division, right? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=632.0s)]
*  All of the positive economic data that you just laid out is disconnected from how people feel because people haven't been feeling good about the economy because they're coming off of COVID because of persistent inflation. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=636.0s)]
*  So when you keep pushing this narrative that the business community is standing with Donald Trump, it convinces people, well, maybe bad news is coming. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=648.0s)]
*  But here's what's important. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=655.0s)]
*  There are there is sort of a subgroup of sort of very, very successful Wall Street financiers. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=657.0s)]
*  You know, there's Elon Musk and kind of Elon Musk backup dancers who have been very pro and outspoken Trump, pro Trump in the last few weeks. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=663.0s)]
*  And I want to explain why they know how good the economy is. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=672.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and all that Joe Biden has done for electric vehicles, he certainly knows how good the economy is. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=675.0s)]
*  He knows how good the stock market is. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=681.0s)]
*  However, they know that Donald Trump is transactional. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=683.0s)]
*  They know that if they stand with Donald Trump now, if they're throwing fundraisers for him, that if in fact he becomes the president, they're going to have a direct line into the Oval Office. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=687.0s)]
*  So it's as though they're trying to recreate kind of a Putin's oligarchs here. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8dMmzGwIZI&t=697.0s)]
