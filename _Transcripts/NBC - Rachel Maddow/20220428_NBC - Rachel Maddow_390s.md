# Maddow: Republican War On Journalism Part Of A Tactic Worth Recognizing
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk)
*  Our own political right is quite deep into its, you know, the press is the enemy of the people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=0.0s)]
*  phase. This weekend is the White House Correspondents Association dinner, which the last president [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=7.36s)]
*  didn't go to his whole time in office and not just because of COVID. It's because the last [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=12.56s)]
*  president literally campaigned against there being a free press. He literally campaigned on that enemy [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=16.88s)]
*  of the people phrase, which he borrowed from Stalin. This weekend, for the first time in three [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=22.56s)]
*  years, the correspondence dinner is back on after being shut for COVID. The Biden White House is [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=27.76s)]
*  getting a little bit of a hard time, understandably, about the fact that President Biden is planning to [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=33.28s)]
*  go to the dinner in person. It's understandable that they're getting a hard time for that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=38.64s)]
*  It's a controversial decision. It's going to be like 2000 plus people in an indoor ballroom. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=42.96s)]
*  The president is 79. The vice president currently right now already has COVID. I mean, I get it [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=47.36s)]
*  in terms of why COVID concerns are enough to make you maybe not want to see President Biden [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=53.44s)]
*  attend this event in person this weekend. On the other hand, I see the other side. It does mean [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=58.16s)]
*  something and something important in this moment now, both domestically and for our role in the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=63.04s)]
*  world. It means something for a U.S. president to show up, to stand for the press, to stand with the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=68.48s)]
*  press, even as the press, I'm sure, drives this president just as bananas as we have every other [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=74.0s)]
*  president and politician since the dawn of time. That's what we do. But right now, it's particularly [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=80.0s)]
*  important for a U.S. president to stand with the press because there really is an opposing side here [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=87.12s)]
*  right from the other side of American politics. Now, you know, we have a lot of fake news back [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=95.6s)]
*  there, these fakers. I'm talking about the fake news media. They are truly an enemy of the people. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=101.68s)]
*  The fake news media right back there. It's the enemy of the people. Our media is the enemy of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=109.52s)]
*  the people. It's very, very dangerous what they do. The repetition is part of the point here. The [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=118.64s)]
*  repetition is part of how that works. The repetition is how it stops seeming shocking and starts seeming [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  like something you've heard before, something that resonates. And that has sunk in. And doing that for [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=129.84s)]
*  that long, right, doing that for the last seven years, that has sunk in. That has changed things. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=135.52s)]
*  I mean, you know, at this point, there are not going to be any debates between the next two [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=141.52s)]
*  candidates in the next presidential election. The Republican Party says they're done. They're not [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  doing that anymore because, you know, whether or not the Republican Party's presidential candidate [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  next time around is going to be Donald Trump, the party itself has decided this year that they can [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  no longer abide the fact that it is reporters who ask questions at presidential debates. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=160.24s)]
*  And so therefore, there will be no presidential debates in 2024. It's a remarkable decision. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=165.68s)]
*  And it's on the basis of the fact that the press is involved in asking the questions. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=172.8s)]
*  The Republican Party can no longer abide that. It's less controversial. It's received way less [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=176.56s)]
*  attention than that. But in Republican controlled states this year, we've seen a whole rash of new [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=182.88s)]
*  rules and new restrictions put in place that ban reporters from covering state governments, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=188.4s)]
*  from covering state legislatures in Utah, in Kansas, in Iowa. When they decided to ban reporters [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  from the Iowa legislature this year, it broke what was otherwise a 140 year unbroken tradition. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=200.4s)]
*  For 140 years, it worked to have reporters in there asking legislators questions. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=206.56s)]
*  This year, with this Republican Party, that no longer works. Reporters are banned. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=210.56s)]
*  Last fall, the Republican governor of Missouri, Mike Parson, asked state law enforcement to pursue [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=215.28s)]
*  criminal charges against a local reporter in Missouri because that reporter reported accurately [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=219.84s)]
*  on a security flaw in the state's computer systems. The governor actually got state law [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=226.8s)]
*  enforcement to investigate that reporter for months as if there was some crime in that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=233.2s)]
*  reporting. They actually tried to bring charges against the reporter, but no prosecutor would [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=238.48s)]
*  do it. I didn't actually think it would get much worse than what we saw from Governor Mike Parson [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=242.96s)]
*  in Missouri, but then this week, hello California, the Fox News darling conservative sheriff of Los [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=248.24s)]
*  Angeles County convened a press conference in which he put a reporter's photo up on a big poster. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  He's pointing to it there with a pointy stick. The sign says, when did she know and when did she know it? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=259.12s)]
*  He pointed out that reporter who was in fact covering that press conference from the first [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=265.76s)]
*  row at that moment. He said she was going to be the subject of a criminal investigation for this [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=270.08s)]
*  dastardly reporting she was doing on scandals in the sheriff's office. In addition to putting up [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=274.24s)]
*  her photo, he put up a list of alleged crimes. He was pretty sure this reporter might have committed [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=280.24s)]
*  by doing this reporting on scandals in his office. Now we covered that story earlier this week here [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  on this show. We can report tonight that after a righteous and furious press conference, the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  sheriff is now pretending he never did that. It's one thing to change your mind and say, oh my bad, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=298.4s)]
*  I got carried away. Another thing to say, no, I didn't do that, you dastardly people for saying I did. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=303.36s)]
*  Let's all forget that happened. How about we don't? But this idea that there's a supposed terrible [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=310.08s)]
*  threat from the press, that reporters aren't just irritating to people in power but actually criminal, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=318.24s)]
*  that the free press is a threat that must be destroyed, physically destroyed. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=324.72s)]
*  I mean, this is something that we should get fluent in. I mean, this is an issue that is not [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=332.48s)]
*  hiding its light under a bushel, right? This is not something that you really have to go [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=338.88s)]
*  looking too hard for. I mean, on January 6th, they really did carve the phrase murder the media [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=342.72s)]
*  into the U.S. Capitol. They left that behind. Presumably they meant it. This is a thing we [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=349.35999999999996s)]
*  should be able to see clearly by now. Even when they're doing it in a way that's more stupid than [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=356.23999999999995s)]
*  scary, it's the same thing. It is a tactical pattern that we should see, recognize, and be [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=361.2s)]
*  able to discuss and be able to think clearly about. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=367.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI7538wxDhk&t=378.4s)]
