# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 24
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc)
*  So if you take the earth as a whole, if you look at all of the land on earth, it is worth [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=0.0s)]
*  remembering that more than 10% of all the land on earth is Russia. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=8.24s)]
*  Russia is enormous. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=15.76s)]
*  It is physically enormous, physically the largest nation on earth. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=16.76s)]
*  And it's not even close. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=20.88s)]
*  Russia is more than six and a half million square miles of land, more than six and a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=22.2s)]
*  half million. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=27.0s)]
*  No other country on earth is more than four million square miles. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=28.0s)]
*  It's just massive. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=32.6s)]
*  I mean, we're a big country, too. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=33.6s)]
*  We have, you know, four time zones coast to coast. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  Russia has 11 time zones. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=39.08s)]
*  And yet, despite that massive size, Russia has a teeny tiny little sclerotic backwards [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=41.92s)]
*  economy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=47.6s)]
*  They're the biggest country on earth. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=48.6s)]
*  They've got an economy considerably smaller than Italy's in terms of population, nominal [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=50.92s)]
*  GDP per capita. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  Russia's not just worse off than like us or Italy or any other country in Western Europe. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=58.76s)]
*  Russia is way below like Romania, way below Panama. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=64.2s)]
*  They're economically worse off than the Maldives and Palau per capita GDP. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=68.72s)]
*  And you know, yes, Russia has had the luck to be sitting on lots of oil and gas. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=76.84s)]
*  They have a totally non-competitive, unmodernized, technologically backward oil and gas industry [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=83.04s)]
*  to show for it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=88.4s)]
*  But that's really all they have in terms of an economy. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=89.98s)]
*  I mean, literally, their entire economic output is oil and gas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=92.56s)]
*  And even so, their oil and gas sector is so lame that whenever they want to do something [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=97.28s)]
*  more complicated than sticking a straw into the ground in Siberia, they have to find some [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  Western oil company to come in and build the technology for them to do it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=106.76s)]
*  The one thing they have, they barely even have. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=111.84s)]
*  Russia is a country with immense resources. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=114.92s)]
*  And the Russian people have a record of cultural and scientific achievement that any country [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=117.98s)]
*  on earth would kill for. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=122.12s)]
*  And yet, their leaders have taken that potential and just shredded it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=124.84s)]
*  Russia under its current leadership has devolved into a kleptocratic dictatorship where yes, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=132.72s)]
*  You know, technically there's a parliament, there's the Russian Duma, but really exists [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=138.84s)]
*  in name only. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  It's just basically an extension of Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  And yes, technically there is a judiciary in Russia, but also in name only. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=148.12s)]
*  It is also just an extension of Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=152.32s)]
*  And yes, technically, barely, but technically there are elections in Russia, but that fiction [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=156.16s)]
*  doesn't even really extend to in name only at this point, since Putin now just declares [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  opposition candidacies and opposition parties to be illegal. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=165.4s)]
*  So the people of Russia today are remarkably ill served by their increasingly isolated [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=171.68s)]
*  aging dictator who has over 20 years in power under his belt already. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  He's got plans for 20 more. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=184.76s)]
*  He has no plan for a successor and apparently no plan to release Russia from the suffocating [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=186.38s)]
*  that he has on that beleaguered country and the fates of its 144 million people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=192.84s)]
*  He has reduced his country to one that exports. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=199.44s)]
*  I said they only have one export. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Really they have two. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=204.12s)]
*  They export oil and gas and they export organized crime. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=205.12s)]
*  Great. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=208.64s)]
*  And now with each passing year, the world becomes increasingly capable of saying no, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=209.64s)]
*  at least to the oil and gas that he's selling. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  So what does he have left? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=218.68s)]
*  What else can he do? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=220.94s)]
*  For months now, the United States has been warning overtly publicly that Russian President [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=224.9s)]
*  Vladimir Putin was massing all those troops on the Ukrainian border for a reason that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  it wasn't for military exercises and it wasn't for any other reason. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=233.54s)]
*  He was planning to invade. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=237.14s)]
*  He was not only planning to invade, he was planning a large scale invasion, a full scale [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=239.06s)]
*  invasion with the aim of taking over Ukraine. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=243.46s)]
*  The United States has been warning about that explicitly for months. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=248.54s)]
*  Also for months, Russia has been denying it, denying they would ever even consider such [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=251.7s)]
*  a thing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=255.6s)]
*  The ambassador denying it, the foreign minister denying it, members of the Russian Duma denying [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  it, presenters on Russian state-run television denying it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=260.7s)]
*  Oh, how ridiculous for the United States to say such a provocative thing that we plan [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=263.94s)]
*  to invade Ukraine. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=268.56s)]
*  How ridiculous, how hilarious. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=270.46s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=271.9s)]
*  You can put that in your file to refer to if you ever forget in the future whether or [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=274.58s)]
*  not Russian government pronouncements should be taken as if they mean something. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=278.22s)]
*  They spent months denying this would happen and now of course it has happened. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=282.14000000000004s)]
*  The US government even publicly released intelligence about what kinds of false pretexts, what kind [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  of fake stories Russia was planning to make up about Ukraine to create a fake justification [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=294.76000000000005s)]
*  for why they needed to invade. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=300.12s)]
*  The United States said in advance, hey, Russia is going to make up some fake nonsense about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=302.3s)]
*  they're being mistreatment of Russian speaking people in eastern Ukraine. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=306.5s)]
*  They're going to make up something about that, about how they need to send in troops to rescue [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=310.38s)]
*  all these people who are being victimized somehow because the Ukrainian government is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  hurting its citizens somehow. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=318.06s)]
*  The US government warned in advance that this is what Russia would make up, that this is [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=320.4s)]
*  what they would claim to purportedly justify their invasion. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=324.34s)]
*  And then sure enough, like clockwork, that is exactly what Russia did. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=328.76s)]
*  They announced war on Ukraine saying that Russian troops were only entering because [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=332.82s)]
*  they needed to, it was forced upon them. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=337.3s)]
*  They needed to step in as peacekeepers to stop some mythical crimes being committed [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  by the Ukrainian government against Russian speaking Ukrainians in the eastern part of [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=344.46s)]
*  that country. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=347.86s)]
*  It is a baldly false pretext and it is one that we knew to expect. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=349.74s)]
*  It's not the real reason Putin invaded. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=357.38s)]
*  Why did Putin invade? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=360.86s)]
*  Why is he doing this? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=362.48s)]
*  Why is this happening? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=363.48s)]
*  Well if you were the kleptocratic dictator sitting on top of a country that you were [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  keeping poor and unhappy and backward with no plans to do anything but more of that for [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=370.56s)]
*  another few decades, how would you feel about a big culturally similar neighboring country [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=374.94s)]
*  where your population and their population had lots of family ties, lots of connection, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=383.8s)]
*  lots of overlap, lots of reason to identify with one another? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=387.8s)]
*  And in that large culturally similar neighboring country, they recently threw out the pro-Russia [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=391.12s)]
*  puppet leader that you had installed there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=398.08s)]
*  They took economic steps to ally themselves with Europe more than with you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=401.1s)]
*  They then elected by a huge margin a popular Russian speaking guy who wants ties with the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=405.18s)]
*  West and Europe and the United States, a new young charismatic leader who said the night [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=410.36s)]
*  he was elected that everybody in the former Soviet states should look at his election [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=415.18s)]
*  and know that anything is possible, that anything is possible even in the former Soviet world [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=419.53999999999996s)]
*  thanks to democracy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=425.29999999999995s)]
*  How does that look to you if you're Vladimir Putin? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=429.78s)]
*  From the corner that Vladimir Putin has painted himself into in the country he has ruined, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=433.78s)]
*  the threat posed by a free, democratic, Western minded modern Ukraine, that's like a skeleton [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=440.34s)]
*  hand that might grab you by the ankle if you let your foot drift too far off the edge [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=448.44s)]
*  of the bed at night. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=452.06s)]
*  Yes, it's true. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=454.44s)]
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin has delusions about being a new czar and remaking the Russian [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=458.44s)]
*  Empire and reconstituting the USSR, sure. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=463.2s)]
*  Fine. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=466.8s)]
*  But also outside of the fairy tale books, he also just can't let any country near him [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  work in a way that might indicate to the Russian people that they too ought to expect [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=475.44s)]
*  their country and their government to work for them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=481.56s)]
*  He needs his neighboring countries to be dependent on him, to be corrupt, and to be fundamentally [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=484.38s)]
*  disappointing to their people. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=489.94s)]
*  That's what he needs from the near abroad, from his neighboring countries, and from the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=492.4s)]
*  far abroad for us in the West. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=497.22s)]
*  He would please prefer us to be disunified, destabilized, and as disreputable as he can [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=499.8s)]
*  possibly make us. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=504.64s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason why Russia has been spending all of this time not only trying [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=505.64s)]
*  to upend the international Western led order, but he's specifically spending all of this [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=509.53999999999996s)]
*  time and energy supporting extremists and racists and separatists and otherwise destabilizing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=513.96s)]
*  movements inside Western countries. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=520.92s)]
*  From France to the UK to us in the United States. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=524.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=528.92s)]
*  It's not like he's doing a lot constructive in the world, but he's spending a lot of energy, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=531.76s)]
*  a lot of resources, he's taking a lot of risks to do anything he can to seed basically dislocation, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  disreputability, corruption, and the inability to perform as a democracy anywhere he can [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=547.24s)]
*  in the Western world, particularly in the countries that lead the West. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=555.36s)]
*  He wants disunity and disarray anywhere else in the world. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=559.36s)]
*  He wants disunity and disarray in the West in particular. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=563.32s)]
*  And nearby, he wants and needs not a sphere of influence, but a sphere of insulation around [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=567.8000000000001s)]
*  his own poorly run shambolic nation. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=575.2s)]
*  A sphere of insulation for himself and for what he's done to his country. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=578.84s)]
*  A sphere in which the governments of those other nearby nations also suck. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=584.7199999999999s)]
*  Leaders that also don't serve their people. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=589.9599999999999s)]
*  That answer to him. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  That are corrupt and manipulable and they offer nothing to their people. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=593.76s)]
*  Anything other than that, anything better than that, and the Russian people might start [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=599.3199999999999s)]
*  getting ideas about what their country should be like too. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=602.3599999999999s)]
*  If a government nearby to Russia proves to be anything other than a shambolic disgrace, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=605.3599999999999s)]
*  well, they've got to go. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=613.88s)]
*  And so Russia has started another war. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=617.84s)]
*  One of the rough truths of kleptocracy, of being a kleptocratic dictator, is that even [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=622.96s)]
*  very poor nations can produce very rich kleptocrats. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=630.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=634.28s)]
*  Even a very poor country. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=635.28s)]
*  If the guy at the top steals everything, the guy at the top is still going to be very rich. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=636.72s)]
*  You don't need a well-off country to make a well-off thief. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=640.8s)]
*  Sanctions that impose economic pain on Russia will ultimately impose no economic pain on him. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=646.4399999999999s)]
*  He will stay one of the richest men to have ever walked the face of the earth, no matter [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=652.64s)]
*  how much the rest of the Russian economy and the Russian people suffers. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=655.6999999999999s)]
*  And does he care about economic pain for his people? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, he doesn't really have to. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=662.4s)]
*  As long as he can sustain the dictatorship, he's not susceptible to any democratic consequences [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  from his own people's unhappiness. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=669.8s)]
*  I mean, what are they going to do? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=670.8s)]
*  Vote him out? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=672.16s)]
*  Look though, this was, I think, a piece of this today that not, that nobody could have [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=676.8s)]
*  predicted with confidence. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=684.7199999999999s)]
*  Look at the protests against what Putin did today inside Russia. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=687.16s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=693.16s)]
*  This is St. Petersburg, Russia today. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=694.16s)]
*  Look at all those people. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=695.16s)]
*  Russian authorities put out dire, dire warnings today threatening the Russian people that [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=698.88s)]
*  anybody demonstrating, anybody protesting, anybody saying anything against Putin's invasion [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=704.32s)]

*  But look, look at the people turning out in St. Petersburg, in Moscow. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=714.96s)]
*  I mean, here's the lead story tonight in the Associated Press. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=718.6800000000001s)]
*  Dateline Moscow shocked Russians, turned out by the thousands today, to decry their country's [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=722.1600000000001s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine as emotional calls for protests grew on social media. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=727.48s)]
*  Some 1,745 people in 54 different Russian cities were arrested today. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=731.9599999999999s)]
*  54 different Russian cities? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=739.3199999999999s)]
*  At least 957 arrests today in Moscow alone. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=745.16s)]
*  The Russian people have no say in the behavior of their government under the Putin dictatorship. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=751.76s)]
*  He has criminalized standing against him in elections. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=757.8000000000001s)]
*  He's criminalized even journalism about him. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=760.6s)]
*  He has criminalized human rights work. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=762.84s)]
*  He has criminalized history. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=764.72s)]
*  He has criminalized all protest. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=766.48s)]
*  A single person standing holding a single protest sign is considered to be a riot in [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=768.72s)]
*  Moscow. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=773.88s)]
*  And yet the Russian people, by the thousands, by the thousands, still took to the streets [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=775.44s)]
*  today to say no, they can't bear it. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=780.5600000000001s)]
*  They cannot bear him starting this war. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=782.12s)]
*  So far, Europe and the rest of the Western world has been quite unified, surprisingly [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=787.2s)]
*  unified in its response to Putin's aggression toward Ukraine. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=792.48s)]
*  If you were going to be critical of lots of things about the Biden administration right [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=796.8000000000001s)]
*  now, uniting the world against what Putin is doing here is not something that you can [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=801.6800000000001s)]
*  criticize them from. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=805.6s)]
*  They have pulled that off. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=806.6s)]
*  But it's not that it won't be challenged. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=809.8000000000001s)]
*  This mounting refugee crisis, which we started to see take shape today, it does have the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=811.2800000000001s)]
*  potential to destabilize some of that unification, right? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=816.92s)]
*  The strain of widespread humanitarian disaster, the need of other nations around the Ukraine [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=820.5999999999999s)]
*  crisis to adapt, to essentially come to the rescue, that creates political, diplomatic, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=827.36s)]
*  ultimately economic difficulties. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=833.1999999999999s)]
*  That coalition is mission critical right now for any chance of countering Russia's blitz [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=835.52s)]
*  through Ukraine. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=839.16s)]
*  How do you retain that unity as we start to see these challenges build almost immediately [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=840.78s)]
*  as soon as the missiles started flying? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=845.92s)]
*  Joining us now is former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=849.24s)]
*  He was in that role, ambassador, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=852.8s)]
*  Ambassador McFaul, it's really good to see you tonight. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=858.12s)]

*  I'm really glad you're able to be here. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=860.8s)]
*  Glad to be here, Rachel. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=862.28s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=865.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=866.48s)]
*  Let me just ask you first for how you are feeling, how you, as somebody who's been watching [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=868.16s)]
*  this so closely, as somebody who has lived through a smaller version of this before in [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=874.52s)]
*  terms of what happened in 2014, how are you feeling watching what's happening in Ukraine? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=878.48s)]
*  What is your overall reaction to what Putin has done and what he's been able to pull off [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=884.04s)]
*  thus far? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=889.12s)]
*  Well, my first reaction is I'm incredibly sad. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=891.36s)]
*  Rachel, I have lots of friends in Ukraine. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=895.5600000000001s)]
*  Hundreds of people have trained in our various programs here at Stanford. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=899.16s)]
*  I used to go there often. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=902.16s)]
*  And when they started to attack last night, I was on various platforms talking to Ukrainians, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=904.36s)]
*  some of them now rather prominent Ukrainians in government and other places. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=910.9200000000001s)]
*  And it was terrifying to watch my friends react to what was going on. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=914.1600000000001s)]
*  And for all the unity you just talked about, and it has been really remarkable unity that [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=920.24s)]
*  the Biden administration has put together, one of my friends said very pointedly, I can't [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=924.72s)]
*  believe we have to fight this. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=929.7600000000001s)]
*  And then she used a word I'm not going to use on TV. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=932.0s)]
*  It begins with be alone. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=934.2s)]
*  And Ukrainians are alone. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=937.8s)]
*  Despite all those things, all the solidarity, at the end of the day, Ukrainians are driving [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=939.6s)]
*  to Lviv. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=944.16s)]
*  They're picking up weapons. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=945.28s)]
*  They're in metro stations alone. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=946.92s)]
*  They are fighting Russia alone. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=948.88s)]
*  So that's my first reaction. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=950.52s)]
*  My second reaction is anger. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=951.88s)]
*  I want to tell you honestly, I am angry at this evil act by this evil leader attacking [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=953.24s)]
*  an innocent nation, a democratic nation, and he's attacking them because they are a democratic [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  nation. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=965.2s)]
*  That's what this is about. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=966.2s)]
*  He is trying to undermine what the Ukrainians call the Revolution of Dignity. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=967.2s)]
*  Back in 2014, he has been angry about it ever since, Vladimir Putin. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=972.12s)]
*  And he finally, and he said it very bluntly. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=976.9200000000001s)]
*  I listened to his speech. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=978.72s)]
*  He said it very bluntly. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=979.84s)]
*  We're going to go in to do two things. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=981.36s)]
*  One to destroy Ukrainian military and two to denazify. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=983.08s)]
*  That was the word he used. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=988.8s)]
*  Of course, that's not the right word. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=989.8s)]
*  There are no Nazis ruling Ukraine. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=991.2s)]
*  But what he means by that is he's going in to overthrow Mr. Zelensky and his regime. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=994.16s)]
*  And there's intelligence reports that they're going to round up and arrest and perhaps kill [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=999.6s)]
*  the people that were the peaceful protesters that launched that Maidan revolution, that [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1004.24s)]
*  Revolution of Dignity back in 2013, 2014. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1009.56s)]
*  So I'm angry about that. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1013.3199999999999s)]
*  The way you're describing that and those historical references, I think, to me, have been lining [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1017.36s)]
*  up in a way that raises one very big question. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1022.24s)]
*  When we saw in 2008 when Putin waged war against Georgia, we saw him denounce the leader of [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1025.0s)]
*  Georgia as a Nazi. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1034.0s)]
*  I remember they hacked the website of the Georgian leader, Georgian president, and put [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1035.28s)]
*  up all these pictures of him looking like Hitler. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1042.44s)]
*  They made trying to create this case that he's some sort of Nazi, just like they're [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1046.12s)]
*  making that preposterous case about President Zelensky and the Ukrainian government today. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1049.2399999999998s)]
*  You were in Russia as ambassador when he took and annexed, when he invaded and took Crimea [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1056.32s)]
*  and took other portions of eastern Ukraine in 2014. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1063.52s)]
*  And I remember in 2008, I remember John McCain running for president saying, we are all Georgians [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1068.4399999999998s)]
*  now, and talking about the unity that that brought, that the rejection of that aggression [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1073.32s)]
*  from Putin brought not only to the Americans on all sides of the political system, but [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1077.96s)]
*  to the entire West. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1082.6s)]
*  I remember the international outrage in 2014 when Putin did what he did. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1083.96s)]
*  And I remember the sanctions, not only from the United States, not only from the European [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1089.28s)]
*  Union, but from a unified Western field of sanctions that really bit in Russia in terms [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1094.12s)]
*  of making real economic consequences. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1100.52s)]
*  And yet here he is again. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1103.66s)]
*  And this time, maybe he's going to try to take all of Ukraine and who knows how long [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1105.34s)]
*  he's going to try to hold it for, if not permanently. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1108.78s)]
*  It feels like sanctions is the big idea from the West and the sanctions are getting tougher. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1112.44s)]
*  And there will be, I imagine, even more announced in further days. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1117.56s)]
*  But it feels like that's sort of baked in to Putin's calculations at this point, that [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1120.64s)]
*  he doesn't think that sanctions are important enough to stop him from doing anything he [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1126.6399999999999s)]
*  wants to do. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1130.6s)]
*  And yet it seems like it's the strongest weapon that gets wielded against him. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1131.9599999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1137.12s)]
*  We talk a lot about sanctions because that's the instrument we're willing to use. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1138.26s)]
*  There are other instruments that we're not willing to use. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1141.9599999999998s)]
*  I think rightly, by the way, I agree with President Biden, but that means we focus on [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1143.8s)]
*  that. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1147.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think we make a miscalculation when we talk about sanctions. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1148.6799999999998s)]
*  And I want to be crystal clear. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1151.8799999999999s)]
*  I support what the president announced today. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1153.52s)]
*  I would go farther if he wants to do 100 percent sanctions. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1156.36s)]
*  I want to do 110. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1159.48s)]
*  And I hope there's more to come. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1161.08s)]
*  At the same time, we need to be realistic and understand that this is a dictatorship [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1163.36s)]
*  in Russia. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1168.76s)]
*  Sanctioning banks, I know the two heads of the banks that were sanctioned today. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1170.4399999999998s)]
*  They're not going to go in and tell Vladimir Putin, hey, you better stop your war because [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1174.48s)]
*  my bank was sanctioned. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1177.84s)]
*  You know why? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1179.48s)]
*  Because they're the leaders of those banks because Putin put them there. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1180.48s)]
*  I think that's an important thing for people to understand. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1183.68s)]
*  He controls that economy. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1186.2s)]
*  So we were not going to see the consequences of pressure on Putin for, I predict, months, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1188.08s)]
*  if not years to come from these sanctions. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1194.76s)]
*  So it's the right thing to do. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1196.68s)]
*  There has to be a response. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1198.6s)]
*  But let's have no illusions that this is going to change his calculus, at least in the short [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1200.32s)]
*  run. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1204.2s)]
*  On that last point there, there is a sort of common wisdom about sanctions that you [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1205.8s)]
*  don't sanction directly the rogue state leader. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1209.6s)]
*  You don't sanction the dictator personally. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1212.96s)]
*  And you saw the president today sort of fending off and not addressing, not answering questions [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1215.2s)]
*  from a lot of different reporters as to why Putin personally wouldn't be targeted with [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1220.48s)]
*  sanctions. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1224.4s)]
*  The common wisdom for why you don't do that is because once you've sanctioned them, that [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1225.4s)]
*  essentially precludes the possibility of negotiating anything with them, of talking to them about [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1228.3200000000002s)]
*  anything. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1232.72s)]
*  And in this case, however, this is going to be resolved. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1233.72s)]
*  It's going to have to be resolved through some sort of conversation. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1235.88s)]
*  So you need to leave open a door to have a conversation. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1238.0s)]
*  At some point, does that does Putin become a person who doesn't get talked to? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1241.8s)]
*  At some point, does the door to sanctioning him personally become a more important door, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1245.84s)]
*  more important, essentially, tactic to use than keeping over the prospect of talking [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1251.84s)]
*  to him, essentially given what's happened with previous conversations and commitments [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1255.8s)]
*  that he's given up in the past? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1259.3s)]
*  Well, Rachel, you're absolutely right about why our nation, our administration and governments, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1262.72s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans don't like to sanction the head of state because they want to lead [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1267.72s)]
*  open the possibility to me. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1271.5600000000002s)]
*  I respect that. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1274.16s)]
*  I think it's more symbolic than real. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1275.8400000000001s)]
*  But I do think it underscores something else is we've got to start calling. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1277.92s)]
*  You just use the rogue state, pariah state. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1282.88s)]
*  Those are the right terms to talk about Russia today. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1285.1200000000001s)]
*  Tragically, Putin has transformed the state of Russia into those things. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1288.0800000000002s)]
*  And we've got to treat him that way in many different shapes and forms, not just in this [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1293.6000000000001s)]
*  moment, but across the board. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1298.0s)]
*  Isolate him. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1299.84s)]
*  Don't engage him. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1301.04s)]
*  Don't pretend we're business as usual after this war is over. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1302.32s)]
*  And we've got to stand up to evil. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1305.52s)]
*  Let's just let's call it what it is. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1307.7199999999998s)]
*  We've got to stand up. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1309.4399999999998s)]
*  There is right and wrong in the world. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1311.0s)]
*  There is good and evil in the world. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1313.1999999999998s)]
*  My government and my country sometimes has been on the wrong side of those. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1315.1999999999998s)]
*  Let's be honest about that. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1318.4399999999998s)]
*  But in this case, there's right and wrong for those brave Ukrainians that are withstanding [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1319.8799999999999s)]
*  evil. We've got to be with them. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1325.12s)]
*  And by the way, I'm glad you reported it earlier in your program. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1326.88s)]
*  There are also a brave Russians standing up. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1330.04s)]
*  Seventeen hundred were arrested today. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1332.1200000000001s)]
*  Fifty three cities were there. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1334.32s)]
*  Don't underestimate how unpopular this war is. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1336.72s)]
*  They want to hear our voice being as strong. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1340.0s)]
*  They were prepared to be arrested today. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1342.44s)]
*  We need to show that we are going to be as strong and standing up for good versus evil. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1344.44s)]
*  Michael McFaul, the former U.S. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1351.32s)]
*  ambassador to Russia, Professor McFaul, it's always a pleasure to have you. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1352.6000000000001s)]
*  But particularly tonight. Thank you. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1356.76s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks for having me. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNruN8MLZQc&t=1358.8s)]
