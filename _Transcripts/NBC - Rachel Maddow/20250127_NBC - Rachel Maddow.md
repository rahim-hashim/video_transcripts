# Trump spares no expense wasting taxpayer money on deportation plane photo-op stunt
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc)
*  So this is a U.S. military aircraft. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a C-17. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=2.24s)]
*  These are meant to fly not only U.S. troops around the world, but also tons of cargo. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=4.72s)]
*  You can see, if you look inside, just how huge cavernous they are. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=9.56s)]
*  These carry around 85 tons and can still get off the ground. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=14.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Right now, though, the Trump administration is using these same military planes for this, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  for deportations. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=27.52s)]
*  The Trump administration used this C-17 last week to deport 80 people from Texas to Guatemala. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=29.2s)]
*  Unless each of those people weighs more than one ton, it is functionally inexplicable why [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=36.92s)]
*  they needed to be boarded onto a C-17 to make that flight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=44.04s)]
*  Maybe they're very dense. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=49.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=50.56s)]
*  Deportations, of course, take place under every presidential administration. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=52.28s)]
*  Typically, the government hires a plane for the day to do deportations. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=55.6s)]
*  They charter a traditional civilian-style aircraft. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=60.44s)]
*  It costs around $8,000 an hour. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  So take, for example, that flight last week from Texas to Guatemala, about a 12-hour roundtrip [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=66.44s)]
*  flight. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=71.84s)]
*  If you did it the old way, on a normal non-military plane, that would have cost taxpayers a little [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=72.84s)]
*  over $100,000. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=77.48s)]
*  But that, of course, is not how the Trump administration is doing it, because look how [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=78.48s)]
*  look to use these big military planes instead. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=83.56s)]
*  The plane in this picture, this C-17, it is lovely, and it can do a lot of amazing things, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=87.84s)]
*  but it is also wildly expensive compared with normal aircraft. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  Instead of costing roughly $100,000 for that flight, this flight under the Trump administration [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  cost taxpayers more than a quarter million dollars. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=101.68s)]
*  Just that one flight. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=106.08s)]
*  And it's not just the C-17. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  That's actually the cheaper plane they're using. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=109.88s)]
*  The White House says they're also going to use a second kind of military plane to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=112.32s)]
*  carry out deportation, one that's even more expensive. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  A 12-hour roundtrip flight on one of these babies, on a C-130E, that costs taxpayers [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=121.52s)]
*  as much as $850,000. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=127.55999999999999s)]
*  And this is not a one-off thing that they just did for, like, week one to show off how [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  tough they are and look at our great photo op. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=137.56s)]
*  The Trump administration says they plan to use military planes to deport immigrants every [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=139.72s)]
*  single day of the Trump administration. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=146.36s)]
*  So 365 days a year, times four years, times roughly, let's say, $800,000 wasted every [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=149.96s)]
*  single one of those days. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=159.32s)]
*  If you created a bonfire of all that money, it would outshine the sun. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=163.12s)]
*  But that's money that they are lighting on fire for no reason, other than they think [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=168.26s)]
*  it looks cool, looks tough. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=172.89999999999998s)]
*  What kind of respect is this show for the military, by the way? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=175.34s)]
*  The new administration has been trying to make a big splashy deal of all the mass arrests [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=180.54s)]
*  it's been carrying out, very proudly thumping their chest and saying they got 1,200 immigrants [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=184.34s)]
*  arrested in just one day yesterday. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=190.7s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=192.89999999999998s)]
*  They're showing off the fact that they're making good on their promise to prioritize [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=193.89999999999998s)]
*  the deportation of immigrants who have committed serious and violent crimes. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=197.94s)]
*  Except the administration is having to admit today that actually about half of those people [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=202.34s)]
*  they arrested yesterday are not violent criminals at all. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=207.06s)]
*  Half of them are people who have not committed any criminal offense at all, or if they're [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=211.94s)]
*  accused of anything, it's a nonviolent offense. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=216.86s)]
*  But they nevertheless are about to be put on an $800,000 flight out of the country. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=220.98s)]
*  Because doesn't that photo op look awesome? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=226.9s)]
*  Joining us now is Congressman Joe Noguist, Democrat of Colorado, member of the House [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=230.46s)]
*  Democratic leadership team. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=233.42000000000002s)]
*  Sir, it's nice to see you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=234.86s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=236.1s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=237.1s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=238.1s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=239.1s)]
*  Congress has the power of the purse. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  That includes approving the budget for the military. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=241.7s)]
*  What is your feeling about this pledge that they're going to use military planes every [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=244.18s)]
*  day for deportations? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=249.66s)]
*  Well, first, I would just say, Rachel, I think you've articulated well the core strategy [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=251.14000000000001s)]
*  apparently of the Trump administration over the last week, which is to flood the zone [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=256.46s)]
*  with destructive and chaotic decisions accompanied by bluster and photo ops, whether it's in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=260.58s)]
*  reference to the planes or the inauguration rally in which the president signed a number [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=267.41999999999996s)]
*  of destructive executive orders to obfuscate away from the real damage that's caused by [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=272.5s)]
*  the decisions that he and his administration are making. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=277.38s)]
*  And that, of course, extends in the immigration context to his unconstitutional attempt to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=280.06s)]
*  effectively rewrite the 14th Amendment to the pardons that you've covered extensively [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=284.86s)]
*  that he issued to violent felons who assaulted police officers on January 6th. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=289.46s)]
*  And all of these decisions writ large, of course, are striking a lot of fear in communities [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  across the country, including in communities that I represent here in Colorado. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=300.46s)]
*  So, of course, it is beyond the irony of ironies that the waste of taxpayer dollars that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=304.94s)]
*  you described would only be revealed by virtue of your reporting since there is no inspector [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=311.14000000000004s)]
*  general as a result of his midnight purge of the inspector generals just a few days ago. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=316.42s)]
*  So it's important for us to continue to stay alert and to raise these issues to a broader [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=322.70000000000005s)]
*  section of the American public. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=329.06s)]
*  As I mentioned, you're in Democratic leadership in Congress, and I think you're getting at it a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=332.02000000000004s)]
*  little bit here in that in what you just said. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=337.38s)]
*  But can you share a little bit about how Democrats, especially Democrats in leadership [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=339.94s)]
*  right now, are thinking in terms of strategy and potential action around immigration and the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=345.82s)]
*  new administration? I mean, obviously, they've got some highlight things they are trying to do. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=350.62s)]
*  They are trying to bring us back, if not to the 1960s, particularly potentially to the 1860s [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=354.74s)]
*  in terms of what they're doing on on civil rights and discrimination. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=361.54s)]
*  We're seeing what they're doing in terms of trying to use law enforcement to terrorize and punish [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=365.66s)]
*  people who either criticize or in some ways are defined as in opposition to the president and his [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=372.14000000000004s)]
*  administration. They're taking away all forms of accountability and oversight, as you mentioned with [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=380.62s)]
*  the attorneys general, with the inspectors general, excuse me. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=386.62s)]
*  But what they're doing to immigrants is something they say they're going to do every day. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=389.98s)]
*  And they're already getting rid of the idea that it's just going to be criminals, violent [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=393.26s)]
*  criminals. They're already admitting that they're arresting people who don't have any serious [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=398.38s)]
*  criminal charges against them. What's Democratic strategy for trying to take that on? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=403.26s)]
*  A couple of things I'd say, Rachel. First, I certainly agree with you. I think the fears [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=409.34s)]
*  will only metastasize given the current course that this administration is on. I think most [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=412.3s)]
*  Americans agree that our immigration system is broken and that it merits working together in a [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=416.78s)]
*  bipartisan way to protect dreamers, to address immigration in a comprehensive, holistic way. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=421.74s)]
*  That is certainly not this approach that the administration is taking. And I know, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=427.1s)]
*  I suspect, a lot of your viewers, certainly a lot of American citizens, feel helpless and powerless [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=432.14000000000004s)]
*  in this moment given the events of the last seven days. I would encourage folks to resist that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=437.82000000000005s)]
*  temptation. We are not powerless. We each have agency. Every member of Congress, every senator, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=442.14000000000004s)]
*  every citizen has a voice, and now is the time to use it. I would remind your viewers, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=447.58s)]
*  eight years ago, as you covered extensively, Rachel, during President Trump's first term, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=452.94s)]
*  he made a cornerstone priority of his administration, the repeal of the Affordable [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=457.41999999999996s)]
*  Care Act. And as you know, that ultimately did not come to fruition, notwithstanding Republican [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=461.58s)]
*  majorities in the House and the Senate. And that's because the American public stood up and spoke [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=466.29999999999995s)]
*  loudly in opposition to the disastrous plans that he had articulated. I believe that the same will [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=471.58s)]
*  be required in this moment. As you know, the Republicans have a dwindling majority that is [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=477.34s)]
*  shrinking by the day in the House, and we will certainly stand principled, consistent with our [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=482.78s)]
*  values against any efforts that the Trump administration is pursuing that I believe [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=488.61999999999995s)]
*  would undermine the rule of law or, as I said, strike palpable fear in the hearts of so many [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=492.78s)]
*  of our constituents. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghoQ0CJVsqc&t=497.73999999999995s)]
