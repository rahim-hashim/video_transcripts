# Violent, Terroristic Racists Are A Recurrent Problem With No Simple Solution
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE)
*  This is what you might call an ongoing problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, pick your decade. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=4.16s)]
*  Pick your state. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Pick your degree of notoriety or obscurity. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=7.72s)]
*  It's the same thing over and over and over again from the far right in the United States. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  And it swings back and forth from terroristic violence and murder to electoral politics [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=15.84s)]
*  to fantasies about racial purity to conspiracies about the Jews to disgust for democracy and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=22.32s)]
*  a desire, sometimes an effort, to take and hold power by force, by force of arms, instead [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=29.24s)]
*  of through our democratic force of government. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=34.8s)]
*  It keeps coming up. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  This is a recurring thing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=39.12s)]
*  A justification and a call for violence based on this insane, paranoic fantasy that white [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=40.92s)]
*  people are an endangered species as long as there are non-white people around. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=47.4s)]
*  And any change in the ratio of white people to other people is a sure sign that the global [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  to eliminate the white race is approaching its goal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=56.44s)]
*  And so white people need to buy guns and stand up and take our country back and make it great [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=59.68s)]
*  again because otherwise white people are being replaced. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=64.64s)]
*  And this weekend it was 10 people killed in Buffalo, almost all of them elderly African [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=71.18s)]
*  Americans. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=76.0s)]
*  And the shooter decorated his gun with the N-word and the 14-word slogan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=77.36s)]
*  And he posted his online manifesto about how white people are so endangered, how they're [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=83.12s)]
*  being replaced. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=87.28s)]
*  And in August 2019, it was the shooting that killed 23 people, mostly Latinos, at a Walmart [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=90.2s)]
*  in El Paso, Texas. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=95.76s)]
*  And in that case, that guy, too, posted his online manifesto about how white people are [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  so endangered and how they're being replaced. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=101.76s)]
*  And before that, it was April 2019. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=104.64s)]
*  It was the killing in the synagogue in Poway, California, where the killer also posted his [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=106.4s)]
*  online manifesto about how white people are so endangered, how they're being replaced. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=111.32s)]
*  And before that, it was March 2019. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=116.16s)]
*  It was the guy in Christchurch, New Zealand, who killed 51 people in two different mosques. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  And he posted his online manifesto about how white people are so endangered and how they're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=123.0s)]
*  being replaced. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  And before that, it was October 2018. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=128.4s)]
*  It was 11 people killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  shooter there posting all over right-wing social media sites about how white people [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=135.28s)]
*  are so endangered, about how they're being replaced. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=139.32s)]
*  And before that, it was August 2017. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=142.0s)]
*  Those very fine people the former president talked about marching with tiki torches at [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=144.36s)]
*  Charlottesville, Virginia, a show of force, a white male phalanx, shouting to the cameras [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=148.6s)]
*  as they marched about how white people are so endangered, how white people are being [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=153.48s)]
*  replaced. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=157.76s)]
*  You will not replace us. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=160.08s)]
*  Jews will not replace us. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=161.36s)]
*  It is not a new concept. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=165.4s)]
*  It's not even a new pretext, a new justification for violent racist terrorism. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  It has long been so. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=174.88s)]
*  It is right now being newly popularized, newly mainstreamed by the biggest names in conservative [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  media and even by the leadership of the Republican Party in Congress. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=182.2s)]
*  But it is an old idea. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=187.16s)]
*  It is an old and stupid idea. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=189.16s)]
*  It is an old and stupid and dangerous idea, old, stupid and dangerous and equal measure. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  But now what do we do? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=197.68s)]
*  Because there's a reason these white men keep killing black people and Jews and Latinos [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=199.68s)]
*  and Muslims in the largest numbers they can. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  And it is not just because they believe in this ideology and are inspired by it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=208.4s)]
*  They are. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  That's what's leading them to kill all these people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  But beyond that, they keep doing this the way they're doing it, because they're not [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  only adherents of that ideology, they are evangelists for it as well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=222.12s)]
*  They want to spread this ideology to others. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=226.88s)]
*  They want to make it famous. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=229.32s)]
*  They want to make it popular. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  They want more white people to understand this concept and think this way and act like [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=233.64s)]
*  them because of it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=238.72s)]
*  That's why they all post these stupid manifestos online, these explanations of the supposed [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=240.72s)]
*  reasons for their murders. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=246.12s)]
*  So we all have to learn about their asinine, sophomoric, puerile, soft-headed, pitiful [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=248.24s)]
*  little old theories. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=253.32s)]
*  So we all have to take time to learn it, to understand it, to talk about it, so we [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=255.82s)]
*  can explain and understand why all those poor beautiful little old ladies in Buffalo this [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=259.12s)]
*  weekend had to be murdered with an assault rifle while they were doing their grocery [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=267.38s)]
*  shopping. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=270.54s)]
*  I mean, what do you do? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=271.54s)]
*  It doesn't help to pretend we don't know the motive for these repeated, terroristic [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=274.86s)]
*  mass murders. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=282.14s)]
*  They're part of a terrorist movement that is both murderous and seditious and has a [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=284.42s)]
*  very long history in this country, one that is surging anew in terms of its mainstream [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=289.34000000000003s)]
*  influence right now in our media and politics. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=293.82s)]
*  Seeing that movement for what it is, seeing where it's taking hold and who's aiding [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=298.5s)]
*  and abetting it, that's valuable, if only for trying to head off the next inevitable [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=302.18s)]
*  one of these murderous attacks. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=305.82s)]
*  Ignoring why these guys are doing what they're doing and what they're citing as the pretextual [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  justification for their actions. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=312.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it only excuses, for example, the conservative politicians and conservative [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=315.1s)]
*  TV shows that continue to spread this intellectual diarrhea despite the death toll it has already [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=319.66s)]
*  racked up in all of these attacks. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=324.86s)]
*  But it is nauseating, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=328.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it is, to me at least, it is nauseating to be talking about their ideas at all, to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=333.06s)]
*  be talking about the murderous fantasies they all share, that they hope will inspire more [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=339.62s)]
*  killing, more attacks, more terrorism, if only they can just spread the word to enough [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  white people. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=350.09999999999997s)]
*  This is a problem not just about murder and violence, but about information. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=353.21999999999997s)]
*  It is about finding a way to learn what's going on, learning enough to be sharp and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=357.97999999999996s)]
*  real about what's happening online and what's happening in right-wing politics to activate [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=363.09999999999997s)]
*  these kinds of killers, while also in so doing, not helping them spread the word, not helping [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=367.02000000000004s)]
*  them spread these ideas. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=375.38s)]
*  How do we do it right now? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=379.1s)]
*  Today, in the wake of the Buffalo Murders. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=380.66s)]
*  How do we do it every day from here on out? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-D02C61hrE&t=383.70000000000005s)]
