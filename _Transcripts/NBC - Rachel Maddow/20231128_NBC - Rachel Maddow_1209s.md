*  He's 17 and he is from France. He's not Irish. He's come over from France to go to Ireland to work at this restaurant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=0.0s)]
*  he has like an [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=7.8s)]
*  intern job in the kitchen and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=9.5s)]
*  This past week on Thursday on our Thanksgiving Day here [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=13.16s)]
*  This young man 17 years old he was on his way to work. It was about 1 30 in the afternoon and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=16.98s)]
*  He happened upon a man with a knife [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=22.68s)]
*  Who was in the middle of attacking someone? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  The kid jumped into the fray. He was armed with [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=30.36s)]
*  Absolutely nothing at all [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=33.96s)]
*  The kid struggled with this armed man [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=35.96s)]
*  He actually got cut on his hands and his face in the struggle [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  But the kid managed to get the knife out of this guy's hands [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  The restaurant that the kid works at again Spittlefields in Dublin [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=48.96s)]
*  They posted this photo of him online and a testimony to how proud they are of him and what he did [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=52.96s)]
*  They said not all superheroes wear capes [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=57.94s)]
*  The Irish Times also reports that the president of France Emmanuel Macron [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=61.86s)]
*  Placed a call to this young man thanking him personally on behalf of his country thanking him on behalf of France [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=67.02s)]
*  for what he did in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=73.9s)]
*  rushing in to stop that attack while he was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=76.1s)]
*  On his way to work in Dublin in Ireland [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=80.62s)]
*  This man is also not from there he is from Brazil he's from Rio de Janeiro [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=83.61999999999999s)]
*  he's been in Ireland for only about a year he moved to Ireland for work and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=88.34s)]
*  Again on our Thanksgiving Day on Thursday [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=93.94s)]
*  He was also at work in Dublin [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=97.38s)]
*  He was driving a scooter for a food delivery company a company called Deliveroo and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  On his Deliveroo scooter he passed what he thought at first was a fight [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=105.3s)]
*  He slowed down because he thought it was a fight in progress it turned out not to be a fight [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=109.86s)]
*  It was that same man the man with the knife in the middle of what appears to have been a totally unprovoked [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=114.26s)]
*  Knife attack the the Brazilian delivery driver was apparently the first passerby to realize [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=121.06s)]
*  What was happening on the sidewalk that day he stopped his he pulled over stopped his scooter [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=127.54s)]
*  He ran over to the man with the knife he took off the motorbike [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=134.1s)]
*  Helmet that he was wearing and he used his motorcycle helmet to hit the guy [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=137.54s)]
*  He clocked the guy in the head with the motorcycle helmet which knocked the guy down [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=142.57999999999998s)]
*  And then once the guy was down on the ground he hit him once more with the helmet once the man with the knife was down on the ground [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=147.7s)]
*  Thanks to the delivery driver taking off his motorcycle helmet and using it to hit the guy and knock him down [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  That's apparently when other people other passersby were able to get to the guy as well to hold him down frankly [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  To hit him some more but that is also when the 17 year old the french kid from the restaurant [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=164.74s)]
*  Was able to get the knife out of the guy's hand himself getting cut in the process [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=170.34s)]
*  But it was passersby who stopped it the kid from the restaurant and the delivery driver on the scooter playing crucial roles the delivery driver [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=176.1s)]
*  Gave a statement to police after the police arrived on the scene [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=184.82s)]
*  He also gave a statement to a local news organization rte about what happened [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=187.7s)]
*  And then another local guy another local guy from dublin decided to start a go fund me [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=191.3s)]
*  Asking people to show their appreciation by buying the guy a proverbial pint [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=197.94s)]
*  The go fund me said the man's a hero and the least we can do is buy him a pint [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=203.62s)]
*  So i'm asking you to donate the price of a pint of guinness in your local so he knows the people of dublin appreciate him [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=208.66000000000003s)]
*  So again the attack was thanksgiving day it was on thursday the go fund me for the delivery driver was posted on friday [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=215.94s)]
*  By saturday it had raised more than 300 000 euros [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=222.98s)]
*  Because the headline in the new york times donors give over 300 000 euros for immigrant who intervened in dublin stabbing [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  Many people in ireland and beyond are saying thank you [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=234.66s)]
*  As of tonight i just checked before we got on the air more than 30 more than 33 000 people have made donations [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=238.82000000000002s)]
*  And that go fund me to say thank you to the delivery driver on the scooter [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=245.3s)]
*  Now the the knife attack that these two men the brazilian guy and the french guy [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=249.46s)]
*  The knife attack that these two men have done is that they have given donations to the delivery driver on the scooter [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=256.1s)]
*  The knife attack that these two men the brazilian guy and the french guy [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=263.78s)]
*  The knife attack that they intervened in in dublin on thursday was a terrible attack [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=267.7s)]
*  Three little kids were hurt one of them quite seriously also a child care worker who [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=273.78s)]
*  Who stepped in to try to protect the little kids the man who stabbed these people nobody knows why he did it but he was [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=278.26s)]
*  Stopped by these passers-by on the street before the police were able to get there once the police got there he was arrested [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=286.26s)]
*  Almost immediately after this attack right wing social media outlets [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=291.78s)]
*  Including twitter here in the united states and and right wing political groups and locally [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=297.38s)]
*  They started spreading speculation about who the attacker was and why he did it [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=303.38s)]
*  They called for people to come out and riot against immigrants in dublin [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=308.9s)]
*  And people did and they burned a bus they smashed up cars including police cars [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=315.14s)]
*  They looted stores they attacked hostels and hotels where people thought that immigrants were staying [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=320.02000000000004s)]
*  But again, it was a brazilian immigrant delivery driver [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=326.82s)]
*  Who clocked the guy in the head with his helmet and stopped the attack? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  It was this young kid from france who got the knife off the guy once and for all [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=334.42s)]
*  So you get [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=341.62s)]
*  You are here, right? I mean you get the terrible attack [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=343.54s)]
*  Senseless horrific attack [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=347.78s)]
*  You also get hero immigrants stopping it. You also get anti-immigrant riots [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=350.18s)]
*  And then you also get people showing great. Thanks and kindness and generosity [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=355.86s)]
*  To the heroes. It's like a moral tug of war for the soul [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=360.1s)]
*  And honestly the more people who are tugging in the wrong direction on that rope the more people are needed on the other side to pull [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=365.38s)]
*  the other way [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=370.74s)]
*  Hey, so here's some good news that you may not have heard anywhere else good news [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=372.90000000000003s)]
*  In terms of us being a small d democracy [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=378.18s)]
*  So as a general matter [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=382.02s)]
*  One big fundamental threat to democracy and the rule of law is when the justice system when law enforcement [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=384.26s)]
*  Has to bow to the powerful [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  When when prosecutors who investigate powerful people or who bring charges against powerful people find themselves targeted for doing so [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=393.46000000000004s)]
*  When prosecutors learn to expect that if you investigate or indict someone with political power that will likely get you attacked and potentially [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=402.02s)]
*  removed from your job [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=409.2s)]
*  That dynamic is a very dangerous very corrosive thing to the rule of law and therefore to democracy [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=411.86s)]
*  And this past year republicans in the great state of georgia gave themselves the ability to pursue that exact course of action [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=420.9s)]
*  Around the time that the high-profile high-stakes investigation of former president donald trump was starting to bear fruit in the state of georgia [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  The republican-dominated legislature in that state [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=437.46s)]
*  Drafted a new law giving themselves new power giving themselves a new commission [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=440.56s)]
*  That they would populate that they would direct [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=446.97999999999996s)]
*  And that commission would have the power to remove prosecutors in the middle of their terms in office [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=451.94s)]
*  and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=459.29999999999995s)]
*  The legislators who proposed this? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=461.38s)]
*  um [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=463.46s)]
*  Some of them at least were not shy about saying explicitly that the purpose of this [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=464.65999999999997s)]
*  um, or at least their intent once this thing passed [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=469.94s)]
*  Would be to use it to go after falton county district attorney fanny willis [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=474.41999999999996s)]
*  Who has been leading the giant racketeering prosecution against former president trump for allegedly interfering in georgia's elections [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=478.26s)]
*  They've given themselves the power effectively to remove prosecutors and they did so right when a prosecutor [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=486.02s)]
*  Brought charges against donald trump [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=493.38s)]
*  Are they going to try to use it? Well, we might just have gotten an answer [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=495.7s)]
*  To that question very quietly on thanksgiving eve while almost no one was looking [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=500.74s)]
*  A very big deal thing happened in georgia [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=507.62s)]
*  The georgia supreme court ruled on this issue and they said that this law that the republicans passed that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=510.65999999999997s)]
*  Effectively gave them the ability to remove prosecutors [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=517.54s)]
*  The supreme court said that this law cannot work as written [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=521.14s)]
*  the court [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=525.86s)]
*  Fundamentally declined to approve specific rules for how this commission would function in the real world [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=527.6s)]
*  That decision has the practical effect of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=534.9799999999999s)]
*  At least looking like it might kill this effort to oust fanny willis as the falton county prosecutor [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=538.0999999999999s)]
*  Unless georgia republican lawmakers go back to the drawing board and kind of start over with this thing [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=543.38s)]
*  Here's how the atlanta journal constitution described it quote the georgia supreme court said it will not approve rules and regulations [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=549.3s)]
*  For a new state commission empowered to sanction prosecutors effectively rendering moot [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=556.18s)]
*  A law backed by governor brian kemp and other top republicans until lawmakers overhaul the measure [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=561.94s)]
*  Oh, wait, they can still overhaul the measure. Are they going to try to do that? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=569.7800000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is professor clark cunningham. He's professor of law georgia state university is an expert in legal ethics and constitutional law [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=574.34s)]
*  And he is a professor we have called on in the past to help us understand this dynamic [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=580.9000000000001s)]
*  At georgia professor cunningham. I'm really grateful you could be here tonight. Thanks for your time [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=585.7s)]
*  Glad to be with you rachel [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=590.26s)]
*  So the ruling from the supreme court on thanksgiving eve on wednesday effectively said [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=592.74s)]
*  We do not believe that we as the court have the power to establish the rules [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=599.54s)]
*  By which this commission would do this work. Is that a fair layman's way to to summarize what they did? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=604.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that I think that's true. The the law that was passed by the georgia legislature last spring [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=610.9799999999999s)]
*  Provided that the rules that would put the commission into business [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=617.2199999999999s)]
*  Had to be first approved by the georgia supreme court and the georgia supreme court announced on thanksgiving eve that they weren't going to do that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=622.1s)]
*  And therefore the commission cannot proceed at this point [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=629.86s)]
*  in terms of the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=634.1s)]
*  Overall like we sort of where that puts us on the on the on the board game like on the chutes and ladders here [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=636.1s)]
*  How close we are to the end if the ultimate goal of this that I think a lot of observers like me worry about [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=642.42s)]
*  Is that this would give? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=648.66s)]
*  The legislature effectively indirectly, but it would effectively give them the power to remove prosecutors who are doing things they don't like [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=650.8199999999999s)]
*  Does this bring things right back to square run right back to the beginning of the board? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=658.74s)]
*  Or is there an opportunity for the legislature to respond to the court? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=664.42s)]
*  effectively [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=670.24s)]
*  And in short order in a way that would put this back on track [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=672.0200000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, it's not clear what the next steps are going to be [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=677.3800000000001s)]
*  Nothing's going to happen before the end of the year because the georgia legislature is a part-time legislature [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=681.0600000000001s)]
*  And so they won't be back in business for this probably until the new year. They're meeting for redistricting right now [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=686.2600000000001s)]
*  um [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=692.98s)]
*  you know one legislator who was very much a proponent of the bill has [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=693.86s)]
*  Apparently been quoted as saying this is a quick fix that they can get it done in january [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=699.12s)]
*  But this bill has really brought an outlash of criticism from some unexpected places [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=703.9399999999999s)]
*  The both the district attorneys association and what are called the solicitor generals in georgia [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=712.18s)]
*  Both those associations have come out strongly opposed to the bill the national prosecuting attorneys council has come out opposed to the bill [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=717.6999999999999s)]
*  Um, and I don't know that the legislature expected uh prosecutors, um, who are generally I think [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=725.78s)]
*  favorites of of our legislature to be so strongly opposed and there it there are a lot of problems with the bill which was [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=732.9799999999999s)]
*  Placed in a very hasty way not just the the glitch that the supreme court identified [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=740.5799999999999s)]
*  But there are other problems with the bill as well [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=744.9799999999999s)]
*  And I think it's quite possible [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=747.3s)]
*  That it might be the legislature will abandon this project [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=749.3s)]
*  Or if not, they'll have to do some significant reworking of the bill so that the commission doesn't have as much [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=752.98s)]
*  Unregulated power as it seems to have under the bill that was passed last year [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=760.0s)]
*  this past year in terms of public interest and public pressure and how the legislature might [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=764.74s)]
*  Um sort of assess its own appetite for going back and trying to do this again reopening this [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=770.18s)]
*  Against the kind of elite pressure that you were describing there [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=775.54s)]
*  Um, I I was recently in atlanta for uh, just to stop on my on my book tour [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=779.2199999999999s)]
*  I was talking about a totally different matter and this came up [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=783.78s)]
*  In conversation during the event and there was kind of a roar from the audience [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=786.66s)]
*  um where I was surprised that people um, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=790.74s)]
*  Uh were felt very connected to this issue seemed very worried about it [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=794.66s)]
*  I was asked about it a number of times when I was in georgia [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=797.9399999999999s)]
*  Now that may be a self-selecting sample of people who've heard me talk about it on television [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=800.66s)]
*  But is it is it your sense that this is something that the press is following that the public is following that people know [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=805.06s)]
*  um [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=810.34s)]
*  About the the potential seriousness of of what this could mean. Um, if this was allowed to go into effect [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=811.54s)]
*  Given what the legislation would have to do to get there. Well and uh, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=818.82s)]
*  Republican leaders particularly in the state said it really I think overplayed their hand [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=822.88s)]
*  Because within a couple of days after the effective date of the law [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=827.7s)]
*  They filed this uh, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=831.7s)]
*  Pretty [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=834.1s)]
*  pretty venal [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=835.22s)]
*  Complaint against the district attorney fanny willis to try to get the commission to remove her from office [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=836.4200000000001s)]
*  And unfortunately, I think it did themselves and and the law a real damage in terms of credibility because [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=842.1800000000001s)]
*  The complaint they filed was was quite obviously political [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=848.98s)]
*  It didn't have much merit to it [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=853.0600000000001s)]
*  And so I think that was an immediate signal to people that in fact the bill could be abused and that's what [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=855.1400000000001s)]
*  The prosecutor attorney's association here in georgia had been warning about that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=861.22s)]
*  It could be misused for political purposes and sure enough within a couple of days the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=865.0600000000001s)]
*  the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=870.34s)]
*  Republicans in the state senate the lead the majority leader, uh, I guess prove them to be right [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=871.7s)]
*  Professor clark cunningham law professor at georgia state university expert in legal ethics and constitutional law [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=879.0600000000001s)]
*  I know that we bug you about this [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=885.3s)]
*  This this bill this law [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=888.0999999999999s)]
*  This commission all the time to help us stay abreast on it. We really appreciate [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=890.42s)]
*  Well, I compliment you guys for staying on top of this issue. It's an important one [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=894.74s)]
*  Well, it's I think it's important too and I realize that um, we're it's not exactly a huge media scrum [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=899.3s)]
*  That's following this issue, but I think this is an absolutely crucial ethical issue [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=904.66s)]
*  And you've helped us more than anybody in understanding it. Thank you so much. It's great to have you here [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=909.06s)]
*  Good evening again this situation in in georgia [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=913.4599999999999s)]
*  you know one of the things that's being adjudicated in [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=917.54s)]
*  several of the trump civil and criminal cases is the question of whether or not former president trump is allowed to impugn [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=920.66s)]
*  Um or attack or talk about people involved in the court system the prosecutors [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=929.06s)]
*  Other people that are involved in essentially adjudicating these cases georgia is the one place where the legislature the republican [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=934.74s)]
*  Dominators legislature gave themselves the power to not just criticize but remove the prosecutor essentially for any reason [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=942.18s)]
*  They wanted they did that while this case was pending against trump [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=950.18s)]
*  the law [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=955.06s)]
*  Passed became went into effect. It has been stopped essentially with this glitch at the supreme court right now [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=956.66s)]
*  What professor cunningham was just describing in terms of the pressure that the legislature may feel as to whether or not that kind of action [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=962.8199999999999s)]
*  Is proper is okay whether there might be too much [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=968.42s)]
*  Push back to it [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=971.3s)]
*  Is a snapshot of what it takes to hold on to a democracy. I mean [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=973.22s)]
*  Bad actors trying anti-democratic things try all sorts of stuff [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=977.0600000000001s)]
*  Usually what they're doing is testing to see with how much testing to see how much they can get away with [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=981.14s)]
*  And then it's the project of everybody else who's trying to uphold the democracy to give them very clear feedback on what they can't get away with [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=986.26s)]
*  It's happening right now in georgia [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=993.78s)]
*  Just before the thanksgiving break [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=996.9s)]
*  We got the worrying but also totally inevitable feeling news about [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=999.14s)]
*  Republican officials in three different counties in georgia [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1005.04s)]
*  Deciding that they would refuse to certify this year's election results [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1009.86s)]
*  These are republican officials in three different counties who refused to vote to certify [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1014.5799999999999s)]
*  Their county's local election results from earlier this month. These were run-of-the-mill [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1021.22s)]
*  Elections run-of-the-mill election results there was not necessarily anything wrong with these elections or with the results the elections basically went off just fine [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1025.64s)]
*  It's just that they're republican elections officials. And so why would they vote to certify an election result? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1035.96s)]
*  This is just kind of becoming the default republican position now elections are inherently suspect all of them [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1042.6000000000001s)]
*  And you can't count on republican officials to certify those results [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1049.88s)]
*  Not everywhere at least [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1055.16s)]
*  In these three georgia counties these republican officials were outvoted and the results were therefore certified [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1058.52s)]
*  but georgia republicans are pretty clearly telegraphing their intentions for next year when [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1065.64s)]
*  You know amid lots of other important things the presidential race could very easily come down to a closely fought swing state like georgia [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1071.8s)]
*  One county board refusing to certify its election results could throw the whole state and therefore the whole election into chaos [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1078.92s)]
*  so [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1086.6s)]
*  Good times that's ahead. Thanks georgia [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1087.8s)]
*  And simultaneously we've also now got several suburbs north of atlanta [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1091.24s)]
*  That are in fulton county georgia, but they no longer want fulton county to run their elections [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1096.52s)]
*  These conservative leaning suburbs have declared that they don't trust fulton county [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1102.6s)]
*  So they want to run their elections themselves as individual towns. They want to run them the way they did in the horse and buggy days [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1106.6799999999998s)]
*  These towns want fulton county to take their fancy new-fangled voting machines and you know, put them where the sun doesn't shine [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1114.1999999999998s)]
*  These these towns are saying they will hand count all their ballots. Thank you very much with like an abacus and a my pillow [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1120.9199999999998s)]
*  It'll all be so much cheaper. How much could it cost to run an election and hand count thousands of ballots? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1128.36s)]
*  This plan is in part the brainchild of one of georgia's fake republican electors one of the folks who submitted [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1135.24s)]
*  Forged documents claiming that trump had won the state of georgia in 2020 [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1142.28s)]
*  One of the people who's now under investigation by fulton county prosecutors [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1146.6s)]
*  And you will be shocked to learn that earlier this month when they tried this new [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1150.92s)]
*  old-fangled horse and buggy system in one of these towns [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1156.04s)]
*  Voters ended up having less than half the polling places that were usually available to them [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1159.96s)]
*  It took much longer to count the votes and it didn't save any money. It might have even cost more other than that though. It went great [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1164.4399999999998s)]
*  So georgia is rejecting modern voting systems [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1173.3999999999999s)]
*  and also [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1177.48s)]
*  Rejecting totally normal election results out of hand because that's what republicans do now other than that though things looking good [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1178.82s)]
*  So [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1189.32s)]
*  You [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKPUCk_7aC8&t=1209.0s)]
