# DOGE overstepping with raid of independent agency prompts calls for congressional oversight
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo)
*  So, last night, the Doge team, run by President Donald Trump's top campaign donor, staged [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=0.0s)]
*  a hostile physical takeover of an independent nonprofit called the U.S. Institute of Peace. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=7.4s)]
*  The U.S. Institute of Peace is not a government agency. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=14.16s)]
*  Theirs is not a government building. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=16.16s)]
*  They told the Doge staffers they could not come in, that they had no authority over them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=18.68s)]
*  Doge staff then physically forced their way in with the help of the FBI and the D.C. police [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=23.8s)]
*  Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia heard what was happening and went there, along with his wife. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=30.12s)]
*  He later wrote online, quote, I was at the U.S. Institute of Peace tonight to conduct [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=35.32s)]
*  congressional oversight over Doge's break-in. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=39.16s)]
*  USIP is an independent nonprofit entity and I will work to stop Doge's illegal power grab. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=41.8s)]
*  Joining us now is Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=47.72s)]
*  Congressman, I really appreciate you being here to talk about this tonight. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=51.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=53.56s)]
*  Yeah, thank you, Rachel, very much. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  Very concerning. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=56.44s)]
*  And you laid out the case very well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=57.8s)]
*  What did you see last night when you went? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=60.6s)]
*  When we got there, the D.C. police had already escorted all the staff out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=62.92s)]
*  The last person out was the president of the USIP, George Moose, a longtime U.S. ambassador. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=67.16s)]
*  And he had locked himself in his office to protest the illegal firing of 11 of the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=73.32s)]
*  USIP board members by Donald Trump. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=78.6s)]
*  And the D.C. police actually picked the lock on his office [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=81.08s)]
*  to get him and take him to the outside. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=84.52s)]
*  The real challenge is that there's something in the law, the congressional charter for USIP, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=87.48s)]
*  that says a president can replace a board member with board consultation for committing a felony [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=92.28s)]
*  or some gross malfeasance. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=99.96s)]
*  He didn't consult any board members and certainly there were no felonies. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=102.44s)]
*  What do you make of the use of all these various law enforcement agencies [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=107.24s)]
*  as part of these takeovers? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=113.55999999999999s)]
*  We saw this with the U.S. Africa Development Foundation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=114.83999999999999s)]
*  We saw it with some of the very early stuff that DOJ did. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  And we didn't know who they were saying they were going to call on to force their way in. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  But now it seems like they're invoking the U.S. marshals, the FBI, and now the D.C. police, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=127.24s)]
*  as effectively their muscle, as their armed phalanx that will physically force them into places [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=132.84s)]
*  that they may not be legally allowed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=139.72s)]
*  It's very concerning. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=142.36s)]
*  Where does DOJ get any legitimacy, any right to invade an independent nonprofit 501C3? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=145.08s)]
*  Rachel, there are 232,000 501C3 nonprofits in the United States. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  By this measure, Donald Trump could send the police or the marshals into any one of them [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=158.28s)]
*  and demand to see their books, throw out their people, replace their board members. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=163.32s)]
*  It's really unprecedented. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=167.72s)]
*  The poor D.C. police took their orders initially from the acting U.S. attorney, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=169.4s)]
*  this guy Ed Martin, who's just a MAGA hatchet man with a lot of personal vendettas. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=174.28s)]
*  And when they were also called by George Moose and the USIP leadership, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=180.52s)]
*  they didn't know who to trust. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=185.08s)]
*  But I guess they looked at the FBI who said, well, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump fired the board members, therefore you've got to stick with him. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=189.96s)]
*  Although that was clearly illegal. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  The takeover and the shutdown of these agencies is being litigated in all sorts of ways and all [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=194.44s)]
*  sorts of places. I imagine it will be by USIP and U.S. Africa Development Foundation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=201.96s)]
*  That one's already in court and all these other agencies. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=206.52s)]
*  But this issue of what law enforcement is doing, turning up with guns and saying, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=209.16s)]
*  we're taking you out of here physically, we're picking the lock, we're getting you out, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=214.04s)]
*  and we're doing it on behalf of DOJ, that seems like an area for potential litigation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=218.04s)]
*  It also seems like an area for law enforcement oversight, congressional oversight, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=223.48s)]
*  including of the DC police, the FBI, the Marshall Service, and anybody else who they're using in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=228.44s)]
*  this capacity. Do you see any appetite for that among your colleagues on Capitol Hill? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  Oh, very much so. I think our busiest committee on Capitol Hill will be the oversight committee [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=237.0s)]
*  led by my colleague, Jerry Connolly, and Jamie Raskin, AOC, and others will be deeply involved [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=242.12s)]
*  in it. Because we don't have a lot of tools. We're a minority. But we have to use every [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  tool that we have. And the oversight, the ability to investigate and then get the word [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=253.24s)]
*  out to the American people is really, really important. Yeah. And if somebody's calling the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=257.56s)]
*  cops in DC for what is effectively a burglary or an armed assault, they should expect that the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=263.8s)]
*  cops respond to it not on behalf of one political faction or another, but on behalf of a potential [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=269.16s)]
*  victim of crime. Yeah. And I very much hope that in any other place than Washington, DC, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm hoping that the police will be much more independent. In DC, they're going to look first [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=281.56s)]
*  to the U.S. attorney, sadly. And that's the wrong person in this case. Congressman Don Byer, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=285.16s)]
*  Democrat of Virginia. Sir, thank you very much for your time tonight. And thank you for going [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=290.76s)]
*  there last night. Having your eyes on it is a really important part of this. Thank you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=293.88s)]
*  I just wish I'd been able to make a difference. Yeah. Well, you might yet. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=297.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzU4hOjLpo&t=311.56s)]
