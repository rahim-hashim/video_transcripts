Video Description: While a lot of attention is being focused on potential conflicts inherent in Donald Trump (or his superPAC) paying the legal bills of his associates, some of whom are potential witnesses, there may also be a legal question about how that money was raised in the first place and whether people donating to Trump's reelection intended their donation to be used in Trump's legal defense. Tim Heaphy, former lead investigator for the January 6 Committee discusses with Rachel Maddow.

# 'Stop the Steal became a cash machine': Dishonest fundraising could come to bite Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A)
*  Joining us now is Tim Hafe. He's a former lead investigator for the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=0.0s)]
*  congressional investigation into January 6. Mr. Hafe, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for the invitation, Rachel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=7.36s)]
*  So I just wanted to ask you about this hanging thread from the January 6 investigation, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=9.84s)]
*  which does feel like it's got some resonance with what's going on now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  I know the investigation made criminal referrals for Trump, for also John Eastman, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  that you encouraged state bar associations to look further into some of the lawyers involved in this [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=23.76s)]
*  case, including the lawyer who was representing Cassidy Hutchinson. I know he sued the committee [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=28.32s)]
*  for suggesting that he tried to wrongly influence his client. Can you just tell us [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=33.2s)]
*  sort of what became of all that, how that all ended up? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=38.16s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. So you mentioned one thread. There are actually two threads that are significant here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=41.68s)]
*  The first thread is how the money was raised in the first place. So as the select committee [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=47.04s)]
*  showed, Rachel, the Trump campaign very quickly pivoted to a massive fundraising operation, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=52.96s)]
*  essentially peddling election lies. Stop the Steal became a cash machine, and it raised [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=60.08s)]
*  about $250 million between the election and President Biden's inauguration. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=67.04s)]
*  That money, the vast majority of it, went into the Save America PAC, which we then saw over the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=73.12s)]
*  course of our investigation as the entity that was paying the fees of witnesses before the select [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=78.8s)]
*  committee. The people that gave money to this in this effort were told that it was going to the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=85.12s)]
*  election defense fund, that it was going to sort of fuel and pay for litigation or other efforts to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=90.72s)]
*  reverse the result of the election. It did not go to any such thing. There was no election defense [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=97.84s)]
*  fund. Instead, it went to Save America PAC. So the first thread here is essentially the lies and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=104.4s)]
*  the grift that the Trump folks perpetuated to get the money. And then the second thread is the one [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=108.56s)]
*  that you mentioned, and that is that money then goes to pay the legal fees of more than a dozen [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=113.92s)]
*  witnesses, not just Cassidy Hutchinson, but others. A lot of those witnesses did not remember very [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=119.92s)]
*  salient things, very important conversations that others said they were present for. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=127.76s)]
*  Only Cassidy really suggested directly that she was coached to lie. She indicated that her first [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=133.44s)]
*  Trump-funded lawyer essentially encouraged her to hold information back and said, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=140.96s)]
*  you don't need to tell them about that. They don't know what you don't know. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  But we had the suspicion, and we articulate this in our report, that a lot of the Trump-funded [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  lawyers essentially were coaching witnesses to obscure key facts. So it seems to be a pattern, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=154.24s)]
*  and it is one that definitely impacted our investigation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zIO3SBW09A&t=160.56s)]
