# 'Trump is trying to make an example out of me': Stormy Daniels menaced by MAGAs for telling truth
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI)
*  When you say you paid to come up here, you paid your own expenses to come testify. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Multiple times. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  I wasn't compensated or written a check or anything like that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  I got nothing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=11.24s)]
*  And this has cost me so much money. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=12.24s)]
*  I wasn't paid by anybody. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=15.24s)]
*  We're back to my interview with Stormy Daniels. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=17.92s)]
*  I want to let you know that Ms. Daniels was not paid for this interview. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=19.96s)]
*  We do not do that under any circumstances. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=23.48s)]
*  We also came to learn over the course of preparing for this interview and reporting out the circumstances [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=26.62s)]
*  into which we were going to be discussing these matters with her. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=31.5s)]
*  We came to learn that she is in fairly dire financial circumstances because of her confrontation [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=35.14s)]
*  with Trump, as evidenced by the fact that she recently asked a friend, a man named Dwayne [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=39.900000000000006s)]
*  Crawford, to open an emergency GoFundMe campaign to try to pay the attorney's fees that she [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=45.86s)]
*  has incurred and as she tries to hold onto her house. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=51.6s)]
*  For that part of it, I'm going to let Ms. Daniels here explain. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=57.28s)]
*  So the case that in which you just testified was a criminal case brought by prosecutors, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  you were subpoenaed to be there just as a witness. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=68.44s)]
*  The reason that you owe Trump money is a separate matter. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=70.92s)]
*  Your former lawyer, Michael Avenatti, who is now in prison for defrauding you and other [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=75.16s)]
*  brought a defamation suit against Trump by you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=80.12s)]
*  That case was thrown out and Trump was awarded attorney's fees. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=82.96s)]
*  And that totals, to make a long story short, it totals at about $600,000 that you need [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=87.92s)]
*  to pay Trump. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=93.0s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=94.0s)]
*  And I was never allowed to give testimony. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=95.0s)]
*  They never saw my evidence. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  It was never ruled whether I was telling the truth or not. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=100.28s)]
*  So for all those people that are out there saying you lost a defamation case because [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=103.78s)]
*  they found that you to be a liar or untruthful is not true. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=106.48s)]
*  They never even looked at the case. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=110.36s)]
*  Other side of that is Ms. Carol, E. Jean Carol, was called the exact same things by Donald [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=111.9s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  And not only did they accept her case and let her take the stand and let her have her [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  day in court, they've given her millions. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=121.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, my attorney's fees have racked up to over half a million dollars. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  Do you have any means of paying that? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=129.98000000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=132.0s)]
*  And nor do I think I should. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=133.0s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=135.44s)]
*  In terms of what happens next, Judge Brachon just lifted the gag order. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=136.64s)]
*  So he's still prohibited from attacking court staff and prosecutors and their families, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=143.0s)]
*  but he is now free to attack jurors and witnesses, which means you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=147.3s)]
*  When the gag order was in place, did you benefit from that at all? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=155.0s)]
*  Are you worried about it being lifted? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=157.76s)]
*  No. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=159.72s)]
*  I mean, he's going to say what he's going to say anyway. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=160.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=163.92s)]
*  I'm not afraid of what he could say about me or what he could call me. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=165.39999999999998s)]
*  I'm telling the truth. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm the only one that has continued to tell the truth. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  I can prove everything that I've ever said. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=174.92s)]
*  So I'm not concerned about those things he might say. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=178.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=180.92s)]
*  I'm concerned of him saying something that will make his followers come after me more. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=181.92s)]
*  Has that changed over time the character of the way people have come after you, the kind [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=189.11999999999998s)]
*  of language? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=192.76s)]
*  Has that changed over time? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=193.84s)]
*  The biggest thing is that they're not hiding. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=194.84s)]
*  They used to all be bots. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=197.04s)]
*  Now they're using their real stuff. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=199.44s)]
*  There's Facebook threads from people in my own community planning to do things to my [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=200.92s)]
*  house and my family. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  I sent some messages over when Barrett was on another show, and they couldn't even air [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  everything they said, graphic details about how they were going to rape everybody in my [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=219.76s)]
*  family, including my young daughter, before they killed them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=224.04s)]
*  Very graphic things talking about a child. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=227.08s)]
*  And most importantly, Trump is trying to make, I believe, trying to make an example out of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  me of anybody who dares stand up to him. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=235.2s)]
*  And he will, I was served again yesterday, sorry, the day before yesterday, and they [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=239.12s)]
*  were trying to take my partner's house. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  It has nothing to do with me. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=246.36s)]
*  She doesn't even own the house, technically. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=248.68s)]
*  It's got a mortgage. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=249.68s)]
*  The man owns it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=250.68s)]
*  I don't own that house. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=252.12s)]
*  I pay him rent every month because I split some bills with him, but I don't own it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=253.72s)]
*  My name's not on the title. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=257.52s)]
*  I didn't put any money down on this house. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=258.52s)]
*  They're trying to take his house. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=260.52s)]
*  They're demanding personal information about my 13-year-old daughter. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=263.44s)]
*  I refuse to fill out that form. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=268.52s)]
*  Identifying information about her? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=271.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=273.24s)]
*  Where she lives, her legal name, her date of birth. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=274.24s)]
*  Why do you need that about a child? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=277.0s)]
*  So I didn't fill out that part of the form. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  I left it blank. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=280.96s)]
*  And they rejected it and sent it back and are demanding that I be held in contempt with [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=282.35999999999996s)]
*  sanctions and that I have to pay this money. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=287.64s)]
*  I have to pay $600,000 plus sanctions and be in contempt of court, which comes with [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=292.52s)]
*  a warrant, possibly, because- [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  An arrest warrant. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=298.64s)]
*  An arrest warrant. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=299.64s)]
*  Because the things I said, which they found him guilty of, I also have to pay, and I'm [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=301.44s)]
*  protecting my child. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=308.88s)]
*  And you could be the biggest Trump supporter, a woman voting for Trump, love him, ask that [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  woman, you going to vote for Trump? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  Do you love Trump? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  How do you feel about him having your young daughter's legal name, address, and identifying [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  information? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=323.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=325.8s)]
*  And no woman out there, I can imagine, would give that information up. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=326.8s)]
*  They got my address and look how quickly that happens. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=331.32000000000005s)]
*  You think I'm going to give up the other address? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=333.32000000000005s)]
*  Because sometimes she's with me, obviously, and sometimes she's with her father. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  Why would I do that? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=340.08000000000004s)]
*  But that's essentially- So there's basically two impasses now in terms of that money and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=341.08000000000004s)]
*  the resolution of that defamation case and you paying the legal fees. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  One is you don't have the money to pay. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=351.04s)]
*  But two is they want you as part of that to give over that identifying information [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=352.68s)]
*  about your daughter and your refusability. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  And even if I had the money, even if I had billions, it's not fair. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  Why do I have to pay it? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=362.16s)]
*  And I'm so happy for E. Jean Carroll, but literally the same three sentences, like liar, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=363.92s)]
*  whack job, con job, or whatever, she gets over 80 million and it costs me over 600,000. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=369.6s)]
*  It's going to cost my partner his house. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=375.64s)]
*  It's going to cost my daughter her privacy for the rest of her life. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=379.32s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=383.44s)]
*  I feel like, Stormy, the Trump movement has destroyed or tried to destroy a lot of people [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=385.76s)]
*  for posing a threat to Donald Trump or a challenge to him. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=393.36s)]
*  And there are, as you've been describing, millions of Americans, if not tens of millions [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  of Americans who have a rooting interest in all of these various efforts to confront him [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=402.16s)]
*  and expose his behavior and hold him accountable for crimes or treachery or whatever. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=407.04s)]
*  But the rooting interest doesn't help you, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=411.84s)]
*  Well, more than half the country is rooting for him being held accountable. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=414.52s)]
*  The people who are actually in the middle of these confrontations are being terrorized [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=420.92s)]
*  and menaced and ruined. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=424.56s)]
*  And overall, this system, I'm sorry to sort of put this to you, but I feel like the system [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=427.92s)]
*  is unsustainable unless the real live human people who are willing to stand up and be [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=434.8s)]
*  counted and speak the truth against him are themselves protected. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=439.2s)]
*  You could be me. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=444.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=445.0s)]
*  We could all be me, like anybody out there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=446.0s)]
*  They're trying to seize property of people that I care about that's not even mine to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=449.48s)]
*  scare me. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=454.56s)]
*  They're trying to ruin my daughter's life before she even has a chance to live it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=456.0s)]
*  And they're trying to financially ruin me and take money. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=461.04s)]
*  Because I told the truth. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=464.76s)]
*  And I shouldn't have to do that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  And I've never asked for help before. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=468.36s)]
*  I've been fighting this by myself. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=469.96s)]
*  You know, even the people closest to me, my best friends, my partners, everyone else can [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=472.48s)]
*  take a break. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=479.32s)]
*  You know, my best friend, Dwayne, has been my tour manager, my assistant. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=480.32s)]
*  He's lived it the most with me. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=484.44s)]
*  But even he gets to take breaks. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  He gets to get on a plane and go home and take his kids and his family to Disneyland [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=487.68s)]
*  and not think about it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=491.92s)]
*  I am the only person that every single day for the last six years, this has bled into [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=493.6s)]
*  my life. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  Some days worse than others. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=501.48s)]
*  Some days I'm picking pellets out of my horse's body and getting served papers and sobbing [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=502.94s)]
*  because they're trying to, you know, that I miss because I miss my daughter. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=508.48s)]
*  And she's not safe if she's with me sometimes. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=513.24s)]
*  And some days it's just things I read on the Internet. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=516.16s)]
*  But every single day, even you, I mean, you live this. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=519.28s)]
*  You tell the story, even you, Rachel, like there has to be moments where you've gotten [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=522.2s)]
*  to check out, at least for a minute. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=527.2800000000001s)]
*  I've never had a day like that in over six years. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=528.2800000000001s)]
*  Your work life has been severely curtailed by this. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  Changed. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=534.9200000000001s)]
*  You're still you've still got some stuff going. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=535.9200000000001s)]
*  You've been doing comedy events. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=537.76s)]
*  I just came back to that last week. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=539.32s)]
*  But same thing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=540.96s)]
*  The owner of the club got death threats. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=542.62s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=544.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm from New Orleans. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=545.48s)]
*  It's New Orleans. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=546.48s)]
*  She didn't care. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=547.48s)]
*  How many places are out there that I don't know about that are afraid to book me? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=549.16s)]
*  How are you going to make enough money to live? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=552.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=555.08s)]
*  I'm not like it's literally like between legal fees and not being able to work, especially [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=556.08s)]
*  because I wasn't working during. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=560.52s)]
*  Remember, the trial got pushed. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=562.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=564.24s)]
*  So I had taken off a bunch of time before and then it got extended. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=565.24s)]
*  So there were several months where I didn't do anything. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=569.24s)]
*  I just stopped doing my podcast because they were freaking out about everything I said. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=571.0s)]
*  I didn't even get to tell the podcast company why I stopped talking to them because I didn't [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=575.28s)]
*  want anything I used to be internet and just create more work for the prosecution, basically. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=580.24s)]
*  Or I didn't want to be taken off the witness list for all the reasons I told you earlier. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=585.92s)]
*  You know, there's so many things. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=590.16s)]
*  People being just afraid to hire me. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=593.12s)]
*  Luckily, I do have some really great people. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=594.4s)]
*  You know, I hosted the TV show and out TV and I'm starting to go back and do some standup [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=596.28s)]
*  comedy and things like that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=602.4s)]
*  But. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=605.4s)]
*  I've lost a lot more than I've made. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=607.52s)]
*  Mostly my piece, mostly my daughter's privacy and time, time I'll never get back with her. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=610.28s)]
*  Given that, are you worried about Trump potentially being elected to a second term? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=616.8s)]
*  Shouldn't we all be worried about that? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=622.16s)]
*  Are you worried about it particularly for you? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=623.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=626.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=627.8s)]
*  Because I think that he will make, try to make even more of an example out of me. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=629.32s)]
*  You know. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=635.84s)]
*  And also because people, his followers will probably be more, even more bold thinking [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  if they do something, he'll pardon them. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=644.84s)]
*  In terms of his own criminal liability, he's due to be sentenced very soon. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=649.2s)]
*  You said shortly after the verdict that you thought he should be sentenced to jail and [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=653.24s)]
*  community service working for the less fortunate or quote being the volunteer punching bag [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=657.76s)]
*  at a women's shelter. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=663.04s)]
*  Do you still feel that way? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=665.04s)]
*  You still think that? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=666.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, money is no object to him. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=667.04s)]
*  For somebody else, you know, take, finding them a bunch of money could definitely teach [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=669.96s)]
*  them a lesson. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=674.36s)]
*  In his case, his supporters just go throw it at him. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=675.36s)]
*  And we're talking about a man who got convicted of 34, you know, and they, in one night, how [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=677.16s)]
*  much was it? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  Like a hundred million dollars or something was given to him when he was found guilty. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=684.4399999999999s)]
*  Which I can be found guilty. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=688.64s)]
*  You know, like it's, finding him is not going to do any good. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=690.64s)]
*  I think, you know, taking away his control, which is freedom, by a jail sentence, if that's [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=695.36s)]
*  what fits it, would teach him the most because he's so used to being in control. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=704.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=708.84s)]
*  It's not about locking him out and taking away his freedom, it's about taking away his [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=709.84s)]
*  control would be more helpful in this case, I think. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=711.84s)]
*  And making him do some community service, especially with those people that he looks [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=716.96s)]
*  down upon so much. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD4zq85EtGI&t=723.52s)]
