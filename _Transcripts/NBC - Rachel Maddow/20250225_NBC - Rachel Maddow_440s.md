Video Description: Elon Musk's DOGE team removed key items from its "wall of receipts" after journalists fact-checked their boasts of billions in savings from cuts to federal programs and exposed sloppy errors and outright falsehoods. Rachel Maddow reports on the walk back taking place shortly after a withering rebuke from a federal judge for not complying with an order to allow funding to continue, all amid the embarrassment of having to un-fire federal workers recklessly let go without consideration for the necessity of their role.

# Busted: DOGE humiliated by brutal fact-checking, walks back bogus savings claims
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8)
*  Federal District Court Judge Amir Ali in Washington today telling the Trump administration, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=0.0s)]
*  you shut down foreign aid funds, and it appears at first glance that you were not legally [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=4.96s)]
*  allowed to do that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=11.08s)]
*  I ordered you to immediately restart those funds, and you have not done so. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=13.24s)]
*  You now have until tomorrow to do it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=18.68s)]
*  And if you can't do it, or you have some excuse that makes you think you still ought [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=20.96s)]
*  not do it, I want the relevant officials in my courtroom and under oath telling me why [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=26.88s)]
*  they are not doing it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=33.48s)]
*  The motion to enforce is granted. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=38.96s)]
*  Get those funds out the door by midnight tomorrow night. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=40.96s)]
*  This nonsense is over. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=45.2s)]
*  Just a humiliation for the Trump administration in court today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=49.08s)]
*  Not only not doing what they are legally required to do, but unable to even spit out a complete [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=53.24s)]
*  sentence justifying why they're not complying with the court's order. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=60.72s)]
*  Just a legal disaster and a humiliation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  And that court recessed after the judge gave his order at 1.09 p.m. today, and exactly [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  10 minutes later at 1.19 p.m. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=77.48s)]
*  10 minutes after that legal humiliation today, this New York Times headline posted, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=80.56s)]
*  Doge quietly deletes the five biggest spending cuts it celebrated last week. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=87.04s)]
*  So while we're on the theme of the Trump administration being humiliated, I mean, literally within [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=93.84s)]
*  10 minutes of a federal judge ordering President Trump and his top campaign donor, Elon Musk, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=98.04s)]
*  to undo the biggest thing they have yet done to the United States government, their shutdown [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=104.12s)]
*  of all foreign aid. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=109.0s)]
*  Ten minutes after that court order to fix that by tomorrow or be prepared to be in my [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=110.0s)]
*  courtroom testifying under oath as to why you are breaking this lawful order. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=115.68s)]
*  Ten minutes within 10 minutes of that, the New York Times post this story on how the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=121.8s)]
*  five largest other things they claim to have done to the U.S. government aren't real. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=125.64s)]
*  And so they've had to take them down off their website and stop claiming that they did them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=131.6s)]
*  Last week, Elon Musk's government cost slashing initiative, which he calls the Department [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=136.6s)]
*  of Government Efficiency, posted an online wall of receipts celebrating how much it had [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=141.96s)]
*  saved by canceling federal contracts. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=148.52s)]
*  Now the organization has deleted all of the five biggest quote savings on that original [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=151.24s)]
*  list after the New York Times and other media outlets pointed out that those lists were [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=158.4s)]
*  riddled with errors. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=162.76s)]
*  Quote, the last of the original top five disappeared from the site in the early hours of Tuesday. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=164.2s)]
*  The website offered no explanation for why it had removed some items. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=170.04s)]
*  But these were the original five largest savings on its list. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  First, an $8 billion cut at ICE, at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  The actual contract in question was worth not $8 billion, but $8 million. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=185.73999999999998s)]
*  Next, three $655 million cuts at USAID. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=191.48000000000002s)]
*  Quote, this was actually a single cut that was erroneously counted three times. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=198.88s)]
*  In addition to not being $655 million three times, it's now only listed once and instead [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=204.72s)]
*  of being listed at $655 million, it's listed at $18 million. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=211.16000000000003s)]
*  So they were off there by hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=216.24s)]
*  But wait, there's one more, a $232 million cut at the Social Security Administration, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=221.88s)]
*  which appears actually, according to reporting from The Intercept, to be a project that is [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=227.88s)]
*  not worth $232 million. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=232.52s)]
*  It is worth $560,000. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=235.24s)]
*  So we're only off by, how big is the window on your calculator? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=240.4s)]
*  And doesn't need batteries. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=248.16s)]
*  So they're not sending their best. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=250.76s)]
*  I mean, to the extent that we are supposed to think of the authoritarian overthrow of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=251.96s)]
*  the US system of government as some sort of benevolent mission, because these are math [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=256.12s)]
*  geniuses who are doing it, right? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=261.92s)]
*  To the extent that that's why we're supposed to like the dismantling of the US government, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=264.68s)]
*  because they're so good at math and so therefore this must be good for us. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=269.92s)]
*  Yeah, it turns out their math doesn't work. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=272.92s)]
*  And even though they are having to rescind by court order the things they are most proud [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=276.12s)]
*  of doing, the biggest things they're trying to do, or they're having to rescind from [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=285.12s)]
*  their wall of receipts everything they previously said about all their other best and biggest [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  moves, even though all of this stuff is getting wound back, literally all of the biggest things [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=293.88s)]
*  they said they have done are now getting undone or they never happened in the first [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=299.52s)]
*  place. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=303.24s)]
*  Even still though, it's not like they're getting better or more humble or more accurate [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=304.24s)]
*  over time. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=310.64s)]
*  Back to that New York Times article today, quote, some of the new canceled contracts [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=311.64s)]
*  Doge added to its website this week appear to make some of the same types of errors. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=317.4s)]
*  The largest savings on the latest version of its list is a $1.9 billion cut at the Treasury [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=322.64s)]
*  Department. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  But as reported in the Times last week, that contract was actually canceled last fall when [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden was president and when Doge did not yet exist. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=334.4s)]
*  So that $1.9 billion isn't anything they did either. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  Even the stuff they say is their best, their biggest successes, their greatest hits has [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=344.2s)]
*  all fallen apart under the most cursory scrutiny. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, what have they done? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=356.88s)]
*  They have fired a lot of people. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=359.88s)]
*  And then they've had to unfire a lot of them when they realized that they actually had [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=362.24s)]
*  no idea who they were firing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=366.16s)]
*  We had the oops firings of workers at the National Nuclear Security Administration. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=368.2s)]
*  Oops, wrong people to fire. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=373.6s)]
*  Those had to be rescinded. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  Oops, had to hire those people back. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  We had the oops firings of the people who work on bird flu. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=379.68s)]
*  Oops, wrong people to fire. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=382.84000000000003s)]
*  Those people have to be unfired and brought back. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=384.44s)]
*  Now news that they're trying to unfire the people who work in really simple, really easy [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=387.0s)]
*  to replicate low productivity fields like overseeing the safety of the robots that do [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=392.04s)]
*  surgeries on humans. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=398.2s)]
*  And the people who work on the safety of pacemakers and implanted defibrillators. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=401.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's a waste of time. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=406.72s)]
*  That's a waste of money. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=409.56s)]
*  Who needs those things to be safe? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=410.56s)]
*  Fire those people. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=412.44s)]
*  Trying to unfire those people now. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kegqLSZi7o8&t=415.71999999999997s)]
