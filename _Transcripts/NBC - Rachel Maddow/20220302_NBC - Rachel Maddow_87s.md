# Oath Keeper Pleads Guilty To Seditious Conspiracy; Agrees To Cooperate
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM)
*  I want to ask you about another piece of the January 6 news tonight, because there's a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=0.0s)]
*  member of the far-right Oath Keepers militia who has just pled guilty to seditious conspiracy [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=3.44s)]
*  in the attack on the Capitol, which in of itself is pretty significant. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=9.56s)]
*  What does that mean, and how big of a deal is it? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  It's a very big deal, Eamon. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  I think, you know, seditious conspiracy is a charge that is used rarely, because it requires [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  not only a use of force to interfere with government authority, but it requires that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  it is the authority of the United States. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  And so what they argued there in that case, the allegation was that they were using force [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=36.28s)]
*  We now have a defendant in that group of Oath Keepers, 11, who says, yes, I did do this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=39.48s)]
*  And also importantly, he is cooperating. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=44.16s)]
*  And this particular defendant also was with Roger Stone on January 6th, earlier that day. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=47.12s)]
*  So his cooperation promises to be potentially very fruitful. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=52.16s)]
*  Yeah, incredible. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=56.0s)]
*  Two significant developments today from the January 6th committee. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=57.04s)]
*  Barbara McQuade is the former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=59.92s)]
*  Barbara, always a pleasure. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=63.56s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=65.16s)]
*  Greatly appreciate your expertise tonight. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCAs9sGIETM&t=66.16s)]
