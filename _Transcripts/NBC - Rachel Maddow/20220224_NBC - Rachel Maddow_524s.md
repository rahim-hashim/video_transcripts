# What People Are Getting Wrong About How Sanctioning Russia Works
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0)
*  All right, what I'm about to show you here are images from the Russian state run news agency that's called TASS, T-A-S-S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=0.0s)]
*  This guy here in all blue and the black mask, that's the CEO and executive board chairman of Sberbank, S-B-E-R Bank, Sberbank, Russia's biggest bank. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=7.2s)]
*  This guy is the chairman of the board for another major Russian bank, a bank called Alphabank. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=18.32s)]
*  This guy here who is readjusting his mask, he's the CEO of Gazprom, which is Russia's decrepit giant natural gas company. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=23.84s)]
*  The guy in front of him also touching his mask, that's the CEO of the oil producing and refining wing of Gazprom. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=32.08s)]
*  All of these men, we have all these images because they're all part of a weird staged televised meeting that Putin had with Russian business leaders today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  After Russia invaded Ukraine, the value of the Russian ruble plummeted to an all-time low. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=46.72s)]
*  So this big meeting was basically Putin performatively assuring these big heads of Russian businesses and Russian finance and the audience watching on TV that actually, you know, don't believe the hype. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=52.8s)]
*  The Russian economy is going to be fine. He knows what he's doing. Everything's going to be OK. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=64.96s)]
*  But then a few hours after that meeting, President Biden got on TV here in the United States and he unveiled the latest round of Russian sanctions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=69.92s)]
*  These are the largest and most severe sanctions yet. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=78.64s)]
*  That televised meeting that had just happened in Moscow took on a new significance after President Biden's announcement because now we can consult the footage from that televised meeting in Moscow as kind of a visual record, a who's who of the new U.S. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=82.48s)]
*  sanctions list because all those dudes at that Putin meeting today turned out to get sanctioned later this afternoon. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  All those people I just mentioned, all of their companies were all sanctioned. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=104.08s)]
*  The U.S. sanctioned Russia's two largest financial institutions, a dozen other major Russian financial institutions and elites close to President Putin. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=107.92s)]
*  The U.S. set new restrictions on what technology can be exported to Russia. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=115.92s)]
*  These sanctions were all coordinated with other sanctions from the G7 group, which is us, the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the whole EU. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=119.92s)]
*  While a lot is happening, there is still more that could be happening. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=130.32s)]
*  The U.S. hypothetically could lobby for Russia to be cut out of the big banking system that's called Swift, which is essentially a system by which all banks around the world communicate and work with one another. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=134.88s)]
*  Russia has been working to create its own sort of parallel system to Swift, but cutting them out of Swift would cut them out of a huge chunk chunk of global trade and finance altogether. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  That's the action that kicking them out of Swift that that happened against Iran in a few years ago. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=158.0s)]
*  I think it was 2012 that happened to Iran. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=164.16s)]
*  We could also hypothetically seize the assets that Russian oligarchs have parked abroad or potentially could sanction President Putin himself. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=167.44s)]
*  Although that has potentially unintended consequences that the United States might not like. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=174.56s)]
*  The bottom line here is that sanctions are the biggest and most direct weapon that the United States and our allies are wielding against what Russia is doing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  Russia certainly has baked some of that into their calculations, expecting sanctions and thinking that they can endure them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  But sanctions exist on a scale. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=194.8s)]
*  If it's sort of zero to 100, where are we on that scale? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=196.8s)]
*  What else could be done and how much of that scale involves actions that we might take which would hurt Russia, but would also hurt us? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=202.16s)]
*  Joining us now is Hagar Chamali. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  She was a senior policy advisor in the Treasury Sanctions Division during the Obama administration. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  She was Treasury spokesperson back when the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 when they took over Crimea. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  She's also the host of Oh My World on YouTube. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=223.44s)]
*  Ms. Chamali, thank you so much for being with us tonight. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=227.12s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=228.88s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=230.4s)]
*  What are people getting wrong? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=232.96s)]
*  What are people like me getting wrong when we are talking about sanctions? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=234.64s)]
*  I know that you are not only a sanctions expert, but you are somebody who is very good at explaining them to those of us who don't understand them well. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=238.96s)]
*  What are some of the common misconceptions and mistakes people are making when we're thinking about this part of what the United States can do? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=245.92s)]
*  Well, I didn't see that you said anything wrong just now in your introduction. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=254.16s)]
*  But when the press conference took place earlier today with President Biden, there were a lot of questions posed by the reporters that made me feel like there was a lack of understanding of how these sanctions were being used in the strategy that the Biden administration is crafting toward this situation and how they work in general. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=257.68s)]
*  Right. So sanctions are not the silver bullet to changing behavior. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=275.36s)]
*  They're not usually relied upon for that, because if that were the case, then we would kind of be disappointed over and over again. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=279.2s)]
*  They're supposed to be part of a broader strategy, and that strategy is what's supposed to change behavior. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=285.68s)]
*  And the Biden administration knows that. Right. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=291.6s)]
*  So that's why arming Ukraine is a big piece of it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=293.36s)]
*  And a lot of military experts, people like Representative Slotkin, who you had earlier on the show, they all have argued that maybe we need to be arming more. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=295.92s)]
*  So diplomatic negotiations are part of it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=303.92s)]
*  Right. Maybe some covert actions that we don't know about or can't talk about. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=305.92s)]
*  So they're not the silver bullet. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=310.16s)]
*  The things that I hear about that are a little concerning right now is not just the emphasis placed on them. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=311.76s)]
*  It's also these types of activities or actions that you just talked about. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=318.08s)]
*  Right. Cutting Russia off from Swift right now so quickly would backfire on us. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=321.92s)]
*  Right. We engage in trade with with Russia. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=328.88s)]
*  So does Europe. Notably, they import 40 percent of their oil and gas from Russia. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=331.6s)]
*  So all of that trade would stop overnight. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=336.56s)]
*  And that would obviously have a huge backlash if you haven't set up other sources of oil and gas. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=339.04s)]
*  It would cause gas prices around the world to skyrocket. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=344.48s)]
*  And when you talk about targeting the head of any state, targeting ahead of state is something that is not taken lightly. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  It is only taken once you've decided once the U.S. government has decided that there are no more opportunities for diplomatic negotiations, that any engagement has stopped and will come to an end. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=354.88s)]
*  And that doesn't work here because diplomatic negotiations may be needed to end this crisis. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=365.44s)]
*  And secondly, there are other issues we talk about with Russia still, like the Iran deal and arms treaties. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=370.56s)]
*  In terms of the swift sanctions that you were talking about, obviously, that's become a lot of a buzzword, I think, for a lot of people who don't necessarily understand the kind of consequences that you were talking about there. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=377.84s)]
*  But the way you just described it, it sounds like. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=387.28s)]
*  Kicking that out of Swift, again, like we did, like happened with Iran in 2012, is something that is theoretically possible, would be hugely consequential and might potentially happen somewhere down the road. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=390.23999999999995s)]
*  But it's not something that you would do instantly. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=401.67999999999995s)]
*  It's not something that you would do without giving essentially the world a chance to adjust so that we aren't we aren't punching ourselves in the face by trying to hit them. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=403.84s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=414.08s)]
*  You know, when when you have an economy like Russia's that's so well integrated into the international financial system, it poses both an opportunity and a challenge. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=415.04s)]
*  So the opportunity is that if they have assets abroad, if they have assets in U.S. dollars, if you know, you have oligarchs who've parked their assets everywhere and invested everywhere, that's an opportunity to hit them hard. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=423.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=434.64s)]
*  The any sanction will not be symbolic. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=435.2s)]
*  It will have a heavy effect. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=437.6s)]
*  But on the flip side, you have this challenge where they are well integrated. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=439.44s)]
*  Many people depend on the trade on trade with Russia. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=442.96s)]
*  Whatever happens with these sanctions or against Russia will affect global markets and not just in oil and gas, but probably in nickel and aluminum and steel, other things that are produced there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=446.0s)]
*  And so these are all things that the Treasury Department has to take into consideration when they're making their analysis on how to craft these sanctions. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=456.08s)]
*  When I was there in 2014, for example, those sanctions were very carefully and surgically calibrated to ensure no backlash this time around. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=465.12s)]
*  The activities worse and President Biden in his speech said there's a price to pay for freedom. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=475.36s)]
*  And that's what he was talking about. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=480.0s)]
*  I got your Molly, former senior policy adviser in the Treasury Sanctions Division. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=482.32s)]
*  You are doing a great service both here tonight and also in social media and all the ways that you're participating in terms of making this real and understandable to the American public who isn't used to this stuff at a technical level. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for helping us understand it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=498.64s)]
*  And please keep doing what you're doing. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=502.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--bfCIYMPu0&t=511.36s)]
