# No known record of Santos mugging, assassination attempt: police sources
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY)
*  I have an update for you on a story we covered a couple of weeks ago about an actual member [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=0.0s)]
*  of Congress who is definitely also an international man of mystery. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=4.92s)]
*  His name is Republican Congressman George Santos and his every utterance about his resume [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  and record is now being scrutinized because almost everything he's ever said about himself [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=13.9s)]
*  is turning out to be a big torquey pie, which is rhyming slang for the man he lies. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=18.32s)]
*  So you might remember last month, a couple of weeks ago, we got this video of an interview [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=25.92s)]
*  Congressman Santos did with a Brazilian podcast called Radio Novello a Presenta. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=29.76s)]
*  And in this podcast interview, the Congressman said that he had been mugged in the middle [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=36.0s)]
*  of Fifth Avenue in New York City in broad daylight and he said the mugger ran off, among other [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=40.900000000000006s)]
*  things, with his shoes, leaving him standing there in the middle of Fifth Avenue in his [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=46.72s)]
*  socks. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=51.92s)]
*  He also said somebody had then tried to kill him. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=53.24s)]
*  Because of that, he said an NYPD police escort had to stand guard at his home because he [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=56.0s)]
*  had been the victim of an attempted murder. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=60.32s)]
*  And you know, who am I to say? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=63.88s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=65.48s)]
*  But think about it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=66.48s)]
*  If you were mugged in the middle of Fifth Avenue, if somebody tried to kill you, you [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=67.48s)]
*  would probably call the police, right? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=71.88s)]
*  I mean, you must have called the police. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=73.56s)]
*  If the result was that a police officer got stationed outside your home, that doesn't [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=76.76s)]
*  just happen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  After we found that interview and those statements by Congressman Santos, we checked to see if [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=82.64s)]
*  he had ever filed a police report about his alleged dramatic Fifth Avenue mugging or about [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=86.24s)]
*  being the victim of an attempted murder. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=91.2s)]
*  Well, now I can tell you, here is what we have found out. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=93.0s)]
*  This information was obtained by our colleagues at WNBC. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=96.56s)]
*  It's being reported here exclusively. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=99.42s)]
*  According to law enforcement sources, there is no known record filed with the New York [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=102.48s)]
*  in the last three years showing that George Santos claimed to be the victim of a robbery [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=109.08s)]
*  on Fifth Avenue. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=113.84s)]
*  Same goes for Anthony Devolder, which is another name George Santos has used in the past. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=115.28s)]
*  No police report on file for either of those names reporting a robbery of shoes or anything [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=120.88s)]
*  else in New York City. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=125.52s)]
*  Nor is there any record of George Santos alerting the NYPD to an attempted murder against him. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=127.96s)]
*  According to those same law enforcement sources, there is just one police report on record [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=135.28s)]
*  that mentions George Santos. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=139.32s)]
*  It concerns an incident in 2021 where Mr. Santos' neighbor allegedly threw some garbage [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=141.44s)]
*  at him. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=146.88s)]
*  And while nobody likes to have garbage thrown at them, in this case, I'm happy to say Mr. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=148.16s)]
*  Santos reported that his neighbor missed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=151.4s)]
*  So one failed attempt by his neighbor to throw garbage at him once. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=154.04s)]
*  Yes, there was a police report about that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=158.36s)]
*  Nothing about an attempted murder, nothing about a mugging specific to his shoes or not. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=161.48s)]
*  Our law enforcement sources checked their full log of police reports and complaints [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=167.56s)]
*  between January 2019 up to the end of last month. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=170.72s)]
*  They tell us to the best of their knowledge, aside from that one complaint about the neighbor [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  lobbing trash in his general direction, but not right at him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  George Santos, apart from that, George Santos apart from that had not filed a single police [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  report or complaint to the NYPD in any of the last three years. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=186.2s)]
*  Now we reached out to Congressman Santos's office to ask him about all of this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=191.28s)]
*  His office told us that this isn't a congressional issue and so we should therefore ask his lawyer. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=195.12s)]
*  We did. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=200.8s)]
*  His lawyer told us no comment. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=201.8s)]
*  And look, who knows, maybe Republican Congressman George Santos decided to deal with that mugging [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=204.24s)]
*  in Manhattan on his own. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=211.62s)]
*  Maybe he summoned that police escort with his mind. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=214.2s)]
*  We checked it out and it doesn't seem to have gone down the way you might have expected. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7Ethrc_oYY&t=219.22s)]
