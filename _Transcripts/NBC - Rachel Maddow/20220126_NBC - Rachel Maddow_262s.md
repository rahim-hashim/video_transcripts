# Democrats Aim For Quick Confirmation Of Biden Nominee; Alert To McConnell Dirty Tricks
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA)
*  How do Democrats plan to get this done and what dirty tricks are they on the alert for? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Minnesota Democratic Senator, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=4.9s)]
*  Senator Amy Klobuchar. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=10.36s)]
*  Let's talk about how this process is going to go. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=11.36s)]
*  So I am usually, we know how these things go by the book, but we also know how perverted [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=14.24s)]
*  the process has been in recent years by the stuff that Mitch McConnell has been willing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=19.8s)]
*  to do in both with open seats and to fill seats. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=23.68s)]
*  Are you worried about there being shenanigans or dirty tricks that you haven't previously [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=28.74s)]
*  had to deal with in terms of filling this seat? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=32.58s)]
*  Well, we're used to it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=34.82s)]
*  I mean, they throw everything at these nominees and we must be ready to defend them and make [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=36.82s)]
*  the case for them because they themselves can't go on TV. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=42.08s)]
*  I remember playing this role when Elena Kagan was nominated, when Sonia Sotomayor and making [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=45.459999999999994s)]
*  getting the true facts out there about their record and their story. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=51.94s)]
*  What we have here is very different situation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  It is a 50-50 Senate, but Dick Durbin controls the gavel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=59.82s)]
*  And I will say under his leadership and Senator Schumer's leadership on the floor has been [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=64.18s)]
*  noted, we have confirmed more judges last year than any president has put forth since [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=68.74s)]
*  Ronald Reagan, since he started your show that way. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=77.06s)]
*  So we have a lot of experience getting this done. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=79.88s)]
*  We have a White House that has vetted a number of nominees, well aware that this could be [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=82.3s)]
*  coming down the pike. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=86.82s)]
*  We have so much respect for Justice Breyer and his incredible record, but they knew there [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=88.14s)]
*  was a chance he would step down. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=92.89999999999999s)]
*  So I feel like we're in about as good a situation as we can be. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=95.3s)]
*  And so after the nomination is made, you look at the numbers, Sotomayor was 66 days, Kagan [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=98.94s)]
*  was 87 days, Gorsuch was 65 days, Kavanaugh was 88 days, and of course, Barrett is united 27 days. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=106.6s)]
*  But who's counting? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=116.44s)]
*  I think everyone will be. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=118.16s)]
*  And so a lot of this will be we then meet with the nominees. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=119.88s)]
*  They try to meet with everyone on the committee as well as other senators. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=124.08s)]
*  And we have a judicial questionnaire that some of them filled out in the last few years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  So that's helpful. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=133.0s)]
*  They have a head start. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=133.84s)]
*  And then Senator Durbin schedules the hearing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=135.72s)]
*  It's usually, as you know, a day of openings and then from the senators and the opening [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=138.88s)]
*  statement of the nominee and then a day or two days of questions and then usually a panel of experts at the end. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=143.88s)]
*  Because we're 50-50, you don't have that immediate vote out of committee unless we do pick up a Republican vote. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  And Republicans have in the last few decades voted for nominees from Democratic presidents. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=158.0s)]
*  And so recall that if that happens, then we get out. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=164.04s)]
*  If it doesn't, if it's split, then we will have you something called rule 14, which will allow Senator Durbin to give this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=167.48s)]
*  Senator Schumer basically, and it goes to the floor for a vote. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=177.96s)]
*  But yeah, when you're 50-50, it makes for more shenanigans. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=181.16s)]
*  And Senator, in terms of the timing from the White House, how important is it? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=185.8s)]
*  The timing in terms of when you first get the name of the nominee? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, the process has to take as long as the process is going to take once it's formally before the Judiciary Committee and then the Senate. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=194.84s)]
*  But how quickly should the White House act here? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=201.0s)]
*  Well, they'll want to interview people because even though they know this might be coming, I would assume that President Biden, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  with his vast experience, former chair of the Judiciary Committee, knows the importance of talking to the nominees. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  So I assume he will get it down to a few people and then give us a name. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  But of course, the sooner the better. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=220.44s)]
*  And I think that was what was so good about the timing of Justice Breyer's announcement. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=222.24s)]
*  He knows what's going on. He knows this isn't an easy situation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=228.44s)]
*  Anyone that watches C-SPAN realizes that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=231.84s)]
*  And so not waiting till the very end or the beginning of the term makes this a lot more doable. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Z0UsJHcGA&t=235.2s)]
