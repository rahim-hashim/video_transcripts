Video Description: Ari Melber and an MSNBC panel discuss the revelation at the fourth January 6th hearing that a staffer for Senator Ron Johnson tried to arrange giving lists of fake electors to Mike Pence, and Johnson's apparent extreme discomfort with discussing the matter, possibly a reflection of the legal liability he senses.

# Why Ron Johnson Is Right To Worry About Trump's Fake Elector Scheme
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo)
*  A staffer for Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson texted a staffer for Vice President Pence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=0.0s)]
*  just minutes before the beginning of the joint session. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=4.88s)]
*  This staffer stated that Senator Johnson wished to hand-deliver to the vice president the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=7.84s)]
*  fake electors' votes from Michigan and Wisconsin. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=11.8s)]
*  The vice president's aide unambiguously instructed them not to deliver the fake votes to the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  vice president. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=19.28s)]
*  Do not give that to him. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=20.28s)]
*  Do not, nope. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Do not, stop. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=23.6s)]
*  This is a... [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=24.68s)]
*  Now, wait, there's a little bit of an update actually on this part of the amazing story [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=26.16s)]
*  since the hearing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=30.2s)]
*  On that last point, that Republican U.S. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin offered to hand courier [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=31.48s)]
*  to the vice president on January 6th the forged certificates for fake Trump electors. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean, that was some new news today. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=41.8s)]
*  But after that was revealed at the hearing, Senator Ron Johnson made very clear to reporters [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  that he does not want to talk about it to the point where he will fake being on the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=49.8s)]
*  phone to avoid answering their questions about it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=53.68s)]
*  How much did you know about what your chief of staff was doing with the alternate sleights [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  of electors? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=62.88s)]
*  I'm not on the phone right now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=63.88s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=66.88s)]
*  I can see your phone. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=67.88s)]
*  I can see your screen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=68.88s)]
*  Can you explain what your chief of staff was doing? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=69.88s)]
*  Does your chief of staff still work for you, Senator? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=76.88s)]
*  Can you explain what happened there? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=79.88s)]
*  Why was your chief of staff even offering this to the vice president? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=82.08s)]
*  This is a complete non-story. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=86.08s)]
*  We've issued statements. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=88.08s)]
*  And this is a non-story. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=90.08s)]
*  I don't know what you're even concerned about. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=92.08s)]
*  Well, they said that your chief of staff was saying that you offered, you wanted to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=97.08s)]
*  provide alternate electors in Michigan with the help of the vice president Mike Pence. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=102.08s)]
*  This was a staff-to-staff exchange. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=106.28s)]
*  And I was basically unaware of it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=109.28s)]
*  And the chief of staff contacted the vice president's staff, said, do you want this? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=112.28s)]
*  They said no. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=117.28s)]
*  And we didn't deliver it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=118.28s)]
*  And that's the end of the story. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=119.28s)]
*  But why was he even asking for that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=120.28s)]
*  Because somebody delivered this to our office and asked to deliver that to the vice president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=122.28s)]
*  Did you support his efforts to try to get those sleights to the vice president? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=127.28s)]
*  No, I had no knowledge of this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=131.28s)]
*  Who is the person that did that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=133.28s)]
*  I had no involvement in an alternate slate of electors. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=134.48s)]
*  I had no idea this thing would be delivered to us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=138.48s)]
*  It got delivered staff-to-staff. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=140.48s)]
*  My chief of staff did the right thing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=142.48s)]
*  Contact the vice president's staff. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=144.48s)]
*  They said they didn't want it, so we didn't deliver it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=146.48s)]
*  That's the end of the story. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=148.48s)]
*  A staff-to-staff contact. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=150.48s)]
*  Yeah, to be clear, it was his chief of staff asking for Senator Ron Johnson to be allowed [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=152.48s)]
*  to have direct contact with the vice president so he could hand convey these forged documents. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=158.48s)]
*  I had no knowledge of this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=163.67999999999998s)]
*  You know, I was in the airport. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=166.67999999999998s)]
*  A guy came up to me. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  He handed me this bag. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  It was ticking and it had fertilizer coming out of it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't know who he is. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=174.67999999999998s)]
*  He asked me to bring it on the plane. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  I just brought it on the plane. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  Staff-to-staff. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  Staff-to-staff. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  Staff-to-staff. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  Staff-to-staff. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  Somebody said, I can see your phone. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  How bad is the fake electors plot? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=184.67999999999998s)]
*  It's so bad that Ron Johnson pretended to be on the phone. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  This is also pretty telling in terms of how concerned these guys actually are about potential [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=190.88s)]
*  complicity in criminal acts. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  Still with me here in the studio are my colleagues Chris Hayes, Joy Reid, Nicole Wallace. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  We are joined now by Ari Melber, MSNBC chief legal correspondent, the host of The Beat. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Ari, when a senator pretends to be on a phone call and he isn't, as Nicole pointed out, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=207.28s)]
*  that usually indicates that he's a little bit concerned about what he's being asked [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=212.68s)]
*  about. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=215.68s)]
*  I think that a non-story doesn't overshadow his very obvious efforts to avoid talking [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=216.68s)]
*  about it, which makes it seem like a very big story. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=222.32s)]
*  Is there, now that we know that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the fake electors [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=225.22s)]
*  thing though, is somebody like Ron Johnson right to worry about being implicated with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=229.24s)]
*  this plot? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=234.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=235.36s)]
*  I mean, it is bizarre and baroque but also important. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=236.36s)]
*  I think you put your finger exactly on it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=238.28s)]
*  The facts matter, the evidence is breaking through, and not only to the public that's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=241.32s)]
*  watching these but to the people at DOJ that are monitoring them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=245.29999999999998s)]
*  So the usual duck and lie defense is giving way to much more careful denials. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=248.54s)]
*  The idea that on the certification day of this election with everything that everyone [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=255.54s)]
*  had lived through up until that point, Mr. Johnson's office was doubling as a kind of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=262.34s)]
*  a homemade postal service is absurd. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=266.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's what we do. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  We process mail for the vice president and hand it to him before the senate. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=271.26s)]
*  I hate to do this but to paraphrase Biggie Smalls, don't be mad UPS is hiring. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=275.82s)]
*  It's like you don't work at UPS, you're not the mail bag for the vice president. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=283.78s)]
*  And by the way, again, I know I'm saying something very obvious but to the extent that the Trump [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=289.14s)]
*  view and or argument needed an airing, he is the number two official in the Trump administration. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=293.53999999999996s)]
*  He's a member of the losing campaign. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  He was familiar with all that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=302.90000000000003s)]
*  So to circle back to end on your question, Rachel, the legal problem is you can lie on [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=303.98s)]
*  the street, you can lie on TV, you cannot lie to the government. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=309.34000000000003s)]
*  You can lie in front of the courthouse but when you walk inside it, it's perjury. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=314.12s)]
*  You can lie in front of the congress but when you walk inside and submit fraudulent documents, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=317.98s)]
*  even if you are in the government and sometimes especially because it could be a second charge, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=322.26s)]
*  you're in a different turf. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxywEn3fvCo&t=326.5s)]
