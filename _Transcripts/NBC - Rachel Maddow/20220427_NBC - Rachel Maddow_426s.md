# Donald Trump No Less Dangerous For Being A Ridiculous Buffoon
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY)
*  The Washington Post tonight is reporting that among the things the January 6th investigation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=0.0s)]
*  in Congress is looking at is a number of different ways that Trump and his administration and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=4.88s)]
*  people around him tried to get him to use the emergency powers of the president, which [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  technically at least are a very limited thing, but how he tried to use them or considered [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=15.5s)]
*  using them to overthrow the election. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=19.56s)]
*  The Post reporting tonight that, quote, three days before Biden's inauguration, Congresswoman [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=21.48s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene texted the White House chief of staff and told him that some Republican [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=25.76s)]
*  members of Congress believe the only path for President Trump to change the outcome [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  of the election and stay in power was for him to declare martial law. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=33.64s)]
*  The text from Greene, which was revealed this week, brought to the fore the chorus of Republicans [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=37.44s)]
*  who were publicly and privately advocating for Trump to try to use the military and defense [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=41.92s)]
*  apparatus of the U.S. government to strong arm his way past an electoral defeat. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=46.88s)]
*  Now, discussions involving the Trump White House about using emergency powers have become [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=51.76s)]
*  an important but little known part of the January 6th investigation of the attack on [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=58.08s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  The Post says, quote, in subpoenas, document requests and court filings, the panels demanded [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  information about any Trump administration plans to use presidential emergency powers [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=67.48s)]
*  to invoke martial law or take other steps to overturn the election. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=72.88s)]
*  Interviews with committee members and a review of the panel's information requests reveals [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=76.64s)]
*  a focus on emergency powers that were being considered by Trump and his allies in several [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=80.4s)]
*  categories, invoking the Insurrection Act, declaring martial law, using presidential [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=84.56s)]
*  powers to justify seizing voting machines and using the military to require a rerun [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  of the election. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=95.92s)]
*  Again, the Post reporting that those efforts to use presidential emergency powers to overthrow [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=96.92s)]
*  the election is a new and largely sort of overlooked publicly and publicly overlooked [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=102.28s)]
*  part of what the January 6th investigation is looking at. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=109.04s)]
*  What does this new reporting mean? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=112.56s)]
*  And is this a whole new level of seriousness we hadn't really considered before? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Elizabeth Gautin. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=120.0s)]
*  She is co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=121.48s)]
*  Justice, and she's in fact one of the experts on presidential emergency powers, as quoted [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=124.72s)]
*  in the Post's reporting today. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=129.44s)]
*  In the Post reporting, she argues that the emergency powers, quote, contain fundamental [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=131.0s)]
*  flaws that could lead to abuse, and she has said that these emergency powers should be [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=135.52s)]
*  a focus of the January 6th investigation. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=140.88000000000002s)]
*  Ms. Gautin, it's a real pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=145.28s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=146.28s)]
*  So I've always sort of been led to believe that emergency powers for a president or indeed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=149.12s)]
*  an administration, particularly around elections, are quite limited, but it sounds like the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  January 6th investigators have got their teeth into a number of different ways that those [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  powers were at least attempted to be tapped by Trump and his allies in 2020. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=163.72s)]
*  I think the truth lies somewhere between what you thought about emergency powers and what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  Michael Flynn and Sidney Powell and and Marjorie Taylor Queen were urging President Trump to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  do. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=182.32s)]
*  Emergency powers do not give the president limitless ability to do whatever he wants, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=183.4s)]
*  such as seizing voting machines and overturning the results of an election. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=187.56s)]
*  In fact, there are no emergency powers that would allow a president to overturn the results [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=191.16s)]
*  of an election after those results are in. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=196.48s)]
*  However, there are emergency powers available to the president that are disturbingly broad [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=198.76s)]
*  and that lack checks and balances that are necessary to ensure that they can't be used [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  in ways that could undermine our democracy in other ways. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=210.72s)]
*  So I think it is absolutely a legitimate cause for concern, something the January 6th Committee [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=214.2s)]
*  should be looking at very closely. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=219.4s)]
*  One of the key points of any congressional investigation, I mean, sort of a point almost [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=222.4s)]
*  literally, one of the key aims, one of the key reasons to justify creating congressional [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  investigations is to recommend legislative changes, since that, after all, is the main [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  purview of Congress. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=239.44000000000003s)]
*  If the January 6th investigators are looking at this, obviously it's going to potentially [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  reveal more to us about what the components were of the plot and who was trying to get [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=245.68s)]
*  away with what. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=249.68s)]
*  But is it conceivable to you as an expert in this field that they could also recommend [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=250.68s)]
*  practical changes that the Congress itself could fix ahead of the 2024 election to alleviate [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=254.76s)]
*  some of the concerns that you're just describing? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  Let's take the National Emergencies Act, which allows the president to declare a national [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  emergency pretty much within his discretion just by signing an executive order. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=268.4s)]
*  And then that declaration unlocks enhanced powers that are contained in more than 120 [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=272.68s)]
*  different laws. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=278.36s)]
*  Some of those powers are what keep me awake at night, including laws that would allow [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=279.48s)]
*  the president to take over or shut down communications facilities, laws that would allow the president [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=284.8s)]
*  to freeze Americans' assets and prevent anyone from doing any kind of financial transaction [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=290.48s)]
*  with them, laws that even allow the president to suspend the prohibition on government-tapped [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=296.12s)]
*  testing of chemical and biological agents on unwitting human subjects. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=302.64000000000004s)]
*  There are emergency powers that allow these things. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=306.32000000000005s)]
*  So absolutely, I think Congress should be thinking about ways to rein in some of these [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=308.44s)]
*  emergency powers, but also the very basic check that Congress should be able to shut [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  down and abuse of emergency powers by the president. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=320.44s)]
*  And right now, the only way Congress can do that is to pass a law by a veto-proof supermajority. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=323.44s)]
*  And there are better ways to do it, such as allowing an emergency declaration to stay [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=329.12s)]
*  in effect for 30 days, but to terminate at that point if Congress hasn't approved the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=333.44s)]
*  declaration. And that's part of some legislation that's been considered by Congress now. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=338.28s)]
*  One other law that I think is important to look at is the Insurrection Act. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=343.28s)]
*  And this is a law that allows the president, again, with a tremendous amount of discretion, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=346.76s)]
*  to deploy federal troops to act as a domestic police force. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=351.72s)]
*  And that is something that in general, our laws, our constitution really frown on that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=356.23999999999995s)]
*  because the founders knew that an army turned inward can quickly become an instrument of [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=361.28s)]
*  tyranny. But this law, the Insurrection Act, is really an exception. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=366.64s)]
*  It gives the president a tremendous discretion to deploy troops to address not only insurrections, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=370.2s)]
*  as the name would suggest, but also to address domestic violence, which isn't defined, to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  address unlawful combinations or conspiracies, again, not defined. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=381.76000000000005s)]
*  So this very vague and frankly archaic language of the statute hasn't been updated in 150 [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=386.92s)]
*  years gives the president a dangerous amount of authority. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=392.92s)]
*  Again, what it means is more specific definitions and checks and balances, some provision [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=397.04s)]
*  for Congress and the courts to step in if the president overreacts. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTiRj_WXjqY&t=402.32000000000005s)]
