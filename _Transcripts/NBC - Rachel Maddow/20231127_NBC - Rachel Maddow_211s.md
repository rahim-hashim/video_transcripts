# Republican refusal to certify local election results seen as dress rehearsal for 2024 chaos
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw)
*  Just before the Thanksgiving break, we got the worrying but also totally inevitable feeling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=0.0s)]
*  news about Republican officials in three different counties in Georgia deciding that they would [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=6.92s)]
*  refuse to certify this year's election results. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=14.48s)]
*  These are Republican officials in three different counties who refused to vote to certify their [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=17.68s)]
*  county's local election results from earlier this month. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  These were run-of-the-mill elections, run-of-the-mill election results. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=27.68s)]
*  There was not necessarily anything wrong with these elections or with the results. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=32.24s)]
*  The elections basically went off just fine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=36.4s)]
*  It's just that they're Republican elections officials, and so why would they vote to certify [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=39.8s)]
*  an election result? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=44.28s)]
*  This is just kind of becoming the default Republican position now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=46.46s)]
*  Elections are inherently suspect, all of them, and you can't count on Republican officials [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  to certify those results. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=55.86s)]
*  Not everywhere, at least. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=58.98s)]
*  In these three Georgia counties, these Republican officials were outvoted, and the results were [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=62.3s)]
*  therefore certified. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=67.26s)]
*  But Georgia Republicans are pretty clearly telegraphing their intentions for next year, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  when, you know, amid lots of other important things, the presidential race could very easily [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=74.38s)]
*  come down to a closely fought swing state like Georgia. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=79.5s)]
*  One county board refusing to certify its election results could throw the whole state, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=82.78s)]
*  and therefore the whole election, into chaos. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=87.8s)]
*  So good times. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=90.4s)]
*  That's ahead. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Georgia. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  And simultaneously, we've also now got several suburbs north of Atlanta that are in Fulton [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=95.22s)]
*  County, Georgia, but they no longer want Fulton County to run their elections. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  These conservative-leaning suburbs have declared that they don't trust Fulton County, so they [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=106.4s)]
*  want to run their elections themselves as individual towns. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=110.62s)]
*  They want to run them the way they did in the horse and buggy days. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=114.17999999999999s)]
*  These towns want Fulton County to take their fancy new-fangled voting machines and, you [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=117.98s)]
*  know, put them where the sun doesn't shine. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=122.62s)]
*  These towns are saying they will hand count all their ballots, thank you very much, with [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=125.44s)]
*  like an abacus and a my pillow. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=129.5s)]
*  It'll all be so much cheaper. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=131.46s)]
*  How much could it cost to run an election and hand count thousands of ballots? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=133.74s)]
*  This plan is in part the brainchild of one of Georgia's fake Republican electors, one [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=139.22s)]
*  of the folks who submitted forged documents claiming that Trump had won the state of Georgia [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=144.46s)]
*  in 2020, one of the people who's now under investigation by Fulton County prosecutors. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=149.22s)]
*  And you will be shocked to learn that earlier this month, when they tried this new old-fangled [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=154.76s)]
*  horse and buggy system in one of these towns, voters ended up having less than half the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=160.6s)]
*  polling places that were usually available to them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=165.78s)]
*  It took much longer to count the votes, and it didn't save any money. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=168.24s)]
*  It might have even cost more. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=172.4s)]
*  Other than that, though, it went great. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=174.4s)]
*  So Georgia is rejecting modern voting systems and also rejecting totally normal election [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=177.24s)]
*  results out of hand because that's what Republicans do now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=184.52s)]
*  Other than that, though, things looking good. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A0lBO5c8Iw&t=188.8s)]
