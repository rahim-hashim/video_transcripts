# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 17
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY)
*  First of all, I want you to see if you notice a pattern here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm going to show you something and I want to see if, see if you can sense some consistency [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=4.2s)]
*  over time here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=12.08s)]
*  I'm going to put a date stamp in the corner of the screen so you can see when all of these [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  happened but see if you can pick up on the pattern among them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=18.68s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=23.72s)]
*  After ascertainment has been had that the certificates are authentic [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=24.72s)]
*  and correct in form. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=29.96s)]
*  The tellers will count and make a list of the votes cast by [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=31.72s)]
*  the electors. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  After ascertainment has been made that the certificates are authentic and correct in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  form. The tellers will count and make a list of the votes cast by the electors. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=50.02s)]
*  After ascertaining that certificates are regular, informed, and authentic, the tellers will announce [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=55.86s)]
*  the votes cast by the electors. After ascertainment has been had that the certificates are authentic [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=61.78s)]
*  and correct in form, the tellers will count and make a list of the votes cast by the electors. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=68.18s)]
*  After ascertainment has been had that certificates are authentic and correct in form, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=74.42s)]
*  the tellers will count and make a list of the votes cast by the electors. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=79.54s)]
*  After the ascertainment has been had that the certificates are authentic and correct in form, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=83.46000000000001s)]
*  the tellers will count and make a list of the votes cast by the electors. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=89.06s)]
*  Notice a theme? It's a script, right? It's always the same. Every four years, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=94.98s)]
*  whoever is acting as the president of the Senate, whoever the vice president is, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=101.78s)]
*  it comes time every four years for them to open up and count all the electoral votes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=106.02s)]
*  And it's always the same. I mean, with one or two little word shifts here and there, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=111.78s)]
*  it's always the same thing. After ascertaining that the certificates are authentic and correct, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=116.58s)]
*  the tellers will announce the votes cast by the electors. They say the exact same thing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=121.22s)]
*  every four years. The words shift like a hair or two in either direction, but it's always the same [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=125.22s)]
*  every four years until this last time. This last time for the first time ever started off just like [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=130.18s)]
*  it always does, but then it careened off in a whole new direction we've never heard before. Watch. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=137.54000000000002s)]
*  After ascertaining that the certificates are regular in form and authentic, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=145.38s)]
*  the tellers will announce the votes cast by the electors for each state beginning with Alabama, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=150.02s)]
*  which the parliamentarians advise me is the only certificate of vote [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=156.26s)]
*  from that state and purports to be a return from the state that has annexed to it a certificate [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=160.5s)]
*  from an authority of that state purporting to appoint or ascertain electors. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=166.82s)]
*  What was all that at the end? All that stuff that the parliamentarian has advised you, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=174.66s)]
*  that was all new. As far as we can tell, nothing like that has ever been said at any one of these [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=179.62s)]
*  things. But Mike Pence, when he opened the electoral votes January 6th last year, he added that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=185.62s)]
*  whole new bit. The parliamentarian has advised me there's only one document that counts as a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=192.9s)]
*  certificate of vote from a state and that certificate, he says, has annexed to it a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=197.46s)]
*  certificate from an authority of that state. That's all new language that we've never heard before in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=203.46s)]
*  this context. Vice presidents always say the exact same thing when it comes time for them to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=208.98s)]
*  announce the electoral college votes. But when Mike Pence did it, he added this whole new complicated [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=214.1s)]
*  clause saying the parliamentarian had advised him that only one certificate of electors could [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=220.33999999999997s)]
*  be counted from any one state. It had to have the explicit blessing of an authority of that state. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  That was all new. And, you know, there's been some minor drama around the electoral college [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=233.54s)]
*  before in previous elections. But no vice president ever before felt the need to get a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=239.78s)]
*  parliamentarian's ruling, basically giving him a clear legal way to assert that he doesn't have [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=244.82s)]
*  to count any forged fake set of electors that might have been sent into him alongside the real ones. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=252.26s)]
*  No vice president has ever before had to get some sort of language from the parliamentarian [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  explaining that if two sets of electors were sent in from a particular state, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=264.58s)]
*  he was only going to have to count the one. But Mike Pence had to do that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  Which means Vice President Mike Pence knew in advance of January 6th that Republicans in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=276.09999999999997s)]
*  multiple states had sent in forged fake electoral votes, documents purporting to be the real [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=281.14s)]
*  electoral votes from those states, even though they were not real. We know he knew about it [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=286.58s)]
*  because we can see he had to maneuver in advance of actually conducting the vote count that day [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=291.7s)]
*  to get the parliamentarian to give him that language so he could justify not counting the fake votes. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=297.46s)]
*  Reporter Kyle Cheney at politico.com gets credit for catching this [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=305.7s)]
*  and catching it at an auspicious time. It was 2 55 in the morning on the night of January 6th, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=309.78s)]
*  last year, 2 55 a.m. January 7th is the night after the Capitol had been attacked. Kyle Cheney [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=316.42s)]
*  that night made note of how Pence's language seemed to be different than all previous vice [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=322.18s)]
*  presidents had used for every previous electoral vote count. Mr. Cheney was totally right. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=329.22s)]
*  It's totally obvious once you lay down what Pence said, all that extra verbiage that Pence added [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=334.5s)]
*  alongside the very austere, almost exactly unchanging language from all the other times [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=340.26s)]
*  the vice president has done the vote count in modern times. Reporter Kyle Cheney figured that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=346.26s)]
*  out based on the change language that Pence used. Figured out that that that vice president Pence's [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=351.21999999999997s)]
*  office must have worked with the Senate parliamentarian ahead of time to head off this stunt, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=356.02s)]
*  to head off this part of the plot, to head off what Republicans are trying to do sending in these [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=361.7s)]
*  forged electoral college votes, which they did in fact not just fill out and keep, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=366.9s)]
*  they filled them out, signed them and sent them into the National Archives and to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=373.38s)]
*  the United States Senate as if they were real. Look at this. This was last week in Florida. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=378.17999999999995s)]
*  They finally held a special congressional election to fill the seat of the late Democratic [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=385.53999999999996s)]
*  Congressman Elsie Hastings, who died in April. Congressman Hastings' district is really [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=390.34s)]
*  Democratic. It was therefore always really likely that the district would be electing another [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=394.74s)]
*  Democrat to succeed him. I think that's probably why Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=401.86s)]
*  just refused to hold the election to fill that seat for as long as he possibly could. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=406.66s)]
*  As long as no election was held to fill the Elsie Hastings seat, then Democrats would be down one [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=410.66s)]
*  of their numbers in the United States House of Representatives. He held off and held off and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=415.62s)]
*  said there are rules about these things. He did get sued to finally hold the election. Finally, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=421.06s)]
*  we did get that election last week, more than nine months after Congressman Elsie Hastings died. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=426.18s)]
*  Like I said, this is a really Democratic district. The Democratic primary for that seat was super hot [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=432.42s)]
*  and heavy, tons of candidates, a really close race. Ultimately, I think the successful candidate in [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=437.78000000000003s)]
*  the Democratic primary won the primary by only five votes, five votes. Even by that exceedingly [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=442.58000000000004s)]
*  narrow margin, she did win the Democratic primary, which meant she was the Democrat on the ballot in [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=450.18s)]
*  the special election last week. And she won the general election. She won the special election [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=455.54s)]
*  last week in an absolute landslide. Her name is Sheila Sherfulis McCormick, and she was the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=461.14s)]
*  Democratic contender for that seat. She's got a great story. Actually, she's the child of Haitian [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=468.42s)]
*  immigrants. Her parents were a taxi driver and a maid. She is now a lawyer and the CEO of a health [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=473.22s)]
*  care company. And thanks to her blowout victory in that congressional election last week, she's [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=479.78s)]
*  now the first Haitian American ever elected to Congress from Florida, only the second Haitian [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=484.26s)]
*  American ever elected to Congress ever. Like I said, great story, all because she just cleaned [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=489.05999999999995s)]
*  up in that race. She got 79% of the vote in that election last week. The Republican who ran against [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=495.05999999999995s)]
*  her got less than 20% of the vote. Her margin of victory in that special election was almost 60 [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=501.46s)]
*  points, just a complete blowout. But because of where the Republican party is right now and what [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=508.26s)]
*  they are now wired for, that Republican who ran against Sheila Sherfulis McCormick, he's refusing [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=515.9399999999999s)]
*  to concede and is contesting the results. And he's brought a lawsuit to try to block the result. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=523.54s)]
*  He said after the, he said after election night, quote, I did not win, so they say. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=530.34s)]
*  He recently told one CBS station in Florida, quote, we'll have some stuff coming out that we've [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=535.7s)]
*  recently discovered. Dude lost this race by, by 60 points. He did not break 20% of the vote in a [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=539.86s)]
*  two way race. I didn't win, so they say. Republicans now, any race, anywhere in the country, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=550.98s)]
*  any margin of loss, doesn't matter. Why would they accept an election result unless they won? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=564.42s)]
*  Why would any Republican losing any election anywhere in the country from this point forward [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=574.5s)]
*  admit that they had lost, concede, and congratulate their opponent? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=580.42s)]
*  I think that's the way to get ahead in the Republican party right now. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=584.98s)]
*  Sheila Sherfulis McCormick will be sworn in tomorrow on Capitol Hill. Her Republican opponent, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=587.7s)]
*  who she beat by more than, by nearly 60 points, he is not conceding that she won that race, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=592.9s)]
*  even as she is slated to be sworn in. Because Republicans, because that's the way the Republican [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=598.98s)]
*  party works now. They are a post-election party. At the rally, former president Trump held in Arizona [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=605.3000000000001s)]
*  this weekend. One of the Republicans who signed the forged elector document from Arizona, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=612.9s)]
*  he spoke as one of the warmup acts for Trump. Because why not? This is what a rally is like [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=617.46s)]
*  now for the presumed Republican presidential nominee in the next election. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=623.38s)]
*  Who won the election? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=629.62s)]
*  You're right. Trump won. Trump won. We are going to fix 2020. I heard the news. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=633.46s)]
*  We are going to fix 2020. I hope that we're going to decertify 2020. How about you? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=639.86s)]
*  And no more are they going to be able to get away with this kind of deception, this kind of fraud, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=648.5s)]
*  and illegal activity. Not only people in general, but the election workers. We want [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=655.62s)]
*  indictments of the election workers so that they don't continue to do this. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=661.62s)]
*  I've had several media outlets call me, Washington Post, CNN, and they want to know [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=666.34s)]
*  why I was a Trump elector. Donald Trump won this election. And I call upon the Arizona legislature [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=672.5s)]
*  to vote to decertify the 2020 election. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=679.62s)]
*  Putting the people who signed the forged elector paperwork up on stage so everybody can cheer for [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=686.74s)]
*  them, to get them warmed up for cheering for the former president. This kind of stuff does seem [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=695.38s)]
*  crazy. This seems like the whole vibe on the Trump rally thing is kind of low-rent and out there. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=702.18s)]
*  But this is what it's like in the Republican Party right now. This is how they are gearing [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=707.94s)]
*  up for the next election. Indict the election workers. But it is working for them as planned, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=712.26s)]
*  even in the high-rent districts. The new Texas voting restrictions were, like in many states, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=718.42s)]
*  they were passed on the pretext that all that election fraud that made the last election [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=725.3s)]
*  stolen, that justified lots of new laws in Texas to make it harder to vote in that state. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=728.9799999999999s)]
*  That's paying off already. You saw the headline this weekend. Election officials in Texas reject [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=733.38s)]
*  hundreds of ballot applications under the state's new voting restrictions. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=737.9399999999999s)]
*  Quote, election officials in one of the most populous counties in Texas have rejected about [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=741.4599999999999s)]
*  of the applications for ballots because of the state's new voting restrictions enacted by [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=745.6999999999999s)]
*  Republicans last year. Texas Republicans last year passed their bill establishing new limits [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=749.6999999999999s)]
*  on voting over the objections of Democrats, part of a wave of efforts led by Republican-led states, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=754.26s)]
*  excuse me, a wave of efforts by Republican-led states to impose new restrictions. Many in the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=759.3s)]
*  Republican Party echoed former President Donald Trump's baseless claims of widespread voter fraud [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=764.5799999999999s)]
*  in the 2020 election in arguing for the new restrictions. The county clerk's office in [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=769.14s)]
*  Travis County, the fifth most populous county and home to Texas's capital of Austin, cited the new [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=774.34s)]
*  law's recent changes to ID requirements in rejecting about half of the 700 applications [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=780.02s)]
*  for mail-in ballots. They're throwing out half the ballot applications [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=786.82s)]
*  because the new restrictive voting law says they have to be. Because, and you had to pass [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=794.26s)]
*  that voting restriction law because of all the fraud, decertify, decertify. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=799.54s)]
*  It's working perfectly for them. I mean, it looks crazy to the rest of the country, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=805.4599999999999s)]
*  but it is working perfectly for them. And what's to stop them? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=809.54s)]
*  What do you say to your constituents and voting rights advocates who are growing [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=816.42s)]
*  concerned if either bill isn't passed as we approach the 2022 midterm elections? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=820.3399999999999s)]
*  I feel sorry for those on the other side who didn't support this. You know, we're very clear. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=825.62s)]
*  Our constituents understand where we are. Our constituents understand at all levels. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=836.18s)]
*  They understand victory. They saw a black president elected because they voted and they stood in line [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=844.66s)]
*  for five to seven hours to vote. You have heard the president himself say, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=851.22s)]
*  thank you, majority whip Clyburn. Thank you, South Carolina. Thank you, black people [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=858.58s)]
*  for voting overwhelmingly to elect him. That then got us our first female black [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=866.02s)]
*  Asian American vice president. Our people know that. Our people understand that. Who should be afraid? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=873.38s)]
*  Those who won't stand up for voting rights. So we're sending a clarion call and you can print this. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=881.38s)]
*  Shame on you for not doing it. Black folks will vote no matter what. So it's not what's going to [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=887.62s)]
*  happen to us. It's what's going to happen to them. It's not what's going to happen to us. It is what's [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=894.34s)]
*  going to happen to them. You can print that. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty is chair of the [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=901.46s)]
*  Congressional Black Caucus. That was her speaking last week about the fight to pass voting rights [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=907.0600000000001s)]
*  in Congress and those who are on the wrong side of that vote and the wrong side of that history [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=911.86s)]
*  and her estimation. And she joins us live now. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, chair of the Congressional [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=916.98s)]
*  Black Caucus. Madam Chair, it's a real pleasure to have you here tonight of all nights. Thank you so [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=921.7s)]
*  much for making time. No, thank you so much for asking me to be on your show. Today is a special [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=926.58s)]
*  day with the nation watching. The nation is watching and a lot of the nation I think is [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=933.06s)]
*  holding their breath about what's going to happen tomorrow. We played some words from [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=939.3s)]
*  Martin Luther King III from the March Today held under that banner, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=945.6999999999999s)]
*  deliver for voting rights, deliver being the operative phrase there. Do you think that the [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=950.5799999999999s)]
*  United States will deliver? Are you optimistic about what's going to happen tomorrow? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=955.06s)]
*  I don't know exactly what will happen tomorrow. I know the nation is pained and frustrated because [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=959.14s)]
*  of what we've been going through. You know, we're looking at individuals who are not supporting [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=965.9399999999999s)]
*  reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act and four Republican presidents in a bipartisan fashion [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=971.9399999999999s)]
*  reauthorized it. Five presidents in our time have reauthorized it. So tomorrow it will be on [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=979.9399999999999s)]
*  the United States Senate to do their job. The House, we voted on voting rights more than three [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=987.54s)]
*  times. This is not new for us, but tomorrow you will see us standing and watching as history will [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=994.3399999999999s)]
*  be made. And let me just say this, for all those who don't support the Freedom to Vote John R. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1002.26s)]
*  Lewis Act, they're obstructionists and it will be on their hands because our communities and all of [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1009.38s)]
*  those who know what we have to lose, especially black and brown people have so much to lose that [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1016.98s)]
*  they will react, but you won't keep us from voting. And the senators should be scared about that [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1024.66s)]
*  because we know we don't cheat when it comes to elections. We get out, we stand in lines, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1032.66s)]
*  and no matter how they try to suppress the vote, Democrats and black and brown Americans will vote. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1038.3400000000001s)]
*  You've talked about the Congressional Black Caucus as being the conscience of the Congress [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1048.1000000000001s)]
*  on issues like this and so many others. I wonder if you can give us a little window into their [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1052.98s)]
*  strategic thinking right now. I mean, the way that you have turned that question on its head, the way [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1058.26s)]
*  you just did right now and the way we played that sound from you earlier speaking last week, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1061.7s)]
*  talking about how people who are opposing this are on the wrong side and they are the ones who [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1065.7s)]
*  need to worry about their futures in terms of how the politics of this will play out. I know that [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1069.46s)]
*  you are thinking about this in terms of three steps down the road, five steps down the road, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1074.5s)]
*  10 steps down the road. If things do fail tomorrow in the Senate, if Senator Mayorkas is [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1078.02s)]
*  if things do fail tomorrow in the Senate, if Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema decide that [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1084.18s)]
*  they want to go down in history this way for this reason, is there a way under, over, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1088.98s)]
*  or around that wall? Is there another way to approach it? Well, you're absolutely right. We [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1098.1000000000001s)]
*  have been strategizing and certainly as you said, the Congressional Black Caucus has been a leader [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1103.8600000000001s)]
*  in this. Six months ago, I got arrested. Other members have been out there marching, protesting, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1109.14s)]
*  writing legislation, trying to work with those on the other side of the aisle and our two senators [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1116.3400000000001s)]
*  over there who are having some initial problems that they are having, therefore the voting rights. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1122.74s)]
*  It is the big elephant in the room, the filibuster, but it reminds me of when Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1131.46s)]
*  and Fannie Lou Hamer and so many others were going across that Edmund Pettus Bridge. You know, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1138.34s)]
*  they didn't cross it the first or the second time. They turned around and came back and strategized, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1144.34s)]
*  but then there was Bloody Sunday and they got it done. I am saying to you, we won't give up. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1150.82s)]
*  We will go back and we will go back and we will get it right because the Voting Rights Act must [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1157.4599999999998s)]
*  be reauthorized. So we'll go back and we'll recraft and we'll re-strategize, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1163.86s)]
*  but we won't stop talking about it. We won't stop fighting for it. We won't give up. And so I am [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1170.02s)]
*  hopeful that we will get there. I am hopeful that we will have enough of the senators to do what's [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1176.74s)]
*  right. You know, someone said today if we had state rights in Washington, D.C., we wouldn't have this [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1183.86s)]
*  problem because we would have two senators who would be voting with us. Well, we don't have that, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1190.02s)]
*  but we will see what happens tomorrow. But there will be another tomorrow and another tomorrow. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1195.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJ83VK4QpY&t=1220.02s)]
