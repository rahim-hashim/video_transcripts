Video Description: Rachel Maddow shares the results of a new Gallup poll that shows Donald Trump underwater (with a bigger "disapprove" number than "approve") on every category of performance in the poll. In practical terms, that means Trump had to withdraw his nomination of Rep. Elise Stefanik to be UN ambassador because he is afraid of not being able to replace her House seat with another Republican and the House margin is too close to risk it.

# Underwater on everything: Americans disapprove of what Trump is doing on every issue in new poll
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658)
*  How does the American people like all of this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=0.0s)]
*  How does the American population feel about how things are turning out with Donald Trump [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=3.0s)]
*  being back in the White House, given that this is sort of the daily news now? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=8.6s)]
*  New polling from Gallup just out today shows that there is no issue on which the American [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=13.8s)]
*  people like what Trump is doing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=18.6s)]
*  His disapproval ratings are higher than his approval ratings on everything. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  He is 18 points underwater on his handling of the economy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=25.48s)]
*  He is 19 points underwater on his relations with Russia. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  He's underwater on his handling of the federal budget, on energy policy, on foreign affairs, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=33.72s)]
*  on the Ukraine War, on the environment, on even his relations with the dreaded news media. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  He is underwater on every single thing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=43.88s)]
*  New polling in the great state of Texas today shows that Trump's favorability rating in [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=49.08s)]
*  Texas has dropped 15 points since the election in November. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=53.88s)]
*  He is now underwater specifically in Texas and dropping like a stone. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=59.44s)]
*  Today Donald Trump pulled the nomination of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be his new [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=71.44s)]
*  So congratulations to the United Nations. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=73.52s)]
*  But Trump admitted the reason why he pulled her nomination. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=76.48s)]
*  He said the reason he pulled her nomination is because they don't want her to leave [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=79.54s)]
*  her seat in the House because the Republican majority is so thin. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=83.78s)]
*  Now if Elise Stefanik had left her seat in the House and become UN ambassador, which [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=89.34s)]
*  was the original plan, they would just hold an election to put somebody else in that seat, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=94.54s)]
*  right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  If another Republican was going to replace her in the House, of course it wouldn't [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  affect the size of their majority at all. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  Do you want to know why they pulled that nomination today? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=107.58s)]
*  They pulled that nomination today, clearly, because they were worried that another Republican [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=110.22s)]
*  would not replace Elise Stefanik. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=114.82s)]
*  That if they had to hold an election for that seat, they were worried they were going to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=117.58s)]
*  lose it and that a Democrat was going to flip that seat. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  Elise Stefanik won that seat in November by 24 points. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=126.22s)]
*  Twenty-four points. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=131.54s)]
*  Right now with what Trump is doing as president, right now with how the Republicans are performing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=134.68s)]
*  with Trump as president, right now, 24 points is not a comfortable enough margin for Republicans, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=139.6s)]
*  given how hard the country is swinging back against them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  Twenty-four points in November? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=150.96s)]
*  Looks like it might be a blue seat right about now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=152.96s)]
*  The real political leaders of this country are the people who are willing to get up in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  the morning and go do something. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  They're doing it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=164.52s)]
*  And in many ways they are winning. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxfU_cvb658&t=165.52s)]
