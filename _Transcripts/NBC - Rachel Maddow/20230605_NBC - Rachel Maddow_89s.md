# Rachel Maddow announces new podcast series: 'Rachel Maddow Presents: Déjà News'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys)
*  I've got a new podcast that's about to come out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=0.0s)]
*  It's called Rachel Maddow Presents Deja News. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=4.16s)]
*  First episode comes out a week from tonight, next week, so I'll tell you more about it [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=7.76s)]
*  then. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=10.88s)]
*  But the trailer just came out today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=11.88s)]
*  It's out right now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=13.36s)]
*  If you want to check out the trailer, you could follow the show for free so you can [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=14.36s)]
*  get the new episodes when they come out. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=17.52s)]
*  You can do all of that at MSNBC.com slash Deja News. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=19.48s)]
*  Again, it's just the trailer that's out now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=23.84s)]
*  The episode number one comes out next week. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=26.32s)]
*  But the basic idea of this new podcast is that, deja vu all over again, kind of. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=30.48s)]
*  The basic idea is that we keep having things happen in the news that seem totally unprecedented, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=38.08s)]
*  that seem bizarre and new and out of the blue. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  But in fact, there is precedent. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=47.8s)]
*  There is something else like this that has happened before. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=49.6s)]
*  And maybe learning about that historical precedent can help us better understand what [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=52.36s)]
*  otherwise feels overwhelming or super unfamiliar in today's news. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=56.2s)]
*  That's the basic idea of this Rachel Maddow Presents Deja News podcast, which again, is [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  sort of just launching today. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_GpIODQSys&t=67.04s)]
