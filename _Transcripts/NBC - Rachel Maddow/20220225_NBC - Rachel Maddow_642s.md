Video Description: Rachel Maddow outlines the poor job Vladimir Putin has done governing Russia and makes the case that part of Putin's motivation for sabotaging democracy in neighboring countries as well as in more distant Western countries is to discourage Russians from realizing how much better their lives could be if they weren't ruled by a thieving dictator.

# Putin's Failure As A Leader Drives His Resentment Of Ukraine Democracy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw)
*  So if you take the Earth as a whole, if you look at all of the land on Earth, it is worth [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=0.0s)]
*  remembering that more than 10% of all the land on Earth is Russia. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=8.3s)]
*  Russia is enormous. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=15.82s)]
*  It is physically enormous, physically the largest nation on Earth, and it's not even [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=17.48s)]
*  close. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=21.56s)]
*  Russia is more than six and a half million square miles of land, more than six and a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=22.56s)]
*  half million. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=27.060000000000002s)]
*  No other country on Earth is more than four million square miles. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=28.06s)]
*  It's just massive. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=32.68s)]
*  I mean, we're a big country, too. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=33.68s)]
*  We have, you know, four time zones coast to coast. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=36.6s)]
*  Russia has 11 time zones. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=39.14s)]
*  And yet, despite that massive size, Russia has a teeny tiny little sclerotic backwards [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=42.019999999999996s)]
*  economy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=47.66s)]
*  They're the biggest country on Earth. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=48.66s)]
*  They've got an economy considerably smaller than Italy's. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  In terms of population, nominal GDP per capita, Russia's not just worse off than like us [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=55.42s)]
*  or Italy or any other country in Western Europe. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  Russia is way below like Romania, way below Panama. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=64.26s)]
*  They're economically worse off than the Maldives and Palau. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=68.8s)]
*  Per capita GDP. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=74.4s)]
*  And you know, yes, Russia has had the luck to be sitting on lots of oil and gas. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=76.92s)]
*  They have a totally non-competitive, unmodernized, technologically backward oil and gas industry [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=83.14s)]
*  to show for it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=88.5s)]
*  But that's really all they have in terms of an economy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=90.08s)]
*  I mean, literally, their entire economic output is oil and gas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=92.66s)]
*  And even so, their oil and gas sector is so lame that whenever they want to do something [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=97.38s)]
*  more complicated than sticking a straw into the ground in Siberia, they have to find some [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  Western oil company to come in and build the technology for them to do it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=106.86s)]
*  The one thing they have, they barely even have. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=111.94s)]
*  Russia is a country with immense resources. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=115.02s)]
*  And the Russian people have a record of cultural and scientific achievement that any country [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=118.08s)]
*  on earth would kill for. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=122.2s)]
*  And yet, their leaders have taken that potential and just shredded it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=124.94s)]
*  Russia, under its current leadership, has devolved into a kleptocratic dictatorship [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=132.82s)]
*  where, yes, you know, technically there's a parliament, there's the Russian Duma, but [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=138.02s)]
*  really exists in name only. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=142.86s)]
*  It's just basically an extension of Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=144.74s)]
*  And yes, technically there is a judiciary in Russia, but also in name only. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  It is also just an extension of Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  And yes, technically, barely, but technically there are elections in Russia, but that fiction [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  doesn't even really extend to in name only at this point, since Putin now just declares [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=160.58s)]
*  opposition candidacies and opposition parties to be illegal. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=165.5s)]
*  So the people of Russia today are remarkably ill served by their increasingly isolated [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=171.78s)]
*  aging dictator who has over 20 years in power under his belt already. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=180.02s)]
*  He's got plans for 20 more. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=184.82s)]
*  He has no plan for a successor and apparently no plan to release Russia from the suffocating [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=186.46s)]
*  hold that he has on that beleaguered country and the fates of its 144 million people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=192.46s)]
*  He has reduced his country to one that exports. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=199.5s)]
*  I said they only have one export. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=202.78s)]
*  Really, they have two. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=204.06s)]
*  They export oil and gas and they export organized crime. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=205.1s)]
*  Great. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=208.38s)]
*  And now with each passing year, the world becomes increasingly capable of saying no, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=209.7s)]
*  at least to the oil and gas that he's selling. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  So what does he have left? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=218.74s)]
*  What else can he do? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=221.02s)]
*  For months now, the United States has been warning overtly publicly that Russian President [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Putin was massing all those troops on the Ukrainian border for a reason that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  it wasn't for military exercises and it wasn't for any other reason. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=233.62s)]
*  He was planning to invade. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=237.18s)]
*  He was not only planning to invade, he was planning a large scale invasion, a full scale [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=239.10000000000002s)]
*  invasion with the aim of taking over Ukraine. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=243.5s)]
*  The United States has been warning about that explicitly for months. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=248.62s)]
*  Also for months, Russia has been denying it, denying they would ever even consider such [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=251.78s)]
*  a thing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  The ambassador denying it, the foreign minister denying it, members of the Russian Duma denying [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=256.7s)]
*  it, presenters on Russian state-run television denying it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  Oh, how ridiculous for the United States to say such a provocative thing that we plan [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=264.02000000000004s)]
*  to invade Ukraine. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=268.66s)]
*  How ridiculous, how hilarious. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=270.54s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=272.02000000000004s)]
*  You can put that in your file to refer to if you ever forget in the future whether or [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=274.68s)]
*  not Russian government pronouncements should be taken as if they mean something. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=278.3s)]
*  They spent months denying this would happen and now of course it has happened. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=282.22s)]
*  The US government even publicly released intelligence about what kinds of false pretexts, what kind [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  of fake stories Russia was planning to make up about Ukraine to create a fake justification [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  for why they needed to invade. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=300.18s)]
*  The United States said in advance, hey, Russia is going to make up some fake nonsense about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  there being mistreatment of Russian speaking people in eastern Ukraine. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=306.54s)]
*  They're going to make up something about that, about how they need to send in troops to rescue [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=310.46s)]
*  all these people who are being victimized somehow because the Ukrainian government is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=314.42s)]
*  hurting its citizens somehow. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=318.1s)]
*  The US government warned in advance that this is what Russia would make up, that this is [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=320.46s)]
*  what they would claim to purportedly justify their invasion. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=324.42s)]
*  And then sure enough, like clockwork, that is exactly what Russia did. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=328.82s)]
*  They announced war on Ukraine saying that Russian troops were only entering because [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=332.88s)]
*  they needed to, it was forced upon them, they needed to step in as peacekeepers to stop [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=337.36s)]
*  some mythical crimes being committed by the Ukrainian government against Russian speaking [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=342.0s)]
*  Ukrainians in the eastern part of that country. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=346.58s)]
*  It is a baldly false pretext and it is one that we knew to expect. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=349.8s)]
*  It's not the real reason Putin invaded. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=357.44s)]
*  Why did Putin invade? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=360.92s)]
*  Why is he doing this? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=362.54s)]
*  Why is this happening? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=363.54s)]
*  Well if you were the kleptocratic dictator sitting on top of a country that you were [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=367.26000000000005s)]
*  keeping poor and unhappy and backward with no plans to do anything but more of that for [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=370.62s)]
*  another few decades, how would you feel about a big culturally similar neighboring country [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=375.0s)]
*  where your population and their population had lots of family ties, lots of connection, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=383.88s)]
*  lots of reason to identify with one another. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=388.88s)]
*  And in that large, culturally similar neighboring country, they recently threw out the pro-Russia [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=391.2s)]
*  puppet leader that you had installed there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  They took economic steps to ally themselves with Europe more than with you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=401.18s)]
*  They then elected by a huge margin a popular Russian speaking guy who wants ties with the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=405.26s)]
*  West and Europe and the United States, a new young charismatic leader who said the night [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=410.44s)]
*  he was elected that everybody in the former Soviet states should look at his election [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=415.34s)]
*  and know that anything is possible, that anything is possible even in the former Soviet world [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=419.42s)]
*  thanks to democracy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=425.38s)]
*  How does that look to you if you're Vladimir Putin? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=429.86s)]
*  From the corner that Vladimir Putin has painted himself into, in the country he has ruined, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=433.86s)]
*  the threat posed by a free, democratic, Western minded, modern Ukraine. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=440.42s)]
*  That's like a skeleton hand that might grab you by the ankle if you let your foot drift [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=447.5s)]
*  too far off the edge of the bed at night. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=451.42s)]
*  Yes, it's true, Russian President Vladimir Putin has delusions about being a new czar [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=454.46000000000004s)]
*  and remaking the Russian Empire and reconstituting the USSR, sure. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=461.94s)]
*  Fine. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=466.94s)]
*  But also, outside of the fairy tale books, he also just can't let any country near him [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=468.22s)]
*  work in a way that might indicate to the Russian people that they too ought to expect their [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=475.5s)]
*  country and their government to work for them. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=481.86s)]
*  He needs his neighboring countries to be dependent on him, to be corrupt, and to be fundamentally [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=484.46000000000004s)]
*  disappointing to their people. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=490.02000000000004s)]
*  That's what he needs from the near abroad, from his neighboring countries and from the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  far abroad. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=497.3s)]
*  For us in the West, he would please prefer us to be disunified, destabilized, and as [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=498.3s)]
*  disreputable as he can possibly make us. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=503.66s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason why Russia has been spending all of this time not only trying [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=505.7s)]
*  to upend the international Western led order, but he's specifically spending all of this [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG9pxkZXiTw&t=509.62s)]
