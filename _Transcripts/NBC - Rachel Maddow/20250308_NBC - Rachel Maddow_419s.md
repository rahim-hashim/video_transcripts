Video Description: As Donald Trump guts the programs and agencies behind some of America's greatest scientific achievements and fires the people responsible for those achievements and working on new ones, scientists across the country from every discipline took to the streets in protest to "stand up for science." 

Update: After Trump’s address to Congress, the White House pushed back on the idea that the president errantly referred to “making mice transgender” when some people suggested he may have meant transgenic instead. The White House insists the president was referring to “transgender experiments on mice.”

# American scientists take to the streets to protest Trump's cuts
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE)
*  I love days like this. I love news days like this. There's so much to show you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania today. People turned out to stand up for science. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=5.0s)]
*  That was the name of the protest, to protest against the Trump administration's indiscriminate cuts to science in all ways. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=10.0s)]
*  You can see some of the signs here. Fight for science. Defend the NIH. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=17.0s)]
*  Defunding research is a recession plan. That's actually quite true. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=24.0s)]
*  Here's a good one. Quote, budget cuts create all kinds of trouble. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=28.0s)]
*  I had to look that up. Alkynes, A-L-K-Y-N-E-S, alkynes are organic molecules made of the functional group carbon-carbon triple bonds. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=33.0s)]
*  They are unsaturated hydrocarbons. And budget cuts create all kinds of trouble. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=44.0s)]
*  Here's another good one. In Pittsburgh, got polio? No? Thanks, science. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=51.0s)]
*  And see where it says it's a Berg thing and the Salk vaccine there. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=59.0s)]
*  The University of Pittsburgh is where Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=63.0s)]
*  Across the state of Pennsylvania, outside City Hall in Philadelphia, look at this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=67.0s)]
*  This was the stand-up for science crowd outside Philly City Hall today. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=72.0s)]
*  Look at that. That's a really big protest. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=79.0s)]
*  Some good signs at the Philly protest as well. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=83.0s)]
*  Your policy, defund the NIH, has been rejected by peer review. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=86.0s)]
*  This is a good one. I feel like this one is special for Susan's birthday today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=92.0s)]
*  She loves beaker from the Muppets. Susan, this happened in Philly today. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=96.0s)]
*  This is the only orange Muppet I trust to tell me about science. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=101.0s)]
*  A version of this sign we saw a few different places today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=106.0s)]
*  I love trans mice. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=112.0s)]
*  All right. I know you didn't listen to Trump's speech to Congress this week. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=115.0s)]
*  I saw the numbers. It was the least watched Trump State of the Union or joint speech to Congress of all the ones he's given. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=118.0s)]
*  I know you didn't watch. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=128.0s)]
*  One of the things he said in his speech was that one of the terrible liberal things that his top campaign donor had discovered was happening in government was research to make mice transgender. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=129.0s)]
*  He said that in his speech and all the Republicans gasped and laughed and jeered because that was so terrible. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=145.0s)]
*  Actually, it's transgenic mice and transgenic mice are used in all kinds of laboratory research because mice are transgenic when they have been genetically altered so you can study human illnesses and conditions in them even though they're mice. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=152.0s)]
*  It is transgenic mice. You numbskulls. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=169.0s)]
*  But sure, go ahead and shut down all the labs studying all the diseases because what are you, five? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=175.0s)]
*  This was Boston. There were big crowds today in Boston as well. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=181.0s)]
*  Stand up for science. Some signs in Boston. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=188.0s)]
*  No science means no medicine, no tech, no progress, no future. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=191.0s)]
*  Also, this one cut DNA, not the NIH, genetics research and experimentation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=195.0s)]
*  Of course, because it's Boston, there's a Dunkin Donut sign. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=204.0s)]
*  America runs on science. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=207.0s)]
*  In Madison, Wisconsin, local public radio there put the turnout at what they described as more than a thousand at the stand up for science protest at the Wisconsin state Capitol. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=210.0s)]
*  Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wickler said he was there and he thought the crowd was even larger than that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=220.0s)]
*  He also singled out his favorite sign in Madison, which was, quote, no science, no cheese. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=225.0s)]
*  It's Wisconsin. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=232.0s)]
*  Really, really big crowd turned out in New York City at Washington Square Park to protest against Trump's cuts to science. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=234.0s)]
*  Look at that. Cold day, cold, windy day today in New York City. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=242.0s)]
*  Nine out of 10 preventable diseases prefer the GOP. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=247.0s)]
*  Every disaster movie begins with a politician ignoring science. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=250.0s)]
*  See the one on the left there? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=256.0s)]
*  It was a cold, miserable Chicago winter day today in the Windy City, but people turned out in big numbers in Chicago as well to protest. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=258.0s)]
*  In addition to all the scientists and supporters and regular people who showed up, they also got some high level representation from their members of Congress, including Senator Dick Durbin and Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=269.0s)]
*  In Atlanta, there were big crowds in Atlanta at Liberty Plaza. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=281.0s)]
*  Atlanta, of course, is home to the CDC, which Trump has whacked with big cuts and huge numbers of firings. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=286.0s)]
*  People turned out in the South and Little Rock, Arkansas, on the state Capitol steps. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=292.0s)]
*  Stand up for science. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=297.0s)]
*  People turned out in Lansing, Michigan, with signs supporting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=299.0s)]
*  We love Noah, so stop firing the darn meteorologists and the people who run the freaking weather radar. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=307.0s)]
*  People turned out in St. Louis, Missouri, which is a good science sign. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=313.0s)]
*  Time to react with the steaming beaker. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=318.0s)]
*  Raleigh, North Carolina, part of what they love to call the research triangle. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=322.0s)]
*  But here are researchers and scientists and their supporters and regular folks having to come out in Raleigh, North Carolina today, protesting against Donald Trump's massive cuts to scientific research. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=326.0s)]
*  The biggest protest today was in Washington, D.C. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=338.0s)]
*  Literally thousands of people turned out to stand up for science and protest against Trump today. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=341.0s)]
*  Really big turnout in Washington. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=347.0s)]
*  Signs there include these. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=349.0s)]
*  Science is not a liberal conspiracy. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=351.0s)]
*  Funds science save lives. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=355.0s)]
*  Doge doesn't pass peer review. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=358.0s)]
*  Also this one, very simply, cancer is not a partisan issue. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=361.0s)]
*  This is a nice subtle one. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=366.0s)]
*  Hello, Health and Human Services Secretary. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=368.0s)]
*  Quote, science prevents brain worms. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=370.0s)]
*  Stand up for science protests happened all over the country today. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=376.0s)]
*  And this was a big national organizing effort that was led by a small cadre of people just directly affected by these cuts. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=379.0s)]
*  Graduate students and doctoral candidates and young scientists called this march today in Washington. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=387.0s)]
*  And then soon dozens of satellite marches sprung up all around the country. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=393.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA9-MPECyYE&t=409.0s)]
