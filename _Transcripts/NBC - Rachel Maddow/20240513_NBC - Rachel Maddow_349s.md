# 'Most like a criminal': Bad day in court for Trump as Cohen testimony outlines cover-up
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c)
*  Ari, in terms of looking ahead to that cross, I was interested in your special coverage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=0.0s)]
*  today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=5.08s)]
*  You had a guest on who was very bullish on the defense and said that Michael Cohen is [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=6.08s)]
*  going to get destroyed on cross-examination. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=12.44s)]
*  He also repeatedly called you Ari, including at the end saying in a very performative way, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  hasta la vista, Ari. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=19.64s)]
*  And I was like, is he actually trying to start a fight with Ari right here? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=20.64s)]
*  Is this going to be a fisticuffs moment on MSNBC? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=24.48s)]
*  So, Ari, it was a weird thing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=27.76s)]
*  Looking ahead toward that cross-examination, do you feel like Michael Cohen has a glass [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=32.52s)]
*  jaw here that he has shown himself to be vulnerable in a way that is inviting a real beating [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=37.24s)]
*  from the defense? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=42.900000000000006s)]
*  Not glass, but maybe recently smelt clay. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  He has some holes, and I think they will get to that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=50.160000000000004s)]
*  And the lawyer you mentioned defended Donald Trump at the second impeachment, which if [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=52.52s)]
*  you're picking is the worst one. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=56.76s)]
*  So that's where he's coming from, although I was happy to get his views because it's [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=58.6s)]
*  interesting, but that's the perspective. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  I think the issue for Michael Cohen on cross will be overall credibility because they will [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=63.16s)]
*  get into the criminal record and the story did change. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=69.08s)]
*  And then raising doubt that he might have gone rogue, the he went rogue story is farfetched. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=71.88s)]
*  But they don't need to prove it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=78.6s)]
*  They just need to raise the doubt that it could be true. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=79.8s)]
*  I did think to echo what we were just discussing, there have been days where defendant Trump [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=82.08s)]
*  looked unseemly, certainly did not look relatable, looked untrustworthy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=86.56s)]
*  I thought today Michael Cohen and the way they did this testimony, this is the day that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=91.42s)]
*  Donald Trump looked most like a criminal. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=96.18s)]
*  I thought it was a very bad day for him because his own lawyer, who famously went to prison, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  very clearly provided the timeline of a proactive plan to allegedly commit a crime. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=103.48s)]
*  It sounded familiar to because we've had all these other witnesses come in and I thought [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=109.76s)]
*  that's what was effective today. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  Most of the things he said, the jury's heard it before. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=115.92s)]
*  They've heard a piece of it here and there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=118.76s)]
*  And I thought that's what I thought was effective about today's testimony. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=120.68s)]
*  It's not him going rogue. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=124.12s)]
*  Katie, let me ask you a piece of this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=125.12s)]
*  Just as a lawyer looking at the way the prosecution is making this case, one of the things that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=128.16s)]
*  we got today over and over and over again, as Suzanne was saying, some of this stuff [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=131.8s)]
*  was familiar was Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=135.16s)]
*  And so we got that a whole bunch of different ways. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=138.32s)]
*  We got that Michael Cohen was first hired as a lawyer at the Trump organization. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=140.56s)]
*  After he was working for another law firm, submitted a bill for $100,000 for that legal [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=145.72s)]
*  fees, those legal fees, and Trump didn't want to pay them and said, I'm not going to pay [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=150.72s)]
*  that bill. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  You come work for me instead. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  Michael Cohen never goes back to his office. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=156.6s)]
*  They send Trump organization employees to go clean out that office and the bill disappears [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=158.4s)]
*  and Michael Cohen becomes his employee. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=162.4s)]
*  Michael Cohen's first big coup working as Trump's lawyer is stiffing the vendors and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=164.6s)]
*  suppliers to Trump University. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=169.8s)]
*  Michael Cohen almost loses the Karen McDougall hush money arrangement because they don't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=171.8s)]
*  want to pay Karen McDougall. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=177.68s)]
*  Michael Cohen almost loses the Stormy Daniels hush money arrangement because they don't [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=179.84s)]
*  want to pay Stormy Daniels. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=183.32000000000002s)]
*  Michael Cohen ultimately gets back some of his money that he paid to a technical services [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=185.12s)]
*  firm in his final payments because that firm was also stiffed by my- [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=191.56s)]
*  Two years prior. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Two years prior by Donald Trump. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  We get the recording that was played for the jury because Michael Cohen has to cover up [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=199.76s)]
*  for Donald Trump's stiffing AMI on the payment for Karen McDougall and so he's making the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=205.16s)]
*  recording to assure AMI eventually will pay you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=210.76s)]
*  I mean, all of these things are a cascading series of screwing people, for lack of a better [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=214.2s)]
*  term, in terms of their bills. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=222.48s)]
*  Why are they giving us that as a pattern? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=224.04s)]
*  Because it speaks to the Ebenezer Scrooge energy of Donald Trump. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=227.8s)]
*  But why is that bad for the defense? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=231.56s)]
*  Why is that good for the prosecution? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  It's good for the prosecution because it feeds into the concept of the evidence which says [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  that Donald Trump is a penny-pinching, miserly person who will always count his pennies. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  To Chris's point earlier about the fact that you cannot present a $420,000 approved invoice [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  for essential consultants, LLC, a la Michael Cohen, when all he did was front $130,000. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=250.36s)]
*  But what you just did right now, and you could just get up and do closings at this [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=257.08s)]
*  point, Rachel, you proved how effective Michael Cohen is. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=260.47999999999996s)]
*  Think about this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=265.28s)]
*  Donald Trump always said famously, where's my Roy Cohn? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=266.28s)]
*  There's a reason why he wanted Roy Cohn. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  Roy Cohn was indicted four times. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=271.52s)]
*  Roy Cohn also represented John Gotti. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=273.56s)]
*  If Michael Cohen was so bad at his job, Trump wouldn't have ever kept him around. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=277.52s)]
*  And because of the effectiveness of him dealing with the cheapness of Donald Trump, Donald [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=282.28s)]
*  Trump kept Michael Cohen. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's the reason why Donald Trump never wanted a good attorney. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  He wanted a flawed attorney. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=293.96s)]
*  He saw that in Michael Cohen. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  He tested Michael Cohen with that bill from Michael Cohen's original law firm. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=297.78s)]
*  And when he stiffed Michael Cohen's original law firm and Cohen jumped at the opportunity, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=301.85999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump said, here's my new Roy Cohn. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=306.32s)]
*  They're saying Donald Trump wouldn't pay $400,000 unless he authorized it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=309.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=314.88s)]
*  Right, because the defense is going to be Cohen and Weisselberg went rogue and he didn't [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=315.88s)]
*  ... this is a big ... this penny-pinching thing is going to come up, was he or not, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=319.24s)]
*  because the defense is, I think their main thing is going to be those two went rogue. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=323.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  And he was just ... he didn't see it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy6OiFDXB6c&t=328.40000000000003s)]
