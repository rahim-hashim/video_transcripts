# Report Of Massive Saudi Payout To Kushner Raises New Questions About Trump Admin Policies
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40)
*  I bet you remember this photo, this crazy photo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=0.0s)]
*  This photo—remember this?—this photo was taken on Donald Trump's very first foreign [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=4.32s)]
*  trip of his presidency. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=9.8s)]
*  His first foreign trip was to Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=12.36s)]
*  That's the king of Saudi Arabia in the middle there, the guy in yellow who looks surprised. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=14.44s)]
*  Again, this was Trump's very first foreign visit as president. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=19.04s)]
*  No other American president ever made Saudi Arabia their first foreign trip, but Trump [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  did. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=27.36s)]
*  And that kind of set the tone for a lot of really unusual favors and special treatment [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=29.16s)]
*  for Saudi Arabia during Trump's one beleaguered term in office. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=33.6s)]
*  Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner was at the helm of most of those decisions, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=38.76s)]
*  most of that special treatment. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=44.56s)]
*  Mr. Kushner himself made at least three trips to Saudi Arabia just during Trump's first [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  year in office. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  And I say it was at least three because we don't know about all his trips, maybe. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  Of those three, one of them, Kushner flew there secretly. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=56.88s)]
*  We didn't learn about it until after he was back, long after it was over. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=60.0s)]
*  That was the trip that reportedly included several nights where Jared Kushner and the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=64.04s)]
*  crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman—he goes by MBS—Jarred and MBS reportedly [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  stayed up till four in the morning, swapping stories and planning strategy, end quote. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  Shortly after Jared Kushner got back from that trip, the Saudi crown prince, MBS, rounded [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=80.28s)]
*  up literally hundreds of members of the royal family and other rich Saudis and basically [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=85.96s)]
*  jailed them, including torturing some of them, in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh until [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  lots of them were forced to give up billions of dollars and any claims to power they might [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  have. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=100.44s)]
*  And MBS didn't just have tacit support from the Trump White House for that bizarre crackdown. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  President Trump explicitly tweeted his approval of it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  Trump also incredibly supported Saudi Arabia's weird economic blockade of their neighbor, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=111.12s)]
*  Qatar. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  Even though Qatar is a staunch US ally and they host a gigantic US military base that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  houses 10,000 American troops, Saudi Arabia launched this big blockade of Qatar and Trump [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=123.12s)]
*  said, okay, I'm on the Saudi side. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=128.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=131.36s)]
*  Trump even bent over backwards to prevent Saudi Arabia's crown prince after the murder [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=132.8s)]
*  and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, an operation that US intelligence [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  concluded was personally approved by MBS himself. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=143.28s)]
*  Trump later told journalist Bob Woodward about MBS, quote, I saved his bass. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=147.32s)]
*  Quote, I was able to get Congress to leave him alone. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=153.56s)]
*  I was able to get them to stop. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=157.16s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=159.68s)]
*  Why did you do that? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  It was so strange and so blatant. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  Why are why is the United States government doing this? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=164.68s)]
*  Why is our government going out of their way? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=167.52s)]
*  Not just to excuse and paper over, but to really prop up this guy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  How does this work? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=173.4s)]
*  While the Trump administration was giving the Saudi crown prince everything he wanted [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=176.4s)]
*  and more Trump's Treasury Secretary, the guy in charge of money for the Trump administration, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=179.82000000000002s)]
*  Steven Mnuchin, he kept making ever more frequent trips to go see MBS even after the Jamal Khashoggi [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=186.24s)]
*  murder. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=193.12s)]
*  In fact, in the very last days of the Trump administration, Mnuchin took it took one last [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=194.12s)]
*  taxpayer funded overseas junket to go visit Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=198.6s)]
*  He had to cut that trip short because of the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=202.68s)]
*  but not too short. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=207.76s)]
*  Even after that, he stretched it out a couple more days because he wanted to squeeze in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=209.16s)]
*  one last meeting with MBS. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=212.24s)]
*  Well, now we know just how well all that hard work paid off. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=215.52s)]
*  The New York Times is reporting now that just six months after Trump left office, Saudi [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=219.4s)]
*  Arabia gave Steven Mnuchin a billion dollars. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=223.86s)]
*  Saudi Arabia put a billion dollars into a brand new investment fund created by Mr. Mnuchin. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=227.86s)]
*  That money came out of a Saudi government fund controlled by MBS. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=234.54000000000002s)]
*  I mean, services rendered, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=238.34s)]
*  A billion dollars for a job well done when you were a public official serving in the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=241.94000000000003s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=246.74s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=247.74s)]
*  Steven Mnuchin, the money guy from Trump's cabinet. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=249.66s)]
*  Yes, he got a billion dollars from the Saudis six months after leaving office. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=252.06s)]
*  But we now know that at about the same time, the Saudis gave two billion dollars to Jared [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=257.3s)]
*  to Trump's son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=265.34s)]
*  According to this new reporting from the New York Times, MBS gave this two billion dollars [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=269.02s)]
*  to Jared Kushner's new investment venture. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  Despite all the advisors for the Saudi sovereign wealth fund advising against giving Jared [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=278.58s)]
*  the money, the Saudi advisors who oversee the fund looked at Jared's proposal and, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=283.7s)]
*  according to internal documents obtained by the New York Times, their response was basically, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=288.5s)]
*  yeah, why would we invest in this? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=292.7s)]
*  Jared Kushner has no experience in this kind of investing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  None. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=299.94s)]
*  Also, there are no other investors in this thing at all besides us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=300.94s)]
*  And our due diligence on their operations, quote, shows that they are unsatisfactory [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=306.42s)]
*  in all aspects. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=312.98s)]
*  In all aspects. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=315.26s)]
*  That said, MBS staffers at the Saudi fund told these advisors, don't worry, we've told [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=318.58000000000004s)]
*  them that after the first five hundred million dollars, they really, really have to hire [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=324.14s)]
*  some people who know what they're doing before they get the other billion and a half. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=329.18s)]
*  You know, after that, you know, fingers crossed, they'll figure out how to manage the other [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=334.82s)]
*  1.5 billion dollars we're giving them. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  But we'll condition the first five hundred million on them actually setting up a company [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=341.18s)]
*  that hires some people who know how to do what Jared is asking us for this money for. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, at least with Steven Mnuchin, he was technically an investor. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=351.38s)]
*  He had been the Treasury Secretary. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=356.38s)]
*  I mean, he had a money shaped hole in which you could insert a billion dollars, right? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=358.1s)]
*  He was like a money guy. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=362.94s)]
*  But Jared Kushner. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=364.46s)]
*  He ran his dad's real estate firm for a while when it got into money trouble. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=366.7s)]
*  I mean, with Mnuchin, the deal still stinks to high heaven. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=371.65999999999997s)]
*  But on paper, at least he kind of makes sense as a place for the Saudi government to park [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=375.18s)]
*  some money, maybe the Saudi government, though, then gave Jared Kushner twice as much money [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  on more favorable terms on the vague hope that Jared will eventually hire people to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=385.82s)]
*  do the actual work of, you know, managing their investment. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=390.54s)]
*  Why was Jared worth twice as much as the billion dollars they gave Mnuchin? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=396.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, presumably in his case, it's not just services rendered, but services to be rendered. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=401.62s)]
*  There's always the prospect that Donald Trump might be president again. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=407.54s)]
*  Who knows if Trump would pick the same cabinet secretaries again? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=411.06s)]
*  Who knows if Steven Mnuchin would get the job back again? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=413.98s)]
*  But he'll presumably have the same son-in-law. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=416.38s)]
*  So maybe it's payment for services rendered and also services to come. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=418.66s)]
*  When one of the skeptical Saudi advisors asked why they couldn't at least cut back the amount [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=423.98s)]
*  they were giving Jared, MBS's staff replied that the whole point was to, quote, form a [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=428.02000000000004s)]
*  strategic relationship with this new fund and its founder, Jared Kushner. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=432.3s)]
*  And cutting back the two billion dollar stake they were giving him could screw that up. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=436.90000000000003s)]
*  The Saudi government under MBS giving Jared Kushner two billion dollars really does look [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=444.1s)]
*  like not just payment for services rendered, but also a down payment for services expected. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=450.70000000000005s)]
*  If you had to explain corruption, if you had to explain being compromised by a foreign [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=456.70000000000005s)]
*  power to like a seven year old, this would be a good coloring book to start with. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=461.86s)]
*  What are we as a country supposed to do about a situation like this? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLTvEPile40&t=467.96000000000004s)]
