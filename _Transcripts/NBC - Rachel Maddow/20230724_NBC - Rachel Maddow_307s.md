# Trump court schedule puts rule of law on the ballot; Alabama GOP already rejecting courts
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw)
*  Alabama's legislature appears poised to do something very, very radical, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=0.0s)]
*  to make sure that black voters in Alabama cannot elect representatives of their choice. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=4.8s)]
*  You may have heard, the Supreme Court of the United States, this may have crossed your radar. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=11.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court of the United States, you might know, right now is a very conservative body. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=18.0s)]
*  A 6-3 hard-right conservative majority on the nation's highest court as we speak. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=24.0s)]
*  But even so, even that hard-line conservative 6-3 court could not swallow the recent decision [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=32.0s)]
*  by Alabama's legislature to draw up congressional districts in that state. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=40.0s)]
*  So there's only one black majority district in the whole state, in a state where a quarter of the population is black. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=45.0s)]
*  The high court ordered the state of Alabama to make a new map, where there are two such districts [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=52.0s)]
*  where black voters might be able to elect a representative of their choice. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=60.0s)]
*  They have been ordered to do this by the federal courts. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=64.0s)]
*  Alabama is refusing to do it, even though Alabama technically is a state in the United States of America, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=67.0s)]
*  which is a country that is technically subject to the rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=76.0s)]
*  Even the Alabama parts of the United States are subject to federal court orders. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=81.0s)]
*  But apparently they're deciding on this issue that they maybe don't want to be. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=86.0s)]
*  Alabama deciding it just might not follow federal court orders when it comes to black people voting in 2023, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=91.0s)]
*  it's not like a rascally little tantrum that Alabama is throwing here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=99.0s)]
*  This is the whole point of the country kind of stuff. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=106.0s)]
*  This is as serious as it gets. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=109.0s)]
*  I mean, defying federal court orders to state the obvious, that is a fast drive down a short road for any country. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=111.0s)]
*  And any state in the Deep South, any state that succeeded during the Civil War, is very, very well aware of that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=117.0s)]
*  They are very well aware of how radical this is. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=124.0s)]
*  But of course, it's even more resonant. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=127.0s)]
*  It's even more incendiary to do it right now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=129.0s)]
*  Because Governor slavery was not that bad. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=134.0s)]
*  DeSantis really does not look like he's going to go the distance in the Republican nominating contest. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=138.0s)]
*  He's just running a terrible, terrible campaign that's sort of getting worse and more expensive by the day. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=144.0s)]
*  He seems to be the only person who ever had a prayer of being within shooting distance, proverbial shooting distance, forgive me, of the Republican frontrunner. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=153.0s)]
*  I mean, the Republican Party really does poised, does look poised to renominate its frontrunner, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=162.0s)]
*  to renominate the candidate who is dominating all their presidential polling by 20, 30, 40 points. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=169.0s)]
*  And if nobody can get anywhere near him, if they do renominate Donald Trump as their candidate for president, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=175.0s)]
*  that means the whole campaign for president, the whole election for president of the United States over the course of this next year, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=181.0s)]
*  is going to be in large part a referendum on this question of whether we follow court orders anymore as a country, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=188.0s)]
*  whether the legal system binds us, whether it binds all of us. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=198.0s)]
*  Because the likely Republican nominee for president, as things are going, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=202.0s)]
*  the prohibitive favorite to be the Republican nominee for president, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=206.0s)]
*  he is facing a trial in October on a quarter billion dollar civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=210.0s)]
*  then another civil trial in January on defamation claims related to sexual assault allegations against him, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=217.0s)]
*  then another civil trial later in January on a multimillion dollar civil fraud case related to an alleged pyramid scheme type thing that he was involved in, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=223.0s)]
*  then a criminal trial in March on the New York state hush money charges, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=231.0s)]
*  then a federal criminal trial in May on his federal felony criminal indictment for his handling of classified documents, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=235.0s)]
*  and meanwhile we're waiting on news of additional potential criminal indictments of him personally, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=241.0s)]
*  both at the federal level and in the state of Georgia related to his efforts to overthrow the government and stay in power after he lost reelection. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=246.0s)]
*  So if that's the, you know, personal schedule of the Republican party nominee for president, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=253.0s)]
*  A, busy, and B, the election is going to be about this. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=259.0s)]
*  It's going to be the referendum question posed both implicitly and explicitly by his candidacy. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=264.0s)]
*  Do we choose him or do we choose law? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=271.0s)]
*  Do we choose the law? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=274.0s)]
*  Does the law apply to us all? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=276.0s)]
*  Does it protect us all? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=278.0s)]
*  Does it constrain us all? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=279.0s)]
*  Or do we want this guy instead? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=281.0s)]
*  And all of the myriad things he has to offer. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kvor7iTAzw&t=283.0s)]
