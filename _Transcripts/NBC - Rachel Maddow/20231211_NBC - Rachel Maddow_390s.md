# 'The need for speed': Jack Smith adds specialist to shortcut Trump delay tactic
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus)
*  So broadly speaking, former President Donald Trump has followed two strategies as he defends [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=0.0s)]
*  himself against the 91 felony criminal charges he's facing right now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  His first strategy is delay, delay, delay, delay. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Delay it long enough, who knows, maybe Trump becomes president again in the middle of all [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=12.34s)]
*  this and somehow makes all the cases go away. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=15.58s)]
*  So that's his first and most important strategy, delay. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=18.66s)]
*  Second strategy is claim immunity. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=21.96s)]
*  Tell the courts that he can't be prosecuted because he was president at the time of his [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=24.88s)]
*  alleged crimes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=28.16s)]
*  Well today those two strategies came together in a surprising and urgent way. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=30.04s)]
*  The news comes from the criminal case against Trump that's pending in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=35.02s)]
*  federal court. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=38.76s)]
*  That's where Trump is now trying to make his immunity argument with a fresh appeal to the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=39.76s)]
*  federal appeals court in D.C., the D.C. circuit court of appeals just a few days ago. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=43.88s)]
*  Now the D.C. circuit court of appeals should be on your radar, in part because they spent [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  an entire year considering the single question of whether Trump could be held civilly liable [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=55.22s)]
*  for his behavior as president around the January 6th attack. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=62.22s)]
*  It took them ages and ages and ages to rule on that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=65.84s)]
*  11 months and 25 days. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=69.22s)]
*  They were really in no hurry. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=71.52s)]
*  And yes, they ruled that Trump could be held civilly liable. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=74.5s)]
*  It went against him, but it took them a year. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=76.98s)]
*  And remember, any delay is a win for Trump. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  So in the criminal case, a slow moving D.C. circuit court of appeals is a huge danger [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=82.54s)]
*  to the prospect of Trump actually getting into court and being tried anywhere near his [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  trial date, any time before the presidential election. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=91.26s)]
*  So this new move by special counsel Jack Smith today, he's decided to try to go around the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=95.62s)]
*  D.C. circuit court of appeals. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=100.54s)]
*  He petitioned the Supreme Court to just take the case directly, to hurry the process up, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=102.34s)]
*  to skip the appeals court in effect. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=106.98s)]
*  And this is one thing worth noting. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=110.34s)]
*  The petition to the Supreme Court was co-signed by this special counsel, counsel of record, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=111.56s)]
*  Michael Dreeben. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=117.68s)]
*  You recognize that name? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=118.68s)]
*  Michael Dreeben is a prosecutor served in the Solicitor General's Office at DOJ for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  over three decades. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  He has argued more than 100 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=126.68s)]
*  You can imagine why Jack Smith might have wanted to add this guy to this part of this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=130.88s)]
*  case. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=135.32s)]
*  Well, tonight, the Supreme Court has responded and said they're going to fast track consideration [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=136.32s)]
*  of whether or not to hear this case. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=141.12s)]
*  They've ordered Donald Trump to respond by next week, by Wednesday, December 20th. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=143.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Joyce Vance, former U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Alabama. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=147.2s)]
*  Joyce, it's great to see you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=150.44s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=151.92s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=154.84s)]
*  Did I understand that correctly? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=156.44s)]
*  Did I explain any of that the wrong way around? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=158.04s)]
*  No, I think you got it just right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=160.6s)]
*  Michael Dreeben is the former Deputy Solicitor General who had responsibility for criminal. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  That makes him a great pick for this case. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=168.68s)]
*  Now, Joyce, I know that you worked with Mr. Dreeben. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  You know him professionally from all your years in federal law enforcement. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=175.16s)]
*  What should we understand about him other than that line on his resume in terms of his [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=179.08s)]
*  skills, what he brings to this and why Jack Smith might be using him in this way for this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=183.6s)]
*  part of this case? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=188.72s)]
*  So, mere U.S. attorneys, the job that I once held, have to go to the Solicitor General [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=189.72s)]
*  anytime the government wants to take an appeal in a criminal case. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=196.06s)]
*  Dreeben was in charge of making those decisions, and that means he's considered every sort [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=200.18s)]
*  of criminal appellate situation that could come up. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=205.54s)]
*  This writ that you're talking about, Rachel, the writ for judgment before the Court of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=209.04s)]
*  Appeals has considered a case. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=213.3s)]
*  This isn't something that's commonly used. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=215.7s)]
*  It's not something that even appellate practitioners are widely familiar with. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=217.86s)]
*  This is the sort of strategy that you get when you come to someone like Dreeben. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=222.14s)]
*  And understanding that Trump's strategy is one of delay, you know, now this is Jack Smith's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=226.94s)]
*  moment where with his new appellate counsel at the table, he's saying, I feel the need [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=232.42s)]
*  for speed, and this is the way to get it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=237.05999999999997s)]
*  And Joyce, forgive me the ignorance that is at the heart of this question, but as a non-lawyer, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=240.26s)]
*  it's my impression that it only requires four of the nine justices to agree to this [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=246.54s)]
*  type of petition, to agree to consider this case. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=254.44s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  And why would they only need a minority? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=258.8s)]
*  Yes, you need four votes to hear the case. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=260.94s)]
*  This is pretty standard across appellate courts. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  It takes fewer votes to get a case heard than it takes to win it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=267.3s)]
*  So that's how the process is set up. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=271.34s)]
*  In terms of what's likely to happen here, if you had to, you know, looking at the composition [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=274.14s)]
*  of this court, looking at what we know about Smith's case, looking at Mr. Dreeben helming [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=281.5s)]
*  this part of the case, what do you expect to happen in the Supreme Court and over what [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=285.74s)]
*  kind of a timeframe? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=290.34s)]
*  So look, it's tough to predict these things. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=293.3s)]
*  We both know that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  But at bottom in this matter is Trump's argument that former presidents are above the law. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=297.86s)]
*  I don't think the Supreme Court can accept or let stand that sort of a ruling. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=303.82s)]
*  The Supreme Court has to decide this case. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=309.38s)]
*  It's what lawyers call an issue of first impression. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=311.85999999999996s)]
*  No court has ever determined whether a former president has immunity for the rest of his [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=314.41999999999996s)]
*  life for anything he did while he was president that might be criminal. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=319.02s)]
*  So there needs to be a decision. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=323.34s)]
*  But I think that there will be a majority of this court, even if it's a slender one, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  that will say that criminal prosecution can continue. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=329.85999999999996s)]
*  And the way we know that Dreeben is a great lawyer to argue this case is the way he's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=333.7s)]
*  framed this petition already, appealing to the core issues that we know this court is [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=338.34s)]
*  very concerned with. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=343.18s)]
*  The history, the structure, the language of the law is what he's already raised, saying [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=344.74s)]
*  that this is an issue that goes to the heart of democracy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=350.14s)]
*  It's fundamental to the future. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  I think he'll position this case to make it very attractive for the court to rule in Jack [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=355.58s)]
*  Smith's favor. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  Joyce Vance, thank you so much for joining us tonight. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=362.97999999999996s)]
*  Clarion, as always, it's great to have you here, Joyce. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=365.94s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pnh3flhqkus&t=368.62s)]
