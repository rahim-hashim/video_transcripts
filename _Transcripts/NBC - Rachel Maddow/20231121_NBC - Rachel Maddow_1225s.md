# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Nov. 20
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc)
*  In 2021, the Nobel Peace Prize was given to two journalists. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=0.0s)]
*  One of them was this man, the editor-in-chief of a newspaper called Novaya Gazeta. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=4.4s)]
*  Novaya Gazeta was probably the most important national newspaper in Russia that was independent [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=8.86s)]
*  and critical of the Kremlin. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=13.8s)]
*  Since Vladimir Putin's been the leader of Russia, at least six journalists from Novaya [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=15.88s)]
*  Gazeta have been murdered under mysterious circumstances, including their star investigative [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=20.06s)]
*  Anna Polikovskaya, who was murdered in her apartment building in 2006 on Vladimir Putin's birthday. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=25.56s)]
*  Novaya Gazeta's editor, Dmitry Muratov, was one of two people who was awarded the Nobel [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=32.56s)]
*  Peace Prize in 2021. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=39.44s)]
*  Shortly thereafter, under threat of having the whole staff of the newspaper arrested, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=40.92s)]
*  Novaya Gazeta was forced to stop its print edition and move its operations out of the country. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Just a few weeks ago, the editor himself, again, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=52.72s)]
*  officially declared a foreign agent in Russia. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=57.84s)]
*  He's not foreign, he's Russian. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=60.92s)]
*  But declaring him a foreign agent makes it essentially a crime for anybody in Russia [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=63.78s)]
*  to work with him in any way, and it likely means they will be trying to jail him as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=68.6s)]
*  I mentioned that he was one of two people that got the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=74.16s)]
*  The other person, the person he shared it with, is this journalist. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=78.16s)]
*  Her name is Maria Ressa. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=81.2s)]
*  Maria Ressa was raised in New Jersey. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=82.52s)]
*  She went to Princeton. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=84.92s)]
*  She's brilliant. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=85.92s)]
*  She was a bureau chief for CNN for a long time. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  Maria Ressa ended up founding an independent, modern, critical news organization in the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  Philippines called Rappler. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=93.04s)]
*  And when the Philippines got Rodrigo Duterte as the de facto dictator of that country, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  the same year that we got Donald Trump, soon after, Maria Ressa found herself arrested [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=103.62s)]
*  and jailed and charged with multiple crimes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=110.68s)]
*  She won that Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, along with the editor from Novaya Gazeta in Russia. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=113.64s)]
*  And soon after she won the Nobel Peace Prize, the Philippine government ordered Rappler, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=120.28s)]
*  her news organization, shut down entirely. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=125.48s)]
*  They are still fighting to keep it going. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=127.72s)]
*  She is still fighting to stay out of jail. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=129.5s)]
*  But that is true both for her in the Philippines and for her fellow Nobel laureate in Russia, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=133.0s)]
*  both of them facing the same kind of threats. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=139.24s)]
*  Not because either of them has done anything other than commit journalism, but that's [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  how authoritarian governments treat journalists. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=147.28s)]
*  That's how authoritarian governments treat the threat of the free press. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=150.08s)]
*  Literally even being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize cannot protect you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=154.8s)]
*  Yesterday, Argentina elected a new president, and it's the chainsaw guy, the guy whose [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=159.84s)]
*  followers wear make Argentina great again baseball hats. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=167.96s)]
*  He got a big congratulations from Republican Party leader Donald Trump when he won this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  election in Argentina yesterday. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=177.52s)]
*  He says that as Argentina's new president, he's going to eliminate that country's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=180.06s)]
*  currency and abolish its central bank. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=184.16s)]
*  He says of the 18 departments in the federal government, he's going to eliminate 10 of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=187.0s)]
*  the 18, including health and education. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=190.96s)]
*  He has said he wants a free, totally unregulated market in guns in Argentina and also a free [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=194.16s)]
*  and totally unregulated market in human organs. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=201.68s)]
*  That said, he also wants a total ban on abortion. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  So you know, freedom. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=210.2s)]
*  But with a to do list like that, what are his priorities? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=213.44s)]
*  What comes first? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=217.26s)]
*  Well, what did he talk about first after getting elected? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=218.26s)]
*  He was elected last night. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=220.84s)]
*  This was his victory speech last night. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=222.68s)]
*  You can see his his signature calm, cool, collected vibe on full display. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=225.08s)]
*  This is last night, the night he won. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=230.24s)]
*  And then today, first thing he told reporters that he's going to move to dismantle the media [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=231.70000000000002s)]
*  outlets in Argentina that gave him critical coverage during the presidential campaign. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=236.44s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=241.02s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=243.28s)]
*  This is what they do everywhere. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=244.28s)]
*  As soon as Jair Bolsonaro got elected in Brazil, this was the headline even before Bolsonaro [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=247.16s)]
*  took office. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=252.28s)]
*  Brazil's next president declares war on fake news media. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=253.28s)]
*  That was twenty eighteen when he was first elected. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=258.04s)]
*  By twenty twenty, he was publicly making a show of threatening to punch a reporter in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=260.4s)]
*  the face. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=265.68s)]
*  By twenty twenty three, when he was voted out of his office and his supporters tried [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=266.68s)]
*  their own January six style storming of the capital, his supporters were just physically [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=270.4s)]
*  attacking the press. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=276.08s)]
*  That was Brazil. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=279.72s)]
*  In Poland, it was the law and justice party there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  And headlines look remarkably familiar. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  Poland targets TV channel limits press freedom. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  Poland's ruling party rams through media law. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=289.64000000000004s)]
*  New Freedom House report. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  How Poland's government set out to conquer a free press. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=293.86s)]
*  In Hungary, it's the authoritarian Viktor Orban, who, of course, is a fan favorite of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=298.34000000000003s)]
*  American conservatives and Republican media figures under Viktor Orban. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  headlines in Hungary look like this. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=308.72s)]
*  Inside Orban's crackdown on Hungary's free press, Hungary dismantles media freedom and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=310.20000000000005s)]
*  pluralism. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=315.48s)]
*  Reporters Without Borders lists Viktor Orban as press freedom predator. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=317.36s)]
*  This is how they do it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=321.6s)]
*  They do it everywhere. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=324.12s)]
*  It speaks different languages. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  It has different accents, but it's all the same. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  In his twenty sixteen campaign and in his one term in office here, former Republican [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=331.88000000000005s)]
*  President Donald Trump, of course, made a whole sport out of it, right? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=337.88s)]
*  Denouncing the American free press as the enemy of the people and all that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=340.79999999999995s)]
*  Now that he's running for president again, though, he's getting more specific, saying [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=344.76s)]
*  he's going to have MSNBC investigated for treason. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  OK, treason. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  This weekend, Trump adviser Stephen Miller suggested that criminal charges should be [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=356.52s)]
*  brought against the media watchdog group Media Matters. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=361.79999999999995s)]
*  After Media Matters pointed out that on Twitter, the social media platform now owned by pro [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=365.6s)]
*  Trump right wing billionaire Elon Musk, major mainstream companies were having their ads [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=370.24s)]
*  appear right alongside overt pro Nazi pro Hitler anti-Semitic material of the kind that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  floods that social media platform now that Mr. Musk has taken it over and now that he [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  himself has started promoting some of the worst anti-Semitic content and sentiments on [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=385.4s)]
*  the site. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=389.56s)]
*  Stephen Miller says people should face criminal charges for pointing that out about what's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=391.88s)]
*  happening on Twitter. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=396.56s)]
*  And, you know, it's one thing for a presidential candidate's adviser to point at something [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=397.56s)]
*  like that and say, hey, your critics in the media should be in jail for criticizing you. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  But it's quite another when the Republican attorney general of the state of Missouri [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=409.68s)]
*  then jumps in and volunteers that his office in Missouri is now looking into the matter, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=412.96s)]
*  presumably to see if he can use the powers of his office as state attorney general to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=418.36s)]
*  help with the jailing your enemies part of it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=423.36s)]
*  Now tonight, the Republican attorney general of Texas says he, in fact, has opened an official [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=426.28s)]
*  investigation of Media Matters, the media watchdog group that is pointing out what advertisers [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=430.96s)]
*  on Twitter are having their ads show up alongside on that now totally unmoderated, mostly unmoderated [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=436.88s)]
*  medium. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=444.8s)]
*  Why does the attorney general of Texas need to investigate Media Matters for having criticized [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=447.18s)]
*  a right-wing billionaire? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=454.22s)]
*  Because, you know, make Argentina great again or something. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=456.46s)]
*  Put the pacifist in jail for seven years in a Russian penal colony for the price tags [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=462.46s)]
*  protest. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=467.94s)]
*  Arrest the editors. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=469.5s)]
*  Drive their publications out of the country. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=471.3s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=475.46s)]
*  First it was Alabama. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=477.74s)]
*  Surprised Supreme Court win for black voters. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=479.86s)]
*  Soon it was also Georgia. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=483.02s)]
*  And then it was Louisiana, too. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=485.42s)]
*  All states where major court decisions called for the drawing of new congressional maps [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=487.82s)]
*  that would give black voters a chance at fair representation after Republican legislators [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=492.86s)]
*  drew up districts that deliberately locked black voters out of any reasonable chance [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=497.3s)]
*  of electing the legislators of their choice. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=501.7s)]
*  These were all states where voters and voting rights groups were able to sue to get fair [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=504.5s)]
*  representation for black voters. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=509.82s)]
*  And they were able to win. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=512.66s)]
*  They won surprising, meaningful, consequential victories for black voters thanks to the Voting [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=513.86s)]
*  Rights Act of 1965. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=520.94s)]
*  The cases appeared to open a path toward undoing racially discriminatory congressional maps [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=523.34s)]
*  of the past. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=529.1s)]
*  State by state. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=531.18s)]
*  One by one. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=532.18s)]
*  Until now. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=534.66s)]
*  Until today. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=535.66s)]
*  Today a panel of three federal judges, all appointed by Republicans, issued a decision [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=536.66s)]
*  in a case that was brought by the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=542.46s)]
*  It challenges the fairness of congressional maps there. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=546.3s)]
*  And these judges in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, they ruled that private citizens, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=549.98s)]
*  private entities, private groups, can't bring these cases anymore. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=556.94s)]
*  They can't bring the kind of cases that we have seen succeed in Alabama and Georgia and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=561.26s)]
*  Louisiana and other states. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=565.9399999999999s)]
*  The judges ruled that entities, private entities, can't bring those kinds of cases. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=567.9s)]
*  Actually, the only entity that can bring that kind of a case is the United States Attorney General. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=572.62s)]
*  And if you can't get the United States Attorney General to bring a case like this on your [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=580.42s)]
*  behalf, then what happens in your state? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=584.8599999999999s)]
*  And what happens to the cases that have been decided already? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=587.8199999999999s)]
*  What happens to other states where voters want to challenge a racially discriminatory [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=590.4599999999999s)]
*  gerrymander of the congressional maps? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=596.14s)]
*  How long before this case gets to the United States Supreme Court and what's going to happen [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=599.0999999999999s)]
*  when it gets there? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=602.9799999999999s)]
*  The headline in the New York Times tonight is, federal court moves to drastically weaken [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=604.4599999999999s)]
*  Voting Rights Act. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=609.18s)]
*  Past in 1965, the Voting Rights Act was one of the most significant achievements of the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=611.6999999999999s)]
*  civil rights movement, undoing decades of discriminatory Jim Crow laws and protecting [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=614.98s)]
*  against egregious racial gerrymanders. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=619.94s)]
*  But the law has been under legal assault almost since its inception. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=623.1400000000001s)]
*  Today, a federal appeals court moved to drastically weaken it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=627.0200000000001s)]
*  Should today's ruling stand, it would remove perhaps the most important facet of the Voting [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=630.7800000000001s)]
*  Rights Act. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=636.1400000000001s)]
*  The majority of challenges to discriminatory laws have come from private citizens and civil [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=637.1s)]
*  rights groups. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=642.74s)]
*  Joining us now is Janay Nelson. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=644.0600000000001s)]
*  She's president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=645.46s)]
*  Ms. Nelson, thanks very much for joining us, especially on short notice with this surprise [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=648.74s)]
*  ruling tonight. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=652.0s)]
*  Happy to be here, Rachel. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=653.0s)]
*  So let me just ask you, I feel like for the last 10 years since the Supreme Court ruling [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=656.26s)]
*  in 2013 that really took a lot of the power of the Voting Rights Act away, we have been [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=662.98s)]
*  talking about this landmark piece of legislation, this sort of moral crucible piece of American [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=668.5s)]
*  legislation as having been severely weakened. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=675.02s)]
*  What is important about tonight's ruling as compared to the other attacks on the Voting [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=678.8199999999999s)]
*  Rights Act that we've seen from this conservative court? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=684.5799999999999s)]
*  Well, tonight's ruling upends almost 60 years of precedent in which, as you noted, individuals [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=687.26s)]
*  and civil rights groups have enforced section two of the Voting Rights Act to make sure [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=695.22s)]
*  that our country has a democracy that is free from racial discrimination. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=699.74s)]
*  It's something that we've never fully achieved, but the Voting Rights Act and section two [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=705.38s)]
*  in particular has done such muscular work to advance us toward this goal. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=709.1400000000001s)]
*  And this is the first decision to say unequivocally that individuals and civil rights groups [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=714.7800000000001s)]
*  like the Legal Defense Fund cannot bring lawsuits under this key provision. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=721.7s)]
*  And it's interesting that you bring up Shelby County versus Holder, which as you noted 10 [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=727.62s)]
*  years ago gutted what was the most transformative provision of the Voting Rights Act, section [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=731.7s)]
*  five. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=735.94s)]
*  And in that decision, Chief Justice Roberts is striking down that key part of the Voting [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=736.94s)]
*  Rights Act, pointed to section two and said, you can still use section two to vindicate [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=742.0600000000001s)]
*  your rights. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=747.26s)]
*  There's still a vehicle to address racial discrimination in our elections. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=748.26s)]
*  And yet a panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in this country said no. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=752.4200000000001s)]
*  Individuals, individual voters, citizens, civil rights groups, good government groups [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=758.86s)]
*  who have brought litigation under section two for decades now can no longer do that. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=763.02s)]
*  And the only possible vehicle is through the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=768.18s)]
*  General. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=774.3399999999999s)]
*  That is woefully inadequate for so many reasons. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=775.3399999999999s)]
*  Not only does DOJ have limited resources and limited time and limited bandwidth, as we [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=778.26s)]
*  know, not every Department of Justice is the same. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=783.5s)]
*  And in the last administration, we saw voting rights suits come to a screeching halt. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=786.9s)]
*  In fact, the Legal Defense Fund had to step in and effectively be a Department of Justice [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=792.1s)]
*  during that period of that administration. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=797.46s)]
*  We can't allow our voting rights to depend on the political whims or machinations of [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=800.34s)]
*  a particular administration. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=806.58s)]
*  Individual citizens deserve the right to vindicate the right to vote, which is so fundamental [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=808.58s)]
*  to our democracy. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=813.32s)]
*  And when we think about the movements on the right, both in and outside of the legal system, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=817.3000000000001s)]
*  that have sort of brought us to this place today, it's hard not to, I think, ascribe [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=823.3000000000001s)]
*  the worst motives to this assault on the Voting Rights Act. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=830.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the Voting Rights Act is designed to remove racial discrimination from the voting [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=833.3000000000001s)]
*  system. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=837.3000000000001s)]
*  If you are trying to get rid of the Voting Rights Act, you are trying to get rid of protections [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=838.3000000000001s)]
*  against racial discrimination in voting. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=841.3000000000001s)]
*  So it's a way to get away from that simple fundamental truth of it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=844.28s)]
*  But when it comes to this particular part of the way the Voting Rights Act works, Section [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=847.28s)]
*  2, which as you say, allows groups like the Legal Defense Fund, allows groups, individual [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=851.28s)]
*  groups, allows other voting rights groups to bring these cases, to test whether or not [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=855.28s)]
*  voting provisions are racially discriminatory. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=860.28s)]
*  Is there some beef that the right has with that in particular? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=863.28s)]
*  Is there some case that they feel like is particularly wrong or there's something that [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=866.28s)]
*  I think has been egregiously mishandled in the way that Section 2 has been operative [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=872.26s)]
*  in states across the country for all the decades that this has been in place? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=876.26s)]
*  You know, what's fascinating, Rachel, is that we've brought suits against Democrats and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=882.26s)]
*  Republicans. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=886.26s)]
*  We are a nonpartisan organization. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=887.26s)]
*  We enforce Section 2 and all other provisions of the Voting Rights Act on behalf of voters [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=889.26s)]
*  to ensure that no matter who the actor is, no matter what party they might be affiliated [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=894.26s)]
*  with, that they don't trample on that fundamental right. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=898.26s)]
*  So really, there's no reason to cast this in partisan terms. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=901.26s)]
*  There's no reason for any party to feel that the Voting Rights Act is not a fair exercise [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=905.26s)]
*  of congressional authority to ensure that the 14th and 15th Amendments of our Constitution [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=911.26s)]
*  are honored when we talk about this critical right that undergirds our entire democracy. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=917.26s)]
*  But of course, if you are prone to manipulating rules, manipulating districting lines, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=923.26s)]
*  manipulating elections in every possible way to win against a majority of the people in [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=929.26s)]
*  this country, then yes, you might have a beef with the Voting Rights Act, but that is no [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=936.26s)]
*  way to run a democracy. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=941.26s)]
*  That is no way to ensure that all voices are equally heard. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=943.26s)]
*  This news comes tonight at a time when literal neo-Nazis, dudes with big swastika flags, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=947.26s)]
*  were marching in Wisconsin this weekend, rallying outside a historic Jewish site in downtown [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=954.26s)]
*  Madison, Wisconsin. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=959.26s)]
*  That was Saturday this weekend. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=960.26s)]
*  Then the very next day, Sunday morning, a grenade was found strapped to a pole outside [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=962.26s)]
*  a synagogue in Lakewood, New Jersey. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=967.26s)]
*  Today, federal charges were filed against a Utah man who allegedly made multiple death [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=971.26s)]
*  threats to an organization in D.C. advocating for Palestinian rights. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=976.26s)]
*  This comes at a time when the Israel-Hamas War feels just like an unceasing bloodbath [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=982.26s)]
*  at this point, with Hamas still holding Israelis hostage for a month and a half now, with the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=988.26s)]
*  death toll inside Gaza now estimated at over 13,000 people killed, with one and a half [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=995.26s)]
*  million people displaced in Gaza from their homes with nowhere to go, slim to no hope [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1001.26s)]
*  that there will be anywhere for them to return to at all at any time. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1006.26s)]
*  The moral calamity and the ongoing catastrophe in that war has caused such suffering and [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1011.26s)]
*  death there and such grief and outrage around the world here in the United States that has [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1018.26s)]
*  correlated not just with grief and outrage, but with a major spike in hate crimes committed [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1023.26s)]
*  by Americans against other Americans, which makes it just an extra-auspicious time for [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1028.26s)]
*  the richest man in the world to be using his media outlet to tell the world effectively [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1033.26s)]
*  that white people have an enemy in the Jews, for Republican political figures to say that [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1038.26s)]
*  they might like to lock up anyone in the media who criticizes him for that, for the leader [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1043.26s)]
*  of the Republican Party to be promising treason investigations for his perceived critics in [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1049.26s)]
*  the media, and also that he's going to use the U.S. Army against American civilians who [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1054.26s)]
*  protest against him, and also that he's going to build camps in America in which he's going [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1058.26s)]
*  to lock up millions of people because he wants power again so he can crush his enemies and [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1062.26s)]
*  root out what he calls the vermin in this country, the people who oppose him, the internal [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1069.26s)]
*  threat. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1073.26s)]
*  It is, of course, never a good time for any of this, but the fact that this is all happening [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1074.26s)]
*  at once right now. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1079.26s)]
*  It's like the difference between one warning light going off on your dashboard while you're [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1081.26s)]
*  driving and all the warning lights going off all at once while you're driving, right? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1086.26s)]
*  When the latter happens, you pull over because obviously this is serious. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1091.26s)]
*  After a big six-week-long strike this fall, the United Auto Workers announced today that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1097.26s)]
*  their members have voted to ratify the historic new contracts the union was able to negotiate [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1101.26s)]
*  with Ford and GM and Stellantis. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1106.26s)]
*  One of the interesting effects of this strike, though, is how the other auto companies, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1108.26s)]
*  non-union auto companies, are also giving their workers a raise because of the UAW strike. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1112.26s)]
*  It's almost certainly just about dissuading their own workers from also wanting to join the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1118.26s)]
*  UAW given what the UAW was able to get for their members at other auto companies. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1123.26s)]
*  But whatever the motivation, a raise is a raise. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1128.26s)]
*  Toyota was the first non-union auto worker to announce a wage increase for their workers in the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1131.26s)]
*  U.S. after the UAW got their deal. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1135.26s)]
*  But now all these non-union auto makers are saying the same thing. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1137.26s)]
*  Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Subaru now all say they're going to raise wages for their workers too. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1140.26s)]
*  Again, they're trying to keep their workers from joining the union by showing them that they can [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1145.26s)]
*  get a wage raise without being in the union. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1150.26s)]
*  Last week, UAW President Sean Fain told a Senate committee they call this the UAW bump. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1155.26s)]
*  He says in this case the initials stand for UAW, you are welcome. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1160.26s)]
*  In the past few months, labor unions across a whole bunch of different industries have been [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1165.26s)]
*  showing the power of organizing in the workplace, and that is true right here at MSNBC. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1170.26s)]
*  Last week, after more than two years of negotiations, the MSNBC union members of the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1174.26s)]
*  Writers Guild of America East reached a tentative agreement with management on a first contract. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1181.26s)]
*  Now the union membership is going to vote on whether to accept the deal, but having a tentative [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1186.26s)]
*  agreement feels like a breath of fresh air for everybody in this space. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1191.26s)]
*  Watch this space along with all of us. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1196.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU6QKnog5hc&t=1210.26s)]
