# 'Holy crap on steroids!': Top Trump officials exposed in shocking, sloppy military security blunder
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok)
*  So here's three proper names, proper nouns actually. Michael Waltz is the National Security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=0.0s)]
*  Advisor for Donald Trump, that's one. Signal, that's two. Signal is a free, very popular [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=7.16s)]
*  encrypted messaging app that lots of journalists and public officials use for private communication. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=12.56s)]
*  And the third proper name, proper noun here, is Jeffrey Goldberg. He's the editor-in-chief [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=17.86s)]
*  of the Atlantic magazine. And here is the astounding collision of those three proper [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=23.72s)]
*  National Security Advisor, Michael Waltz, Signal, the encrypted messaging app, and Jeffrey [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=29.12s)]
*  Goldberg, well-known journalist. Quote, the Trump administration accidentally texted me [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=34.92s)]
*  its war plans by Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg. He says, quote, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=40.24s)]
*  On Tuesday, March 11th, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Michael Waltz. I accepted the connection request, hoping this was the actual National Security [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=51.04s)]
*  Advisor and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine or Iran or some other important matter. Two [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=56.24s)]
*  days later, Thursday, at 4.28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=61.28s)]
*  chat group. It was called the Houthi PC Small Group. A message to the group from Michael [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=66.72s)]
*  Waltz read as follows, team, establishing a principles, misspelled, principles group [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=74.4s)]
*  for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. Now you could see why [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg would be skeptical that this is real, right? That he really has been added to a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=89.04s)]
*  private chat group for high level coordination of something having to do with the Houthis and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  the war in Yemen. But the list of the people in the chat appeared to include not just Trump [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  National Security Advisor, Michael Waltz, but also Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=105.92000000000002s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=110.32s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. Still amazing. Still amazing. Trump's Chief of Staff, Susie Wiles, Trump's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=114.96s)]
*  Deputy Chief of Staff, Stephen Miller, Trump's Middle East envoy and real estate friend, Steve [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  Witkoff, who incidentally says he recently took a painting of Donald Trump to the White House as a [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=126.96s)]
*  gift from the Kremlin. Did you guys X-ray that? Also the Vice President of the United States, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=133.28s)]
*  J.D. Vance, all these people appear to be on this group chat. If journalist Jeffrey Goldberg [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=140.0s)]
*  remains skeptical that these were actually those people on the chat, the Trump officials in the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=147.52s)]
*  chat apparently didn't realize that their discussion now included a very well-known [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=153.36s)]
*  Washington journalist. Like it actually appears that not only were they all talking about this [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=158.32s)]
*  topic on signal, but none of them checked to see who else was in the group while they were chatting. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=163.68s)]
*  Nobody said like, oh, who's in this group? Jeffrey Goldberg says Pete Hegseth at one point told the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=170.48s)]
*  group, quote, We are currently clean on OPSEC. They were not clean on OPSEC. They were not clean [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=177.68s)]
*  on operational security, not even close. We know he sent that text because a journalist was in the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=186.88s)]
*  group chat that he was texting. Currently clean on OPSEC. Must have felt cool to say it though, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=192.8s)]
*  right? What skeptical Jeffrey Goldberg saw in that chat ended up becoming sensitive enough [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=198.24s)]
*  that he doesn't fully describe it in his story today, but he does report that on the morning of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=206.88s)]
*  Saturday, March 15th at quote 11 44 a.m. the account labeled Pete Hegseth posted in signal a team [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=211.12s)]
*  update. Goldberg says, I will not quote from this update or from certain other subsequent texts. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  What I will say in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this signal conversation, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=224.08s)]
*  is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=228.4s)]
*  including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying and attack sequencing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  According to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=241.36s)]
*  two hours hence at 1 45 p.m. Eastern time. When sure enough, the first explosions from the U.S. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  military strikes were reported in the capital of Yemen. And then the group chat celebrated [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=254.0s)]
*  the military effort with great work and good job and fire emojis. Jeffrey Goldberg says he watched [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=261.28s)]
*  the attack play out from his car in a grocery store parking lot. Once he had seen enough to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=268.32s)]
*  know that this actually had been a real group chat with those actual people, he got out. He [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=273.36s)]
*  left the chat. They had apparently been texting him and each other classified information [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=279.52s)]
*  on a commercially available non-classified text based communication system. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=286.88s)]
*  A spokesperson for the National Security Council later confirmed what Jeff Goldberg [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  already understood, quote, This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=298.96s)]
*  an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The administration confirmed for NBC News that it is [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=304.64s)]
*  reviewing how this happened. The whole story is, I mean, how is this real life? I just, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  how are these people in charge of what they're in charge of? I will tell you that Defense Secretary [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=318.08s)]
*  Pete Hegseth told reporters today, quote, Nobody was texting war plans. I will also tell you the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=323.44s)]
*  president said that he hadn't heard about any of this until a reporter asked. He said he had no [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  idea. News to him didn't know a thing about it. Well, we will all have plenty of opportunity to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=336.24s)]
*  hear more about it. The ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Jack Reid, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=341.84s)]
*  called the carelessness by Trump's cabinet, quote, stunning and dangerous. He said, quote, I will be [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=346.32s)]
*  seeking answers from the administration immediately. Democratic Senator Chris Coons from the Foreign [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=352.64s)]
*  Relations Committee said this story, quote, calls for a prompt and thorough investigation. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=357.28s)]
*  Saying this is a shocking breach of the standards for sharing classified information that could have [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=364.32s)]
*  put American service members at risk. Because God keeps a date book, two of the Trump cabinet [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=368.32s)]
*  members who were in that group chat, Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe, were already scheduled to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  appear on Capitol Hill tomorrow morning as witnesses for the Senate Intelligence Committee's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  open hearing on worldwide threats. Joining us now is Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=383.44s)]
*  He's the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Sir, it's always an honor to have you [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=389.6s)]
*  with us. Thanks for making time to be here tonight. Thank you, Rachel. Let me start by getting your [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=393.52s)]
*  reaction to this story. Let me also ask if you learned about it in the Atlantic the way that we [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=401.2s)]
*  all did or if there was some governmental response that we don't know about here. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=406.56s)]
*  Well, Rachel, I didn't think this administration could still shock me. But today's story, which I [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=410.48s)]
*  read about in the Atlantic, was beyond belief. It was like, holy crap, on steroids. This is another [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=414.8s)]
*  example of carelessness, sloppiness, and a crowd that's not ready for prime time. I mean, the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=422.40000000000003s)]
*  remarkable thing, you think about you're on a group chat and you don't know who everybody is. I mean, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=430.16s)]
*  if this had been an intelligence officer who had done this, they'd be fired immediately. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=436.0s)]
*  And the truth is, you know, signal is not a classified channel. I got questions tomorrow. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=443.28s)]
*  Have they collected all the phones to make sure malware is not on some of these phones now? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=449.6s)]
*  Do they realize that Russia and China have targeted signal to try to break in? Do they realize that, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=454.0s)]
*  and frankly, I think Hegseth needs to go or Walz needs to go. The idea that you are conveying [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  on this encrypted but not classified means the actual military plans, and I believe Jeff Goldberg, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=467.28s)]
*  my God, if this had been the Democrats, there would be investigations. There would be [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  hearings, and we're going to have this tomorrow. We're going to have it out in the open hearing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  This crowd is not ready for prime time. And I would point out Tulsi Gabbard, who all of the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=483.52s)]
*  Democrats supposed as director of national intelligence, who's been a spokesman on many [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=489.04s)]
*  right wing media since she got this job, is said about the same time, if there is any leaker, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=493.36s)]
*  they've got to be held fully accountable. What we're going to ask tomorrow, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=499.36s)]
*  beyond Hegseth, beyond Walz, what other in this group should be held fully accountable for, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=503.68s)]
*  frankly, breaching security protocols 101. And I just point out quickly that, you know, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=509.12s)]
*  this comes on top of them releasing a couple hundred of CIA names of people who were, you know, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=514.64s)]
*  a couple, a year or so in. We spent a couple hundred thousand dollars on these agents, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=520.16s)]
*  getting them cleared, getting them through training. All of their identities were [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=524.08s)]
*  revealed. Those guys can't go out and work around the world anymore. We've had other [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=528.08s)]
*  classifications revealed. And we've obviously got the Doge boys out there printing totally wrong [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=532.64s)]
*  information about supposed savings. At what point, and I'm glad to see you're highlighting all the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=539.68s)]
*  Americans around the country rising up, but I hope those who care about our national security [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=544.16s)]
*  will also start rising up. We are not made safer by these actions. Let me ask if this is a big [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  enough shock that you expect that some of your Republican colleagues may join you in calling for [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=556.48s)]
*  John Rockliffe to resign, calling on Pete Hegseth to resign. I mean, I feel like I've covered a lot [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  of embarrassing, inadvertent releases of sensitive information of various types, where things through [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=568.0799999999999s)]
*  recklessness or negligence have been released. This seems to have been a deliberate decision [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=574.08s)]
*  to create a completely insecure communications medium that is compounded by the stupidity of [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=578.64s)]
*  having included a journalist and not known they were doing it. But I just feel like this is so [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=587.44s)]
*  much worse than anything we've ever seen for people operating at this kind of a level. Will [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=591.44s)]
*  Republicans care about it? Listen, this is gross negligence on steroids. And if they don't step up, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=596.08s)]
*  and I got a lot of respect for the folks I work with on the intelligence, but I've been disappointed. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=603.36s)]
*  I was disappointed when more of them didn't stand up against Tulsi Gabbard when she refused to call [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=608.24s)]
*  Edward Snowden a traitor. But at some point, something's got to give. And people who care [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  about our national security, people who don't want the American first to be America alone, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=620.32s)]
*  because if we don't have friends and allies, if countries around the world won't share their [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=626.24s)]
*  intelligence with us because a bunch of sloppy folks are putting it out on a non-classified [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=631.12s)]
*  signal channel, if you're not willing to stand up and call that out, what level of abuse, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=637.68s)]
*  what level of sloppiness will it take to rise up and actually stand up for the country? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=644.8s)]
*  Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner, senior Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. I know [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=650.32s)]
*  you've got a very big day tomorrow with this very, very high pressure hearing. Thank you for taking [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=654.4s)]
*  time to join us tonight. I appreciate it, sir. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvUemlDoaok&t=658.72s)]
