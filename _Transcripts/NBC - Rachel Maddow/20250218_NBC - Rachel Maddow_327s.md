# Musk's clueless job slashing backfires again; principled protest resignations stymie Trump's agenda
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw)
*  NBC News reporting tonight that the Trump administration accidentally—oops, totally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=0.0s)]
*  didn't mean to fire the people working on bird flu. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  No idea how that happened. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=10.08s)]
*  Now the bird flu experts at USDA, they are trying to hire them back. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=12.84s)]
*  They did this with the National Nuclear Security Administration as well, which we talked about [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  on last night's show. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=23.66s)]
*  Now it's with the bird flu workers. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=25.0s)]
*  Oops. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=28.12s)]
*  What does this button do? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=29.92s)]
*  Does anybody know what this button does? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  I thought I should ask because just a minute ago I just pushed it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=33.72s)]
*  Does anybody know what it does? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=36.72s)]
*  Got any other buttons I can push? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=39.24s)]
*  The Washington Post reports tonight that the Trump administration is considering a plan [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=43.64s)]
*  to incinerate $500 million worth of COVID tests that you've already paid for. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=47.52s)]
*  It's not because there's anything wrong with these COVID tests. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=55.0s)]
*  It's just because, I guess, you know, COVID tests. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=57.36s)]
*  Icky. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=61.96s)]
*  $500 million worth of perfectly good COVID tests that we, the taxpayers, already purchased. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=62.96s)]
*  They are in storage. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=70.76s)]
*  They are stockpiled right now, set to be distributed for free to the American people in the event [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=72.76s)]
*  of another big uptick in COVID. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=78.06s)]
*  But instead, the Trump administration apparently wants to destroy them because, you know, government [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=80.68s)]
*  efficiency. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=87.84s)]
*  The Trump administration just today fired more than 10% of the staff at the National [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=90.64s)]
*  Science Foundation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=94.76s)]
*  National Science Foundation was founded in 1950 to promote science and engineering and [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=96.12s)]
*  work on U.S. defense and public health. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  National Science Foundation provides a quarter of the federal support that goes for basic [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=104.42s)]
*  research at America's colleges and universities. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=109.16s)]
*  It's how we fund astronomy observatories. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=112.6s)]
*  It is how we fund our research stations in Antarctica. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=114.72s)]
*  Trump just today fired a huge proportion of their workforce. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=118.84s)]
*  A senior engineer at the GSA, the General Services Administration, has also just resigned [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  today, reportedly after trying to block people working for President Trump's top campaign [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=129.2s)]
*  donor, Elon Musk, trying to block one of Musk's guys from a system called Notify.gov. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=136.48s)]
*  Notify.gov is a system whereby the government can contact you directly. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=143.72s)]
*  Individual citizens can be contacted directly from federal agencies. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=149.6s)]
*  It is a secure system. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=153.76s)]
*  It's obviously very sensitive because it's your personal cell phone number that is linked [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  to information about you and your status and involvement with any number of government [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=160.48s)]
*  agencies. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=165.32s)]
*  Obviously, that's a very sensitive thing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=166.32s)]
*  But this man named Thomas Shedd, who until recently worked for Tesla but was just installed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=168.96s)]
*  inside the GSA by the president's top donor, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, Mr. Shedd apparently [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=175.08s)]
*  demanded full read-write access to that Notify.gov system. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=181.96s)]
*  In response, the lead engineer in charge of that system, a GSA employee named Stephen [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=188.8s)]
*  Riley, apparently, quote, objected to Shedd's ability to view phone numbers and variable [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=193.44000000000003s)]
*  data for members of the public, information that Shedd, quote, would be able to download [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=200.28s)]
*  and store without anyone knowing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=205.28s)]
*  Riley wrote to his colleagues that once he had obtained this information, Shedd, quote, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  could also grant the same access to others. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  He said, quote, we have not received a justification for this request, which makes it difficult [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=217.24s)]
*  to suggest alternative approaches that would accomplish Shedd's goals while still being [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=221.0s)]
*  protective of personally identifying information for members of the public. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=225.44s)]
*  Riley said, quote, I don't believe I can operate a program and system without the ability [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=230.08s)]
*  to manage access to personally identifying information about American citizens. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=233.96s)]
*  He said, quote, as a result, I have submitted my resignation to GSA. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=240.16s)]
*  Today will be my last day. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=243.72s)]
*  The lead engineer at the General Services Administration trying to protect your personally [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=248.24s)]
*  identifying information linked to your cell phone number and resigning in protest when [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=252.12s)]
*  he couldn't do it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=257.8s)]
*  In resigning on these terms, he has let we the public know that President Donald Trump [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=260.56s)]
*  apparently wants to give your cell phone number and personally identifying information about [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=268.04s)]
*  you, including any of your interactions with any federal government agency to a random [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  guy from Elon Musk's car company. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  And wants to give him this information in a way that would allow him to walk out the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=281.44000000000005s)]
*  door with it and give it to anyone else he wanted. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=284.6s)]
*  So by resigning, trying to stop it, being unable to stop it, resigning in protest and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  then explaining exactly why he resigned and what the problem was, he has let the public [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=295.76000000000005s)]
*  know that this has just happened to us, which itself is a mitzvah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5tiXTKQqw&t=301.28s)]
