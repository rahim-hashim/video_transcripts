# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Mar. 4
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0)
*  This is a 3,500-ton frigate that was the flagship vessel of Ukraine's, I would say relatively [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=0.0s)]
*  small Navy until it was sunk. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=8.52s)]
*  Not by Russian forces, actually, but by Ukraine itself. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=12.24s)]
*  The ship had been docked for repairs in the port city of Mikhailov and on the Black Sea [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=15.56s)]
*  Coast when the war broke out last week. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=21.64s)]
*  And the captain of the ship actually feared that those repairs would not be finished in [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=23.56s)]
*  time to prevent the crown jewel of Ukraine's Navy from falling into Russian hands. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=27.84s)]
*  He did not want to take that risk. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=33.16s)]
*  So he basically carried out orders to sink the ship. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=35.56s)]
*  Ukraine's defense minister described the captain's predicament this way, saying, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=39.64s)]
*  "'It is hard to imagine a more difficult decision for a courageous man and his crew, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=42.64s)]
*  but we will build a new fleet.'" [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=47.64s)]
*  Russian forces are waging, as we heard, an all-out assault across the southern region [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=49.92s)]
*  which is the only region of Ukraine that actually has access to the sea. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=54.52s)]
*  Kherson, the first Ukrainian city to be captured by Russian forces, is quickly running out [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=59.6s)]
*  of medical supplies. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=64.2s)]
*  Mariupol, also in the southern part of the country, has been under siege, cut off from [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=65.36s)]
*  access to the water, power, food supplies. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  Now it's going on for days. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=72.68s)]
*  In the southern city of Odessa, where we just got that live report, the population there [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=74.48s)]
*  is actually getting ready to mount a defense of their city after unverified reports suggest [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=79.44s)]
*  a fleet of Russian warships heading in their direction. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=84.91999999999999s)]
*  That is the situation right now in southern Ukraine. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=88.8s)]
*  But the assault by Putin's army in the northern part of the country, while horrifying in its [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=92.0s)]
*  own right, is actually moving much, much slowly. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  A 40-mile convoy of Russian troops remain stalled outside the capital city of Kiev. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  And despite the hellish shelling that the capital and Kharkiv that we have seen night [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=104.88s)]
*  after night, some U.S. officials are actually reportedly surprised by the risk-averse approach [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=109.6s)]
*  that Russia has taken with its vast air power against Ukraine's much smaller air force. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  As one retired three-star Air Force general told Reuters, the Russians are discovering [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=121.72s)]
*  that coordinating multi-domain operations is not easy and that they are not as good [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=125.97999999999999s)]
*  as they presume they were. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=131.4s)]
*  What should we expect to see in the coming days as Putin continues his siege against [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=133.72s)]
*  the people of Ukraine? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=137.72s)]
*  Joining us now for more on that, Rob Lee, former Marine Corps infantry officer and senior [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=138.88s)]
*  fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=142.92s)]
*  Rob, it's good to see you again. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=145.6s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=146.88s)]
*  Let's assess this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=148.6s)]
*  What do you think it is that Russian forces, you know, they're doing better in the south [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=149.6s)]
*  it seems than they are in the north. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=154.8s)]
*  I'm curious to get your thoughts on why that might be. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=156.0s)]
*  Is that a sign of Russia and its offensive capabilities in the south or a sign of better [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=159.24s)]
*  Ukrainian forces and posture in the north? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, thanks for having me. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=167.24s)]
*  So I think it's a combination of things, but I think one of them is that Ukrainian forces [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=169.84s)]
*  have decided where, you know, what strategic areas they have to defend and what areas can [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  they kind of trade, you know, time for space. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  And so I think that's what they're doing in the south. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=181.72s)]
*  As you know, you gave a very good kind of briefing of what's going on. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=183.56s)]
*  Ultimately, they're continuing to advance south towards Nikolayev. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=186.68s)]
*  They took the city of Arohodan yesterday, where the nuclear plant is pushing towards [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=190.44s)]
*  Aparizha and obviously Mariupol is still surrounded in the southeast. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=195.28s)]
*  But as we've seen in the last few days, the big cities in the northeast have not fallen. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  So Kharkiv, Sumy, Ternigov and obviously Kiev and Ukrainian forces are still holding those. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=204.08s)]
*  And essentially from now on, it's difficult for Ukraine's military to fight a conventional [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=209.84s)]
*  fight with the Russian military. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=213.92s)]
*  But if one certain cities, it negates a lot of the strengths of Russian military. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=215.28s)]
*  And I think that's what their strategy is going on. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=219.16s)]
*  Do you have a sense of how at this current moment, the Ukrainian military is managing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=222.32s)]
*  its supply lines? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=229.0s)]
*  I mean, what happens to Ukraine's military if Russia does manage to cut off their access [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=230.0s)]
*  to the sea? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=234.32s)]
*  We know that the US and Western countries are trying to resupply various Ukrainian positions. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=235.32s)]
*  Do we know if that is happening by airlift, by land route, by sea? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=239.84s)]
*  So I'm not sure. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=244.72s)]
*  And one thing that's really noted about this conflict is that there's much more information [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=245.72s)]
*  about what Russia is doing than there is about the Ukrainian military. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=249.12s)]
*  I think there are a variety of reasons about that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=252.0s)]
*  But as long as the Western border of Ukraine is open to these NATO members, ultimately [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=253.6s)]
*  NATO can continue to supply it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=259.08s)]
*  And so even if I think the naval access is cut off, that land border will still be very [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=260.48s)]
*  significant. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=264.92s)]
*  And ultimately Russia doesn't really have any easy way of cutting that off at the time [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=265.92s)]
*  being given that their land forces aren't near it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=269.56s)]
*  In addition, Ukraine's air defenses are still capable. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=272.12s)]
*  Their air force is still operating. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=275.36s)]
*  And so Russia still can't operate with impunity in Western Ukraine to kind of interdict any [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=276.88s)]
*  of those supply lines. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=281.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=282.24s)]
*  And that brings up a really interesting question about the airspace above Ukraine. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=283.24s)]
*  I mean, I have seen the Russian military operate in Syria. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=286.0s)]
*  I think it tipped the balance in that fight between the Syrians and the opposition. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=289.56s)]
*  But Ukraine's airspace, as you said, remains contested. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think it has a lot of people scratching their heads. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  Why do you think we are not seeing even more aggression from Russia's much larger and presumably [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=299.84s)]
*  at one point a pretty sophisticated air force? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  So it is still very surprising. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  And I think at this point, we have to kind of look at the capabilities of Russian Air [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  Force and start questioning whether or not they're capable of doing certain operations [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  that say the US Air Force is capable of. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=320.0s)]
*  And it's pretty clear they aren't. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  And so their ability to suppress or destroy enemy air defenses has a struggle to do so. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=323.4s)]
*  They've struggled to knock out the Ukrainian Air Force. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=328.92s)]
*  The Ukrainian Air Force continues to wreak havoc on their supply lines, including with [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=331.48s)]
*  those TB2 unmanned combat air vehicles. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=335.4s)]
*  And so it appears that the Russian Air Force is having some difficulties here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=338.04s)]
*  And I think one of the important things to remember in previous conflicts, in 2014, 2015, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=340.84s)]
*  the Russian Air Force didn't really play much role in the Donbass, mostly because of plausible [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  deniability reasons for Russia. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=349.56s)]
*  And in Syria, it has played a key role. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=350.92s)]
*  But they haven't gone against a capable air defense system. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=353.24s)]
*  And so it's basically been operating with relative impunity for most of those areas [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=356.76s)]
*  and then just working on the targeting process. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=360.8s)]
*  But right now, this operation is much, much more complex. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=362.84s)]
*  It's much larger. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  And you have much larger Russian ground forces on the ground that need that kind of aerial [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=366.68s)]
*  support. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=370.0s)]
*  And so all those facts should make it more difficult for the Russian Air Force to be [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=371.0s)]
*  as effective as I thought they would be. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=373.48s)]
*  And that's certainly one of the really kind of surprising lessons from this war so far. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=375.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  Her name is Lady Anastasia. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  She's a $27 million super yacht owned by a Russian arms tycoon and the chief executive [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=384.0s)]
*  of Russia's state-owned defense conglomerate that exports weapons. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=388.04s)]
*  And right now, that yacht is docked on the island of Majorca in the Mediterranean. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  And a yacht like this, I should note, needs a lot of care, a lot of maintenance. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  They usually have a full-time staff. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=400.0s)]
*  And in the case of Lady Anastasia, a mechanic, the mechanic for Lady Anastasia is this guy, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=402.48s)]
*  55-year-old engineer from Ukraine named Taras Ostapchuk. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=408.12s)]
*  And over the weekend, that mechanic says that he saw a video of a rocket attack on this [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  residential building in Kiev, where he is from. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=417.08000000000004s)]
*  And he says that when he was watching that video, something clicked, something changed. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=420.48s)]
*  And he remembered that his boss is not only Russian, but in fact, that he is a Russian [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=425.32000000000005s)]
*  arms dealer. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=430.26000000000005s)]
*  The mechanic says he believes the missile he saw in that video was the same type of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  missile manufactured and sold by his boss. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=436.02000000000004s)]
*  So the mechanic allegedly marched onto the engine room of the super yacht and opened [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=440.96s)]
*  up several valves that were supposed to stay shut, which partially sank the Lady Anastasia. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=445.7s)]
*  And that Ukrainian mechanic was arrested, brought to court in Majorca for allegedly [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=451.2s)]
*  trying to sink the Russian man's yacht. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=455.12s)]
*  He told a judge, quote, they were attacking innocents, and I don't regret anything I've [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=458.06s)]
*  done and I would do it again. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=462.0s)]
*  That mechanic has since been released from custody. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=464.34s)]
*  And he tells us he is now back in Ukraine. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=466.65999999999997s)]
*  He is on a waitlist to be issued a weapon so he can join the fight himself. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=470.08s)]
*  The mechanic felt left custody for Ukraine, left Spain, got there so he can help defend [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=474.4s)]
*  his country. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=482.12s)]
*  That's him in this photo alongside his compatriots. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=483.12s)]
*  An act of heroic sabotage. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  This is Oleksandra. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=492.59999999999997s)]
*  She is 25 years old. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=494.36s)]
*  She lives in Kharkiv, Ukraine. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=495.84s)]
*  And today she actually spoke to the BBC about her mother. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=498.48s)]
*  Her mother actually lives in Moscow, Russia. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=502.24s)]
*  And she was telling the BBC that her own mother did not believe her when she said that her [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=504.92s)]
*  city in Kharkiv, Ukraine was being shelled by Russian forces. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=510.76s)]
*  She said, I didn't want to scare my parents, but I started telling them directly that civilians [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  and children are dying. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=519.9s)]
*  And her parents, to her surprise, responded by saying that the Russian army would never [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=521.8000000000001s)]
*  target civilians, that it's Ukrainians who are killing their own people. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=526.04s)]
*  And to her shock, Oleksandra says that her mother just repeated the narrative of what [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=530.28s)]
*  she heard on Russian state TV. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=534.56s)]
*  Russian state media, of course, has sought to obscure the reality of what is happening [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=537.3199999999999s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=540.92s)]
*  There are no reports of missiles hitting residential districts. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=542.9599999999999s)]
*  There is no coverage of Russian casualties or the ongoing protests that are taking place [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=545.88s)]
*  inside of Russia. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=550.36s)]
*  In fact, yesterday, Russia's last independent radio station, Ekomoska, was shut down and [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=551.52s)]
*  Russia's last independent TV station, TV RAIN, broadcast its final news update. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  And this morning, Russia blocked the sites of Russian language, Western media like Radio [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=562.44s)]
*  Free Europe, Voice of America, Deutsche Welle, and of course, the BBC. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=566.14s)]
*  All while the audience for the BBC's Russian language news site alone reached 10.7 million [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=570.6s)]
*  people last week alone, more than triple its usual average. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=575.88s)]
*  Now today, Russia went even further, blocking access to both Facebook and Twitter. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=580.52s)]
*  And this morning, the Russian Duma, their parliament, made it illegal and punishable [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=584.52s)]
*  by 15 years in prison to report anything the Russian government deems to be false information [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=589.4s)]
*  about the war in Ukraine. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=595.58s)]
*  Oh, by the way, Russia doesn't call it a war and neither can the reporters there. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=596.96s)]
*  They are calling it a special military operation. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=602.48s)]
*  So all of the news that you see coming out of Russia has to come from the government [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=605.6s)]
*  itself. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  The BBC announced today that this law basically left them no other option than to temporarily [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=612.0400000000001s)]
*  suspend the work of BBC news journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=617.0s)]
*  Other outlets started following suit. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  So while we have had footage to show of some of the more than 8,000 anti-war protesters [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=624.24s)]
*  that have been arrested in Russia, that kind of reporting, that kind of journalism just [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=628.96s)]
*  became a lot more risky. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=634.16s)]
*  In fact, it is now punishable. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=635.7199999999999s)]
*  And this crackdown comes as imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is calling [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=637.9599999999999s)]
*  for more mass protests inside Russia and around the world this coming Sunday. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=643.28s)]
*  Today four major Russian independent news outlets, including the Novaya Gazeta, the [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  newspaper whose editor just won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, decided that this new [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=653.7199999999999s)]
*  law actually made it impossible for them to report on the war truthfully without their [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=659.4s)]
*  reporters being thrown in prison. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=664.16s)]
*  So now they aren't reporting on it at all. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=667.02s)]
*  The independent news site Medusa was also blocked by the Russian government today, but [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=670.4399999999999s)]
*  they have experience working around the Russian government because Medusa has always reported [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=674.56s)]
*  on Russia in Russian, but they have done it from Latvia outside of Russia's borders to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=678.6s)]
*  stay as independent as possible. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=684.62s)]
*  So even though their site was blocked inside of Russia, they have not stopped reporting. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=688.02s)]
*  Joining us now from Latvia is Alexei Kovalev, the investigations editor at Medusa. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=693.46s)]
*  Mr. Kovalev, thank you so much for being with us tonight. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=698.86s)]
*  I greatly appreciate your time. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=701.14s)]
*  Let's start with the development today. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=703.42s)]
*  Now that the Russian government has blocked your website in Russia, how do you expect, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=704.6999999999999s)]
*  how do you plan on getting your news, your information, your reporting accessible to [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=709.56s)]
*  people inside of Russia? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=714.5799999999999s)]
*  Morning, Eamon, and thank you for having me. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=717.14s)]
*  Well, we've been waiting for this. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=719.62s)]
*  We've been anticipating this for quite some time. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=722.1s)]
*  So we've been educating our audience, our followers to use different means of circumventing [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=726.62s)]
*  these bans. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=733.42s)]
*  And, you know, over the past few years, Russians have become quite adept to using all kinds [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=734.42s)]
*  of VPNs and proxies because more and more huge swaths of Russian internet are becoming [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=739.54s)]
*  inaccessible to Russians for, you know, carpet bans of sorts. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=746.26s)]
*  So yeah, we had some contingency plans and we're continuing to broadcast on our app, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=751.9000000000001s)]
*  on our Telegram channel. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=757.3000000000001s)]
*  And hopefully we'll recover some of our website audience as well as people, as more and more [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=759.1s)]
*  people adopt VPNs and proxies and all kinds of different anti-internet internet blockage [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=763.86s)]
*  devices. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=771.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, incredible defiance on your part. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=772.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm curious to get your thoughts on what will this media crackdown that we have seen intensify [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=774.58s)]
*  on independent media inside actually mean for the war in Ukraine? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=779.42s)]
*  Do you think it will have any impact what Russia has done today on the information flow? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=783.9s)]
*  Well, it's crucial that the Russian public understands what's going on. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=791.34s)]
*  And this is the motivation behind such a precedent and assault on the media in the country. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=796.38s)]
*  I don't think it has any precedent in Russia's history, even in the Soviet times. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=802.38s)]
*  But what you said earlier about the BBC report, it's actually real and it's happening in [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=808.5s)]
*  many Russian families too, because like many Russian families, mine also has relatives [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=814.62s)]
*  in Ukraine, different parts of my family, my wife's family. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=819.3s)]
*  We all have Ukrainian relatives. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=822.8599999999999s)]
*  And it's happening all across that spectrum that Ukrainian relatives saying, hey, look, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=825.06s)]
*  our army is bombing our cities. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=831.5799999999999s)]
*  And the Russian relatives are saying, no, that's not true, because they told us on the [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=833.14s)]
*  television that the Russian army is not bombing any civilian infrastructure. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=838.3399999999999s)]
*  It's only striking military targets. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=844.14s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=846.9399999999999s)]
*  It's just so hard to convince people, because it's hard enough to make people admit a simple, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=847.9399999999999s)]
*  honest mistake. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=855.86s)]
*  You're actually asking them to admit complicity in war crimes. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=856.86s)]
*  So, which their television, which is on for most of the time in most Russian households, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=861.78s)]
*  has been telling them nonstop that it's simply not happening, that it couldn't be happening [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=868.0600000000001s)]
*  just because. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=871.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty hard to challenge that narrative. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=872.66s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=875.46s)]
*  So let me ask you then go back to the point that you were talking about, some of the stories [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=876.46s)]
*  or anecdotes you've been hearing from Russian family members being told about what's happening [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=879.58s)]
*  inside of Ukraine by other Ukrainian family members. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=884.2199999999999s)]
*  How does one approach trying to deprogram the chunk of the Russian population that fully [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=887.66s)]
*  believes that state TV tells them? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=892.62s)]
*  How can we and your news organization combat that level of misinformation? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=895.18s)]
*  Well, I'll be honest. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=899.9799999999999s)]
*  This looks like an insurmountable problem, because there is simply the economies of scale. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=907.3s)]
*  Dozens of millions of people are tuned into Russian TV, and fewer and fewer are going [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=917.66s)]
*  to have access to independent media like ours. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=921.8599999999999s)]
*  But it doesn't mean we're just ceasing to do our jobs. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=924.66s)]
*  Because if not for now, we're doing this for the historical record. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=930.38s)]
*  As I said before, my job is now basically documenting my country's war crimes for any [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=934.6999999999999s)]
*  future international tribunals. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=940.8599999999999s)]
*  So yeah, we're doing as much as we can to convince people to educate people about what's [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=944.06s)]
*  going on now. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=949.18s)]
*  And I think we've made some progress because people are now sharing links to Medusa and [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=950.42s)]
*  other few remaining independent media, news websites in Russia, like secret pamphlets. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=956.42s)]
*  Because what we have now is as close as we get to martial law with all the civil liberties [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=964.0999999999999s)]
*  and free press suspended. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=969.02s)]
*  Yeah, the information space in Russia continues to shrink by the day. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=972.4599999999999s)]
*  Alexei Kovalov, sir, thank you so much to you and your entire staff. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=976.26s)]
*  You are the investigations editor at the Russian language news site Medusa. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=980.3s)]
*  Greatly appreciate the work all of you are doing. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=984.0999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for your time tonight. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=986.18s)]
*  This past week, Rachel and our team here have been periodically checking in on a man named [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=988.14s)]
*  Adesa. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=993.3s)]
*  The video journalist whose work you just saw there is Whitney Leeming from the Washington [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=994.66s)]
*  Post. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=998.78s)]
*  She has been traveling south through Ukraine from Kharkiv to Dnipro to Odessa reporting [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1000.02s)]
*  on this war as it unfolds in real time. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1005.42s)]
*  Tonight, she joins us from the port city of Odessa in southwestern Ukraine, where people [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1008.9s)]
*  I spent the day filling up sandbags and gathering supplies as they await what is being described [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1013.3s)]
*  as an imminent assault from Russian forces. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1018.14s)]
*  Ms. Leeming, thank you so much for being here. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1020.6999999999999s)]
*  I know it is late your time. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1022.74s)]
*  Thanks for staying up for us. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1024.78s)]
*  Let's talk about your paper for a moment. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1026.74s)]
*  The Washington Post reported that the city is preparing, as you just said as well, amid [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1028.06s)]
*  unverified reports that a large fleet of Russian warships was heading towards the waters off [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1032.58s)]
*  of the coast. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1038.1399999999999s)]
*  Can you just expand a little bit more on what you were saying? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1039.26s)]
*  Have you heard anything about this from people you've been speaking to on the ground or perhaps [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1041.3s)]
*  even officials that they are anticipating this? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1045.5s)]
*  What is that based on? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1048.3s)]
*  There have been reports of ships off of the coast. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1051.62s)]
*  We haven't seen movement or heard of movement from official sources over the past two days. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1056.62s)]
*  So we're not sure what exactly is going on. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1063.18s)]
*  Assaults like these are very difficult and take time. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1067.22s)]
*  That time has allowed the city to prepare. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1073.1000000000001s)]
*  We are being told that the beaches are completely mined. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1076.94s)]
*  You can see when you come into the city, hedgehogs made to slow down or stop tanks and other [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1081.42s)]
*  types of cars all around the city, kind of trying to hope to slow down any forces to [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1088.3s)]
*  let the citizens prepare. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1095.46s)]
*  I understand that before you arrived in Odessa, you were in the eastern cities of Nipro and [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1097.9s)]
*  Oman. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1102.38s)]
*  What were you seeing as you moved westward? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1103.38s)]
*  Can you just describe for us that journey? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1104.8600000000001s)]
*  Are there checkpoints on the highways? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1107.8600000000001s)]
*  Was there bombardment? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1110.0200000000002s)]
*  Did you see if people trying to escape smaller towns and perhaps villages on your route? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1111.0200000000002s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1117.46s)]
*  So we made the trip from Denimpro to Oman. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1119.8200000000002s)]
*  One day it should have been about a six hour car drive. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1123.1s)]
*  It took over 12 hours. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1126.7s)]
*  You're seeing extremely long lines of evacuees. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1129.1799999999998s)]
*  Many of these people have homemade signs posted throughout their car that say children on [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1133.62s)]
*  them trying to let officials know that there's kids in the car. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1139.8999999999999s)]
*  There's many checkpoints that you have to go through. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1145.78s)]
*  Some of these are controlled by the military and city and town police. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1148.78s)]
*  Others are controlled by volunteer militia who don't have a ton of training and who are [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1155.86s)]
*  justifiably very jumpy. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1160.7s)]
*  So people are doing whatever they can to protect themselves. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1163.3799999999999s)]
*  Some of these checkpoints take hours and hours to get through. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1166.78s)]
*  We made it into Oman actually after curfew because of being stuck for hours in these [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1169.8999999999999s)]
*  long lines to get through the checkpoints. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1177.5s)]
*  You also, while you see huge caravans of families heading west, you'll see very few cars coming [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1181.74s)]
*  back east and almost all of those cars are filled with what it looks like to be single [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1189.58s)]
*  men. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1194.58s)]
*  Our assumption and from a few people that we've talked to is that people are driving [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1196.06s)]
*  their families towards safety and then returning home to protect their own neighborhoods. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB2iB3lJKq0&t=1200.46s)]
