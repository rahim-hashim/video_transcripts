# Six Questions To Help Follow The January 6th Investigation
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA)
*  All right, it is a very simple progression. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'll tell you, the bottom line, it is still not easy to figure out how this is all going [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  to end ultimately. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=7.36s)]
*  But in terms of where we are now, it is easy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=9.38s)]
*  It is very, very sort of logical and straightforward to figure out where we are in this story. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=11.76s)]
*  Because these are the questions we now know to ask. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=17.84s)]
*  Question number one, was it illegal? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=21.22s)]
*  If the answer is yes, it was illegal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=23.68s)]
*  Then the next question is, did they know it was illegal? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=25.82s)]
*  If the answer was yes, they knew it was illegal, then the next question is, did they try to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=28.84s)]
*  pull it off anyway? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=33.24s)]
*  If the answer to that is yes, they tried to pull it off anyway. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=34.68s)]
*  My next personal question is always, well, when they tried to pull it off, was it occasionally [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=39.56s)]
*  hilarious? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=43.72s)]
*  Whether or not the answer to that is yes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=46.44s)]
*  The next obvious question is, did they get caught? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  And then, of course, the final question is, will they get in trouble for it? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=54.68s)]
*  That's pretty simply where we are and sort of how we know how to orient ourself in this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=59.96s)]
*  ongoing saga, which will be, you know, our generation's story in American history. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=66.52s)]
*  Was it illegal? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=72.72s)]
*  Did they know? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=73.72s)]
*  Did they do it anyway? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=74.72s)]
*  Was it ridiculous when they did? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=75.72s)]
*  Did they get caught? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=77.0s)]
*  Will they get in trouble? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=78.8s)]
*  Now, the answer to all the first five questions we now know is yes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=81.0s)]
*  It's only that last one that's uncertain. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mavY7EkszSA&t=87.92s)]
