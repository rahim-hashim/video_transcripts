# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 24
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE)
*  Okay, it was March 1978. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=0.0s)]
*  It was early in the morning. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=3.2s)]
*  It was like 6.30 in the morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=5.0s)]
*  It was a Friday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=6.0s)]
*  And it was at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library in Independence, Missouri. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=8.0s)]
*  But it was 6.30 in the morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=12.0s)]
*  The library wasn't due to open up until regular business hours that day. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=14.0s)]
*  But a security guard working at the library that Friday morning decided he needed to go check something out [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=19.0s)]
*  because randomly a woman pulled up into a parking lot in the back part of the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=26.0s)]
*  She parked her Oldsmobile in that parking lot. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=35.0s)]
*  Again, it's hours until the library opens up. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=37.0s)]
*  She parked her car there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=40.0s)]
*  She got out of her car and she started pacing around kind of aimlessly and weirdly. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=41.0s)]
*  And there was a security guard on site, but he noticed this was odd. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=46.0s)]
*  This woman was acting weirdly in the back parking lot. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=51.0s)]
*  And so the security guard went over to that side of the building, the back side of the library, to look out into the parking lot to try to figure out what was going on with this woman, what she was doing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=54.0s)]
*  And when he took that walk over to the back of the presidential library, that's when the thieves struck at the front of the presidential library. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=66.0s)]
*  The front doors of the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library were made of glass. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=76.0s)]
*  While that security guard was at the back of the library, the other end of the building, looking out at this woman in the parking lot who was apparently there to create a diversion while he was on the other side of the building, two thieves came and smashed in the glass of the front doors of the library. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=82.0s)]
*  It was very loud. It caused a huge commotion. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=98.0s)]
*  The security guard came running. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=101.0s)]
*  The security guard then heard more glass smashing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=103.0s)]
*  But they apparently knew what they were after. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=108.0s)]
*  And it went very fast. They were in and out before anybody could catch them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=110.0s)]
*  The curator later told the Kansas City Star the whole heist took less than a minute. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=114.0s)]
*  By the time the security guard got back to where those guys had broken in, all that was left was a bunch of broken glass and footprints in the snow. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=119.0s)]
*  Turns out what they were after were these. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=129.0s)]
*  Look at all these big old swords and daggers. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=134.0s)]
*  A little known fact about the Harry Truman presidency is that he apparently loved this stuff. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=138.0s)]
*  When he was president, he was given as as gifts, a bunch of these things. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=144.0s)]
*  It was nothing inappropriate about it. He didn't keep them for himself. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=149.0s)]
*  He handed them over to the National Archives. They were put on display at his presidential library and museum. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=152.0s)]
*  Look, here's the FBI wanted poster offering a reward of up to ten thousand dollars for the information leading to the recovery of these swords stolen stolen from the Truman presidential library or the arrest and conviction of the individuals responsible. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=157.0s)]
*  There's an actual FBI wanted poster for the swords and daggers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=171.0s)]
*  And here, if you want even more detail, here's the whole website version of the wanted poster, not just pictures, but detailed description of the swords and the daggers. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=176.0s)]
*  And all the jewels and the origins of them with information about how to report information about it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=187.0s)]
*  If you come across any of these things and this website is at the website of the National Archives because it turns out the National Archives, your National Archives, our National Archives as Americans, they've got a detective unit. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=192.0s)]
*  Their inspector general's office has an investigations unit and they specifically have an archival recovery program full of investigators who do detective work to go capture people who mess with the National Archives and steal stuff from the National Archives. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=208.0s)]
*  So they've got like a cold case squad on the heist of Harry Truman's bedazzled sword and dagger collection. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=226.0s)]
*  People disparage like a history degree. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=234.0s)]
*  One of the things you could do with just the right history degree and just the right set of skills is you could grow up to be a history cop who busts people for pilfering stuff or messing with stuff in the National Archives of the United States. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=236.0s)]
*  What the world is your oyster? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=247.0s)]
*  That's the coolest job in the entire world. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=250.0s)]
*  Politico.com has just reported that those cops are the cops on the case, at least on part of the case, of the Republicans who forged fake documents after the 2020 election, asserting that they were the real electors from their states when they were not the real electors from their states. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=255.0s)]
*  We have been closely covering this weird story of Republicans in multiple states who created forged documents to say they were electors when they were not. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=274.0s)]
*  Kyle Cheney and Nicholas Wu at Politico.com have now reported that in pursuing that story themselves, and they've done groundbreaking work on that story, they have obtained records indicating that National Archives investigators have pursued a case of potential fraud against a slate of would-be Trump electors in the state of Arizona. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=286.0s)]
*  An Archives Inspector General official said the agency declined to comment on, quote, ongoing work. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=305.0s)]
*  Ongoing work? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=313.0s)]
*  We know that the Attorneys General in New Mexico and in Michigan have referred to federal prosecutors, have referred to U.S. attorneys in those states, these Republicans who forged fake elector documents so they could potentially be criminally prosecuted at the federal level. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=315.0s)]
*  We don't know if those referrals will ultimately result in federal prosecutions, but that's what the Attorneys General are asking for in those states. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=330.0s)]
*  We know that in at least one of those states in Michigan, the Attorney General there, Dana Nessel, has said if the feds don't pursue charges against those Republican fake electors, the state will pursue state charges against them. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=336.0s)]
*  But apparently there's yet another option being pursued as an ongoing matter by the cops at the National Archives, by the investigators at the National Archives, involving one of the two sets of forged documents sent in to the National Archives by Arizona. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=348.0s)]
*  Republicans pretending to be electors when in fact they were not. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=365.0s)]
*  Tell me more. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=370.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Michael J. Moore. He is the former U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia. He has tried cases in front of the judge who will oversee the special grand jury process in Fulton County. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=373.0s)]
*  Mr. Moore, it's a real pleasure to have you with us tonight. Thanks for making time. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=382.0s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be with you. Thanks for having me. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=385.0s)]
*  It does seem like this approval from the courts to seat the special grand jury, it came fairly quickly. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=389.0s)]
*  We were just reporting last week on the request to the courts made by District Attorney Willis. They've responded already. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=396.0s)]
*  I understand that means that they had to essentially pull all the judges in the county and a majority of them had to, the Superior Court judges in the county, and a majority of them had to approve this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=403.0s)]
*  That approval seems to have come fairly quickly. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=413.0s)]
*  That said, in terms of the timeline, this special grand jury isn't actually going to be seated until the beginning of May. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=415.0s)]
*  I was curious about the quickness with which they acted and the delay until the grand jury actually is seated. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=421.0s)]
*  Do you have any way to help us understand that? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=429.0s)]
*  Sure. So we've got 20 Superior Court judges that sit in Fulton County. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=432.0s)]
*  So a majority of those judges would have to have approved the application to have the special grand jury. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=436.0s)]
*  That's sort of indicated in Judge Brasher's order when he said, you know, the majority have in fact authorized this grand jury. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=442.0s)]
*  I don't put a lot of stock in the date. That could be something as simple as the scheduling of the judge who will oversee this grand jury. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=449.0s)]
*  He may have a trial going on in April that's going to take the entire month and he's doing pretrial in March. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=456.0s)]
*  I mean, we just don't know what that might be. So I don't necessarily put a lot of stock in it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=462.0s)]
*  It may also be to make sure that they get the summonses out and do those things necessary to bring in a special grand jury in this case. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=467.0s)]
*  So I don't know that I see it as something that puts up a red flag. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=474.0s)]
*  I will tell you that I think it's interesting under the special grand jury statute, though, that a lot of authority is given to the judge that oversees the special grand jury. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=478.0s)]
*  And the statute actually provides if you read a little further down, it actually says that it's until a report is issued or until the judge who is overseeing the grand jury decides that they're through. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=487.0s)]
*  So, you know, you have to question at some point, may there be some decision made there? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=498.0s)]
*  And at that point, he makes a report back to the chief judge who then has to tell the other judges. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=502.0s)]
*  And it kind of goes through a review at that point. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=506.0s)]
*  And they can ask that other work be done and other witnesses be questioned, those kinds of things very specific. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=511.0s)]
*  But it does vest a good deal of power in the judge that oversees the case. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=516.0s)]
*  I know that you have you have tried cases, or at least I've been told that you have tried cases in front of the judge who is going to have that supervisory role here. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=522.0s)]
*  Is there anything that we should know about the judge and his reputation and his capabilities, how he's viewed by his peers? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=529.0s)]
*  You know, I've had cases where he's been the judge. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=535.0s)]
*  I've not tried a case in front of him. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=538.0s)]
*  I think he's a good judge. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=541.0s)]
*  He's a thorough judge. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=542.0s)]
*  But you know, he's he's a Republican appointee and I don't say that as if it's some kind of bad mark against him. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=544.0s)]
*  But I mean, that's that's just the reality of it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=550.0s)]
*  And so I think he'll be thorough. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=553.0s)]
*  And I think he has a probably a good understanding based on his time as an assistant U.S. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=555.0s)]
*  attorney, you know, in what what cases look like, where they're complex. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=559.0s)]
*  But there's also, you know, U.S. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=564.0s)]
*  attorneys are also taught that you look for the most severe, readily approvable offense that you can have when you're moving forward with the case. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=566.0s)]
*  And that's one thing I've really been pushing for here. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=573.0s)]
*  And that is I don't know that we need a special grand jury. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=575.0s)]
*  I mean, we've got the secretary of state has written a book about what happened. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=578.0s)]
*  So it's not really a secret about what went on. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=582.0s)]
*  Plus, we have this recorded telephone call. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=585.0s)]
*  You know, it's not exactly I know he's Secretary Ravensburger has said he's not going to come without a summons. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=587.0s)]
*  You know, it's not exactly a profile encouraged to sell a book, but then refused to come forward to a grand jury who's trying to look into the allegations that you wrote your book about. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=592.0s)]
*  But you know, that being said, I think in this case, you know, the district attorney could take a very rifle shot approach at the case. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=601.0s)]
*  And that serves a lot of you know, there's a lot of benefit to that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=609.0s)]
*  I mean, on the one hand, moves the case quickly. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=612.0s)]
*  On the other hand, it avoids some problems that may come down the road with appellate courts in this state that are controlled by, you know, Republican appointees, some friends of mine and some good people. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=615.0s)]
*  And I'm not suggesting that that means the case goes one way or another. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=627.0s)]
*  But you know, if you if you have a doubt about how things might come out, I mean, tell me how things are going at the U.S. Supreme Court now, you know, based on who's got the majority in the court. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=630.0s)]
*  So those are things to consider. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=641.0s)]
*  I also think it would be smart because, you know, think about the benefit of a sniper attack. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=643.0s)]
*  You do a quick shot, you know, you kind of are hidden in the bushes and you've got the case going as opposed to driving up to the enemy camp in a school bus and giving them a big target to shoot at. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=648.0s)]
*  So it's just different approaches. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=658.0s)]
*  And I certainly have a lot of respect for the district attorney and don't want to second guess her. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=660.0s)]
*  I certainly don't want to be calling shots from the from the cheap seats here. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=664.0s)]
*  But I do think there's a case to be made for treating this like any other criminal case. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=667.0s)]
*  You know, slap the Trump indictment if you choose to indict him, just put him in front of a regular criminal grand jury, you know, slap him in between somebody accused of sexual assault and somebody accused of fraud. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=672.0s)]
*  That seems probably a pretty good place to have his hit his case heard and see if the grand jury wants to issue an indictment. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=683.0s)]
*  They're not there to listen to all the evidence. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=689.0s)]
*  You don't have to put all of your case forward. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=692.0s)]
*  You don't have to present your case beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=694.0s)]
*  You're just establishing probable cause. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=697.0s)]
*  So with the citizens of Fulton County make a decision based on testimony that a prosecutor felt like was enough to establish probable cause that a crime had been committed, would they then issue an indictment and move the case forward to trial? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=699.0s)]
*  So I think there's some considerations that could still be looked at. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=712.0s)]
*  My guess is that she's doing this to maybe expand her investigation, to look at other people. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=715.0s)]
*  She may be looking at people that were involved in the telephone call, the scheduling or other people who made calls to the state officials as well. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=721.0s)]
*  But, you know, I do think there's a way to move the case a great deal more quickly and with some efficiency that might help as well. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=729.0s)]
*  Over the weekend, the Arizona Democratic Party made an incredibly took an incredibly rare step to rebuke Senator Sinema. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=740.0s)]
*  They officially censured her for her role in helping Republicans stop that voting rights bill. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=749.0s)]
*  The head of the Arizona Democratic Party said in a statement, quote, The ramifications of failing to pass federal legislation that protects our constituents right to vote are too large and far reaching. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=756.0s)]
*  While we take no pleasure in this announcement, the Arizona Democratic Party executive board has decided to formally censure Senator Sinema as a result of her failure to do whatever it takes to ensure the health of our democracy. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=766.0s)]
*  We do not see this from Democratic parties. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=780.0s)]
*  We do not see this very often at all from state Democratic parties about an incumbent Democratic member of Congress, let alone the United States Senate. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=783.0s)]
*  It is something we're used to seeing in Republican Party politics recently, particularly in this schismatic era of the Republican Party becoming the Trump Party and Trump's takeover has led to many attempts to exile Republicans who don't pledge, you know, full fealty to him. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=792.0s)]
*  So we've seen a lot of this on the Republican side. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=807.0s)]
*  Democrats rarely, if ever, take this kind of an action, this kind of action against an incumbent. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=810.0s)]
*  Well, now tonight, there's something new. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=816.0s)]
*  Tonight we can report exclusively that one of the nation's largest and most effective Latino grassroots organizations vote Latino is announcing a big ad campaign to unseat Kirsten Sinema in her next primary and get her out of the United States Senate. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=818.0s)]
*  They've launched a new website. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=835.0s)]
*  It's called Adios cinema.org. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=836.0s)]
*  Senator Sinema is not up for reelection for another two years. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=840.0s)]
*  We still have an entire midterm election before voters will even get the chance to cast a ballot against her. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=844.0s)]
*  But Arizona Democrats and national progressive groups and now this very influential Latino voters group. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=849.0s)]
*  They are preparing for that fight. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=855.0s)]
*  I did not expect it to go this direction, but it has with an exclamation point. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=857.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Maria Teresa Kumar. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=861.0s)]
*  She is president and CEO of Voto Latino. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=864.0s)]
*  Maria Teresa, it's really nice to see you. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=866.0s)]
*  Thanks for making time. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=868.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=869.0s)]
*  So I don't mean to put Voto Latino and Indivisible in the same box. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=871.0s)]
*  Everybody has a different remit, a different mission and a different approach to these politics. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=875.0s)]
*  I do, however, think that Voto Latino under your leadership and Indivisible under Ezra's leadership and others, both share a very practical been there, done that experienced approach to politics. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=879.0s)]
*  That's why it seems like a big deal to me. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=891.0s)]
*  It seems like it must have been a hard decision to take a big stand like this against a serving Democratic senator and what amounts to a very swingy state. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=894.0s)]
*  Arizona is a very swingy state. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=903.0s)]
*  And what was able to get Sinema over to the top to go to the Senate was literally the Latino vote. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=906.0s)]
*  And Rachel, we did not make this decision lightly. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=914.0s)]
*  We had conference calls. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=917.0s)]
*  We spoke to our board. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=919.0s)]
*  We spoke to individuals. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=920.0s)]
*  We engaged and we engaged with Senator Sinema. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=921.0s)]
*  We were very clear on the day of the vote where we stood and what we needed her to do. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=924.0s)]
*  We had her back when she needed us, the Latino community. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=929.0s)]
*  And she demonstrated that even though Arizona was ground zero for the big lie, the big audit that was fabricated, that was not true. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=932.0s)]
*  She did not take seriously this idea that voting is the essence. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=941.0s)]
*  As in as the president said, the threshold of our democracy where millions of Arizona and Latinos will be disenfranchised, millions of Americans across the country. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=945.0s)]
*  If we do not have fair, free elections at the federal level, where everybody, regardless of party, is playing by the same rules. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=954.0s)]
*  Has Senator Sinema been willing to engage with you, with Voto Latino, with other groups that have had such a problem with her recent voting record and her recent actions on issues like this? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=962.0s)]
*  Has she been willing to talk? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=973.0s)]
*  She did on the very day that we were the big vote on the filibuster, whether or not we were even going to bring this to the floor. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=976.0s)]
*  We had a conversation. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=983.0s)]
*  We engaged with her, myself and several other Latino leaders. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=984.0s)]
*  And she referred to us to the 20 minute speech that she made and said that she was very clear and we were clear that we needed to make sure that we are all eligible to participate in our democracy. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=988.0s)]
*  And again, everybody has a different perspective on what we should be doing. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1000.0s)]
*  Absolutely. But when you look at the ramifications of what's happening at the state level on the rights of individuals, of young people, of people of color, it is disproportionately the Republican Party who is hell-bent on making sure that not everybody has equal access. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1005.0s)]
*  Last year, in 2020, Rachel, we had all 50 states. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1022.0s)]
*  Regardless of political stripes, every single secretary of state verified a fair and free election. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1027.0s)]
*  But it was the people who voted. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1032.0s)]
*  It was young people, it was people of color, Latinos, African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans that voted in record number. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1033.0s)]
*  This multi-generational America that came together to oust Trump, very clearly saying we want a different direction of our country. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1039.0s)]
*  And instead of Republicans celebrating this, instead of cinema making sure that we can do this again, she is the first person that is basically the obstacle to ensure and get rid of the filibuster and have access to the voting booth and ensure there are democracy. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1046.0s)]
*  Little D democracy continues to thrive. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1060.0s)]
*  In terms of Big D Democrats versus Small D democracy, I was looking at some of the polling for Senator Sinema at home, and it's terrible. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1062.0s)]
*  One recent poll found that it was a poll of Arizona Democrats. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1072.0s)]
*  Seventy-two percent of Arizona Democrats would prefer that there was a different candidate for her seat than her next time around. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1076.0s)]
*  Another poll found that the best case scenario for her would be a very crowded primary for her seat, and in a very crowded primary, she would still lose the primary by four points. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1083.0s)]
*  If I'm Senator Sinema's campaign staff, political staff, and I'm looking at those kind of numbers among Arizona Democrats, and I'm looking at audiosinema.org, I'm looking at this website that you've put up in this ad campaign that you're starting, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1093.0s)]
*  and the kind of similar arguments that we're hearing from so many people that represents key constituents that helped get her elected the last time, I might bail on the Democratic Party. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1107.0s)]
*  Become a Republican, potentially, I guess. Become an independent. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1117.0s)]
*  Try to do this, the Lisa Murkowski path, where you maybe don't fit in with the state party, but you try to hold on to your seat anyway. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1121.0s)]
*  Do you think that's a possibility? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1128.0s)]
*  So the Lisa Murkowski model, the difference is that you don't have a large ethnic population where she's from. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1130.0s)]
*  In Arizona, 30 percent of the electoral base is Latino, and by the time that Senator Sinema is once again on the ballot, you're going to have 162,000 newly-minted eligible voters that have just turned 18 within the last four years. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1137.0s)]
*  The fact that, and just to remind viewers, President Biden won Arizona by less than 12,000 votes. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1152.0s)]
*  These are absolutely opportunities at the margins, and it's going to, as anything, it's a contested primary, it opens up the field to find new dynamic voices that really serve the interests of the Arizona people. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1159.0s)]
*  We have to remind folks that it wasn't just the filibuster, but the filibuster, if we cannot access the voting booth, everything else that Arizonans say that they care about, whether it's the environment because they don't have water, whether it's access to health care, whether it's access to fair minimum wage, none of that is possible because there's an obstructionist government right now that is being held by the minority party, that is being espoused by the minority of Americans, not the majority of Americans in this case. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1172.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFFUldstMvE&t=1202.0s)]
