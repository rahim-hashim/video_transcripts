# Watch the full video: Rachel Maddow interviews Yulia Navalnaya
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU)
*  In 2013, so 11 years ago, Donald Trump posted on Twitter about hosting the Miss Universe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=0.0s)]
*  pageant in Moscow. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=8.72s)]
*  He said online, quote, Do you think Putin will go to the pageant? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  If so, will he become my new best friend? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=15.82s)]
*  What was that about? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=19.16s)]
*  What grown man talks that way about anyone, let alone the president of Russia? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=21.94s)]
*  But that was 2013. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=26.8s)]
*  Two years later, Donald Trump entered the Republican primary contest for president on [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=27.92s)]
*  the night of the third presidential primary debate. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=32.96s)]
*  We later learned that that same night he secretly signed a letter of intent to build Trump Tower [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=36.88s)]
*  Moscow, which would have been the biggest real estate project of his entire life. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  He lied about that and kept that secret throughout the campaign. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=48.1s)]
*  We didn't learn about it until after he had been elected president. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=51.08s)]
*  While he was president, he insisted on meeting one on one with Vladimir Putin without any [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=56.16s)]
*  American staff present. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=60.919999999999995s)]
*  And he did so on at least five different occasions. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  And at least one of those instances in a 2017 meeting in Germany, Trump personally confiscated [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  the notes that had been taken at that meeting by his own interpreter. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=72.96s)]
*  Since leaving the presidency, Bob Woodward now reports that Trump has continued to have [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  secret one on one communications with Vladimir Putin, not only refusing to report his communications [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=82.16s)]
*  to the U.S. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=87.88s)]
*  Government, which is arguably illegal anyway, but he's also not been allowing even his own [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=88.88s)]
*  staff to be nearby when he speaks with Putin. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  What about his communications with Putin needs to be so secret? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=100.56s)]
*  Putin's government, of course, interfered in the U.S. election in 2016 to try to help [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump get elected in the 2020 election. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=109.52s)]
*  They ran a robust foreign influence operation to try to prevent Joe Biden from becoming [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=112.14s)]
*  Trump's Democratic opponent. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=117.38s)]
*  Now in 2024, Russia is just flat out paying pro-Trump conservative commentators in the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=119.58s)]
*  United States as part of yet another large Russian state sponsored effort to try to help [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=125.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=131.18s)]
*  We have a hard time in the United States calling whatever is going on with Donald Trump and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=135.16s)]
*  the Republican Party. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=140.58s)]
*  We have a hard time calling it authoritarianism. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=141.74s)]
*  We get nervous about the word, the idea of authoritarianism. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=145.06s)]
*  We get nervous about what that might mean here in a domestic context. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=149.18s)]
*  But we can all at least agree that Trump does have some kind of weird freaking relationship, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  a servile, almost worshipful relationship with somebody who everyone in America can [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=160.58s)]
*  agree is an authoritarian, if not a fascist dictator. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=166.3s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=171.42s)]
*  And that admiration that Trump has for Putin is as inexplicable as ever. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=173.98s)]
*  It's undimmed by the passing of years. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=181.34s)]
*  And more explicitly now than ever before, it extends not just to Trump personally wanting [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=183.9s)]
*  Putin to like him, personally, seemingly, Trump wanting to be like Putin. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=189.26s)]
*  But now it explicitly seems to extend to Trump wanting our country, the United States, to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=194.5s)]
*  be more like Russia is under Putin's control. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=200.86s)]
*  So in this campaign for president, what we hear from Trump is that news organizations [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=204.9s)]
*  should not be allowed to air criticism of him or to air interviews with his opponents. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=209.74s)]
*  He will shut those news organizations down when he's back in power. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=214.9s)]
*  We hear from him that Democratic politicians should not be allowed to run against him. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=219.24s)]
*  And they're all criminals. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=224.22000000000003s)]
*  We hear from him that portions of the U.S. Constitution should be terminated. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=225.58s)]
*  We hear from him that businesses that don't do what he wants will be crushed when he is [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=229.54s)]
*  back in power. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=233.5s)]
*  He says, let's withdraw from NATO. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=234.9s)]
*  Let's let Russia do, quote, whatever the hell it wants to our allies. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=237.22s)]
*  Let's use the military against American civilians who dare to protest against him. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=243.1s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has been in power in Russia for 25 years. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  Russia is the largest country in the world. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=254.98s)]
*  It has almost infinite economic potential, particularly during this last 25 years. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=257.18s)]
*  It is a country of fantastic natural resources, an almost unparalleled legacy of cultural [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=262.9s)]
*  and scientific achievement, a country whose enemies, frankly, mostly dissolved with the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  dissolution of the Soviet Union. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=275.88s)]
*  The horizons were endless, possibilities limitless. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=279.3s)]
*  But under Vladimir Putin, Russia, again, a country that covers a tenth of the world's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=283.86s)]
*  land mass, Russia has an economy smaller than Italy's. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=288.90000000000003s)]
*  Russia's per capita GDP is lower than Bulgaria, lower than Mexico, lower than Guyana. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=293.5s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=299.26s)]
*  Well, while Russia languishes as a country, its criminal elite connected to Putin, they [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=301.18s)]
*  buy up luxury real estate and yachts and private jets and vineyards and resorts and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=308.66s)]
*  private islands all over the world, including here. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=314.38000000000005s)]
*  And Putin himself, long rumored to be the world's richest man, he builds himself palaces [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=319.38000000000005s)]
*  like this one on the Black Sea. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=325.16s)]
*  Authoritarianism isn't just a textbook term in political science. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=329.5s)]
*  And it isn't just dystopian, right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=336.9s)]
*  It isn't just cruel and repressive. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=339.06s)]
*  It is also always corrupt and therefore pitiful. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=341.34s)]
*  And everyone in the world deserves better. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=346.53999999999996s)]
*  And in a better world, it would not be Vladimir Putin right now. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=349.94s)]
*  It would be this man who would be the president of Russia, the head of the Anti-Corruption [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=353.62s)]
*  Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Russia, a man who made that video that I just showed [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=358.94s)]
*  you, showing Putin's secret palace on the Black Sea, along with so many other damning [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=365.41999999999996s)]
*  and incredibly newsworthy and incredibly well-researched investigative reports on the secret wealth [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=371.53999999999996s)]
*  of Putin and his henchmen who have spent the last 25 years robbing that country blind. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  His name is Alexei Navalny, and he is the most effective and inspiring opposition figure [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=383.78s)]
*  of modern Russia. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=389.85999999999996s)]
*  And Alexei Navalny's leadership has been characterized by a refusal to be afraid, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=391.86s)]
*  a relentless sense of humor, and an even more relentless commitment to the certainty that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=398.22s)]
*  Putin's regime will end, that there will be a Russia without Putin, that it's inevitable [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=406.78000000000003s)]
*  that the lies will collapse in on themselves, that the party of crooks and thieves, Putin's [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=412.74s)]
*  party will finally be thrown out, the inevitable certainty that democracy is coming. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=417.78s)]
*  They started arresting Alexei Navalny in 2011, and they never really stopped. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=425.61999999999995s)]
*  They tried to blind him in chemical attacks twice. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  They banned him from running for office. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=437.26s)]
*  They banned his organization. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=439.73999999999995s)]
*  They ultimately gave it the same classification as Al-Qaeda and ISIS. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=441.09999999999997s)]
*  They arrested and imprisoned his younger brother. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=446.06s)]
*  They arrested his colleagues. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=449.74s)]
*  They arrested even his lawyers. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=451.34s)]
*  And then this year, this February, they killed him in prison. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=454.26s)]
*  His wife, Yulia, survives him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=459.4s)]
*  They've now put out an arrest warrant for her as well. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=461.54s)]
*  She lives in exile because she has to. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=464.78s)]
*  Alexei Navalny was the man who should be the president of a free, democratic Russia right [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=467.22s)]
*  now in 2024. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=472.7s)]
*  After his death now, instead, it should be his wife. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=474.62s)]
*  In some ways, it is his wife, Yulia Navalny, continuing the investigations into the corruption [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=479.3s)]
*  of the authoritarian regime that still rules her country, leading not yet a government, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=484.3s)]
*  but for now, the people of that country who aren't just yearning to be free from that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=490.5s)]
*  stupid kleptocratic dictatorship, but leading the people who are actively working to get [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=495.94s)]
*  free and to prepare to live in a democracy instead, because the certainty remains that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=502.70000000000005s)]
*  it is coming. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=507.5s)]
*  And for us, for people all around the world, including here in the United States, who aren't [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=510.86s)]
*  trying to overthrow a dictatorship, who instead are trying to stop the authoritarian takeover [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=516.5400000000001s)]
*  of our existing democratic system. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=522.34s)]
*  Well, this woman, this Yulia Navalny, seems like one of the most important people in the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=525.22s)]
*  world who we could meet at the crossroads. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=529.86s)]
*  Yulia Navalny is a Russian opposition leader. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=534.1s)]
*  She is the wife, now the widow of Alexei Navalny. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=536.02s)]
*  Navalny's secret prison diaries and his memoir are somehow miraculously being published this [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=538.62s)]
*  week. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=545.26s)]
*  The book is called Patriot, a memoir. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=546.26s)]
*  I read every word of the book. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=547.82s)]
*  I could not put it down. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=549.26s)]
*  Yulia Navalny, it is a real honor to have you here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=551.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=553.7s)]
*  Hello, Rachel. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=554.7s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=555.7s)]
*  It's a great honor and thank you for your kind words. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=557.5400000000001s)]
*  Did I say anything that rubbed you the wrong way or that seemed wrong to you? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=560.5400000000001s)]
*  Oh, you know, you said too many good words in advance, I guess, some of them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=563.5s)]
*  But thank you. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=570.94s)]
*  I will tell you, we're in the midst of a very heated election season in this country, as [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=572.58s)]
*  you know. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=577.9000000000001s)]
*  And my confession to you is that I did not intend to read all of the book. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=579.0200000000001s)]
*  I thought, I am not going to have time. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=583.1400000000001s)]
*  I'm really busy. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=584.94s)]
*  I'm going to read the beginning and the end, have other people read it and tell me what [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=586.1800000000001s)]
*  it's about. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=588.6600000000001s)]
*  I read every word of it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=589.6600000000001s)]
*  I couldn't stop reading it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=590.6600000000001s)]
*  I found it incredibly moving. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=591.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=593.1400000000001s)]
*  Can you tell me a little bit about what it took to get the book into print? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=595.74s)]
*  I imagine that you had to have a hand in editing the manuscript. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=600.7800000000001s)]
*  I imagine there may have been some hard decisions for you in terms of things that felt personal [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=605.1400000000001s)]
*  that you might have wanted to keep between you and your husband that you nevertheless [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=610.34s)]
*  put in the book. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  What was it like to bring it to fruition? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=614.38s)]
*  It's very important for me. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=616.66s)]
*  This book is memory of my husband, his legacy. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=618.42s)]
*  And that's why it was difficult in some ways to put some parts together. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=624.58s)]
*  But I would say to you that we didn't cut a lot in editing. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=635.1s)]
*  No, I think that everything that was in this book, it was true. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=640.9000000000001s)]
*  And I wanted to keep Alex's voice to sound loud and to sound open and his voice to bring [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=645.3000000000001s)]
*  the truth. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=656.98s)]
*  When he writes in the book about sort of spontaneously saying to a crowd of people that is assembled [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=659.0600000000001s)]
*  when he's been arrested, he's in trouble with the law, nobody knows what's going to happen [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=665.3000000000001s)]
*  to him. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=668.58s)]
*  He writes how he sort of surprised himself by saying, don't be afraid of anything. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=670.5400000000001s)]
*  He writes about it as if that kind of burst out of him. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=675.1s)]
*  And he was happy that it burst out of him. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=677.5s)]
*  It's something that he'd been feeling, but he hadn't articulated that way. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=679.46s)]
*  I think people in this country, certainly people around the world, indelibly think of [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=682.62s)]
*  him with that sentiment, not only because we know what ultimately happened to him, because [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=688.1800000000001s)]
*  long before they killed him, we knew what they were doing to him. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=693.5400000000001s)]
*  For him to not be afraid himself, but to tell other people, this is the secret. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=697.94s)]
*  This is the way out of repression. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=702.7s)]
*  This is the way to beat a dictator, to not be afraid of him. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=705.26s)]
*  Do you know where he learned that? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=709.38s)]
*  It seems like you believe it too. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=711.82s)]
*  Did the two of you come up with it? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=713.38s)]
*  I believe in it, but of course I would like to know more of his secrets, because he had [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=714.94s)]
*  a superpower in some ways, and he was so easily able to motivate people and to encourage people. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=722.7s)]
*  Probably the secret is just to be honest with people, to be close to people, to love people, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=733.34s)]
*  to believe in what you are doing, and just to follow this direction and to follow your [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=740.22s)]
*  inner rules. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=745.9s)]
*  And it's very important to do this. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=747.3s)]
*  To love country, to love family, to love the things you are doing. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=752.02s)]
*  Not to go to the office, just to go to the office every day doing your job, just to live [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=764.46s)]
*  in this job, with this job, with these beliefs. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=771.5s)]
*  I think that it was for him not very hard, because he believed in everything what he [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=776.5s)]
*  was doing. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=783.02s)]
*  One of the things he writes about that's very moving is how much your support meant to him, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=785.3s)]
*  and how much it made him more capable as a leader and as an activist to know that you [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=793.58s)]
*  were with him, that you agreed with him, that you already agreed with him before he'd ever [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=799.78s)]
*  had a chance to talk to you about it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=804.06s)]
*  He talks about it very movingly when he's been poisoned with a nerve agent. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=806.6999999999999s)]
*  He's got nearly three weeks in a coma in Germany. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=810.8199999999999s)]
*  They very nearly kill him. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=816.1s)]
*  And he writes movingly about how your presence was a neurobiological miracle. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=818.22s)]
*  It was the only thing that brought him back. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=823.66s)]
*  And the thing that I thought about that, preparing to talk to you today, is that in many ways [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=826.3199999999999s)]
*  you've stepped into his shoes. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=830.24s)]
*  You're the leader of the Russian opposition, because he can't be anymore. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=832.38s)]
*  But who can be that role for you? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=837.46s)]
*  Who can support you the way that you supported him? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=839.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=842.78s)]
*  Everything what you are saying is a compliment, and it's very nice to hear it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=844.9s)]
*  I think you call me the leader of opposition a little bit in advance. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=851.9399999999999s)]
*  I would call myself a young politician probably in some ways. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=855.9s)]
*  Of course, I knew about politics a lot, because I've been living with the leader, a real leader [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=859.7s)]
*  of opposition for many years. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=865.62s)]
*  But I promise I will do my best. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=869.46s)]
*  And it's very important for me in many reasons, and for my country, and for my family, and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=873.26s)]
*  for my children, and for Alexis Mamoury, who support me. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=879.38s)]
*  I think that it's the main problem, because of course we supported each other. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=884.5799999999999s)]
*  And it was very easy for him, and very easy for me in some very difficult moments, because [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=891.5s)]
*  after all these searches, we can go to lie down on the bed just touching our hands. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=901.9s)]
*  And it was very helpful. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=910.5799999999999s)]
*  But I miss it a lot. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=914.4599999999999s)]
*  And I'm doing all these interviews, meetings, and everything. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=916.66s)]
*  What I wish a lot, to come back home every evening and to discuss everything with him. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=924.14s)]
*  Even when he was in prison, to write him a letter telling what's going on in my life. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=932.62s)]
*  But still, I think that love to him, love to country, all the supporters who supported [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=938.66s)]
*  Alexei and who support me now, they give me power. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=952.38s)]
*  And I appreciate all these kind words, a lot of letters of support from many, many people. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=958.82s)]
*  Even since Alexei was killed earlier this year, even since they first started arresting [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=968.82s)]
*  him, as I described in 2011, and since the Ukraine war has served as a pretext to increasingly [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=976.42s)]
*  ratchet up the punishment for dissent in Russia, I feel like even on that timeframe, the repression [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=988.5s)]
*  right now of independent media, dissent, political opposition in Russia is cranked down tighter [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=995.5s)]
*  than I've ever seen it in the last 25 years. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1001.62s)]
*  That the repression in particular of the media just feels total. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1005.46s)]
*  And so while the Anti-Corruption Foundation continues doing its work, while the opposition [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1011.1s)]
*  continues doing its work, while you still try to find ways for people to express their [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1015.22s)]
*  resistance to the Putin regime, looking from the outside, I don't see how you do it, because [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1019.5s)]
*  I don't see that anybody has any space to operate without putting themselves in grave [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1024.78s)]
*  danger. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1029.54s)]
*  And it just seems like there are so few people who have the kind of superhuman courage and [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1030.54s)]
*  bravery that your husband represented. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1034.54s)]
*  How do you work in that repressive environment? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1037.82s)]
*  You're right. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1039.8999999999999s)]
*  There are no independent media inside Russia at all. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1041.18s)]
*  All newspapers are closed, all sites and so on, which were independent inside Russia, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1044.98s)]
*  they are closed. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1053.98s)]
*  All these editors and all journalists are in exile. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1055.06s)]
*  And it's very important to remember that there are no at all independent media inside Russia [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1060.14s)]
*  by now. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1065.46s)]
*  I understand that while we're here in the United States discussing this, it's difficult [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1066.46s)]
*  to believe. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1071.16s)]
*  Probably two or three of them can work in some ways. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1072.16s)]
*  No. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1077.22s)]
*  The media is in exile and a lot of journalists are called foreign agents. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1078.3s)]
*  Part of our organization is called extremists, me extremist as well, by the way. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1087.62s)]
*  There's an arrest warrant out in Russia. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1097.62s)]
*  And it's very difficult to have any communication with people, because any connection with me, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1101.86s)]
*  for example, could be called like a criminal case, could be a criminal case, could be [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1108.02s)]
*  open because of this and so on. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1114.82s)]
*  But still, we are working now in exile. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1116.94s)]
*  We are based in one of all two countries and we have in Georgia, which was in Moscow, we [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1119.86s)]
*  just moved from Moscow. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1126.54s)]
*  And we continue to do everything what we did while we were in Russia. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1129.06s)]
*  We continue our anti-corruption investigations. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1135.98s)]
*  We continue our YouTube channels, which are very famous, not just now with our anti-corruption [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1139.22s)]
*  investigations, which you mentioned, but also we have account of YouTube TV. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1146.26s)]
*  So we are doing independent news every day. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1154.94s)]
*  We are doing a lot of interviews with people who are against war and Putin's regime. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1158.42s)]
*  We are doing it every day and we are trying to bring this information and we can see that [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1167.1000000000001s)]
*  mostly people in Russia watch our YouTube channels. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1172.54s)]
*  So they're seeking for this independent information because it's not possible to find anything [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1177.26s)]
*  independent on Russian TV. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1183.38s)]
*  Alexei writes in the book that when the regime started arresting him and imprisoning him, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1186.94s)]
*  he says they had two aims. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1197.02s)]
*  And the first was to hurt his ability to work. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1198.74s)]
*  He says when you're in prison, it's hard to get your work done. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1201.14s)]
*  And even when you're under house arrest, it's hard to get your work done. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1203.68s)]
*  When he was obviously a very committed candidate for office, I found it very moving that he [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1206.7s)]
*  wrote about not wanting to be a protest or symbolic candidate. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1211.06s)]
*  He wanted to be a candidate who would win. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1214.98s)]
*  He believed in democracy and wanted to make people's votes really count for something. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1216.9s)]
*  So it's to stop his work. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1221.22s)]
*  The other reason for arresting him and charging him with the things they charged him with [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1223.6200000000001s)]
*  was to undercut his message. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1227.06s)]
*  He's obviously an anti-corruption crusader, so they would charge him with things that [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1228.84s)]
*  would make him seem like, oh, he's the corrupt one. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1233.06s)]
*  It seems to me though that the other reason that they were, there's a third aim in arresting [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1236.6200000000001s)]
*  him, which is to break down other people's will, to make an example of him so that what [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1242.0200000000002s)]
*  happened to him would scare other people, especially after what has happened to him [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1249.1000000000001s)]
*  and what has happened to the media and what has happened to the opposition and what has [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1255.6200000000001s)]
*  happened with Russia during the Ukraine war, which has made everything worse. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1258.88s)]
*  Do you still believe that the collapse of the regime is inevitable and that Russia will [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1264.0400000000002s)]
*  be democratic one day? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1268.92s)]
*  Of course. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1270.98s)]
*  How could I not believe? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1271.98s)]
*  Alexei sacrificed all his life for this, and I feel like I must continue his work. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1274.26s)]
*  I feel like I must continue what he did for many, many years. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1281.78s)]
*  It's very important for me, and I believe that, you know, all these changes, they very [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1289.3s)]
*  often happen in one day. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1296.22s)]
*  It doesn't mean that we need to sit down and chair and to wait them one day to another [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1298.26s)]
*  day. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1304.62s)]
*  Of course, we need to do something, but it doesn't mean that we need to expect from [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1305.62s)]
*  people to do every day huge things, just to do every day something small to encourage [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1311.18s)]
*  people, to motivate people, to show them that we are all together against this regime, against [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1320.8999999999999s)]
*  war, against Putin especially. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1329.46s)]
*  And we are together in this aim. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1333.4199999999998s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1335.54s)]
*  So absolutely, I believe. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1336.54s)]
*  And I don't promise you that it happened tomorrow. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1339.22s)]
*  And we know that it could take years. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1343.3799999999999s)]
*  I absolutely understand it. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1346.86s)]
*  But from others' hand, how to live if not to believe in good changes. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1349.22s)]
*  As an American, I feel guilty that my government and my country was not able to do more to [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1357.14s)]
*  stop what they did to your husband. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1364.46s)]
*  And I feel not necessarily guilty, but frustrated and angry that we haven't been able to do [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1368.58s)]
*  stop Putin from doing what he's done to the Russian people and now to the Ukrainian people [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1375.1000000000001s)]
*  and beyond. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1381.5800000000002s)]
*  What could America do that we haven't done? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1384.0200000000002s)]
*  What could America do to support effective opposition to his regime? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1387.18s)]
*  What could America do more? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1392.74s)]
*  What else could America have done to prevent the murder of your husband? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1396.66s)]
*  I don't want to blame anyone for this. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1400.38s)]
*  Because it's Vladimir Putin who killed my husband, nobody else. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1404.26s)]
*  But if to take a look at the past, I think that all the governments, democratic governments, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1409.62s)]
*  were playing with Putin for many years, a kind of game. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1416.26s)]
*  Trying to negotiate with him, seeking connections with him, waiting probably that one day he [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1421.5s)]
*  will become one of them, a kind of normal. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1429.14s)]
*  But the one thing which they didn't notice and which we must remember that Putin always [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1433.6200000000001s)]
*  lied. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1442.22s)]
*  And I think that government and officials, governments and officials, they just missed [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1443.5s)]
*  this moment. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1451.5400000000002s)]
*  So Putin was trying year by year to move these borders and to... [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1452.58s)]
*  He was doing awful things, more and more awful, and everybody was sitting and waiting. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1461.7s)]
*  Probably the next day he will stop. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1470.46s)]
*  But we need to remember that he never stopped. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1475.26s)]
*  Of course, it was a mistake that all this pressure on Putin has started just after the [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1477.9s)]
*  war in Ukraine has started. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1490.38s)]
*  I apologize for asking you an American-centered question, but we have this big, very high-stakes [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1497.3400000000001s)]
*  election right now. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1503.8200000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1505.3000000000002s)]
*  You're aware. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1506.46s)]
*  I know. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1507.46s)]
*  I do think that the relationship, the sort of admiration that the Republican candidate [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1511.1399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump has for Putin is inexplicable. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1516.8999999999999s)]
*  And it's undimmed, it hasn't changed at all. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1520.62s)]
*  I do think that he is proposing that the United States should drop our form of government [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1523.02s)]
*  and adopt something more like what Putin has done to Russia. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1527.74s)]
*  If we choose him as our president, that means that America has freely and of our own freewill [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1532.42s)]
*  electively chosen that kind of a change for us as a country. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1539.86s)]
*  And we might do it. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1544.42s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen in this election. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1545.42s)]
*  From your vantage point, how does that strike you? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1548.1s)]
*  What do you think about the fact that America may choose that as its future? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1552.18s)]
*  I hope that America will do the right choice. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1556.78s)]
*  I believe in democratic institutions. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1561.34s)]
*  I still think that. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1566.06s)]
*  I know that you have a lot of conversations, and they still work or not, but comparing [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1568.18s)]
*  to Russia, I can be just jealous that you are having such things like independent court, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1573.26s)]
*  independent media. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1582.02s)]
*  You can criticize candidates on TV. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1583.78s)]
*  And so I'm sure that America will do the right choice and everything will be fine. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1589.3s)]
*  You've had some interaction, I know, in particular with Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1597.06s)]
*  When you were named one of the world's most influential people by Time magazine, she wrote [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1601.6599999999999s)]
*  the write-up about you. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1605.6599999999999s)]
*  What have your interactions with her been like, and do you feel like she understands [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1607.26s)]
*  the stakes of what you're fighting for? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1610.98s)]
*  Last time I spoke with her on 1st of August by phone. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1613.06s)]
*  It was, she called me out, prisoner swap, which happened between America, Germany and [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1618.54s)]
*  Russia, and I really appreciated it. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1626.3s)]
*  It was very warm, very private and personal talk. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1629.3799999999999s)]
*  And she told me that she remember what my husband and my family did and are doing to [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1635.8999999999999s)]
*  make Russia a democratic country. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1645.4199999999998s)]
*  And of course, I very appreciate that exactly at this day she called me and it means for [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1648.4199999999998s)]
*  me a lot. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1653.3799999999999s)]
*  Last question for you. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1656.56s)]
*  I think it means a lot to the world that Patriot, a memoir, Alexei's prison diaries, but also [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1659.62s)]
*  his memoir are out now. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1671.3799999999999s)]
*  It's a remarkable book. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1674.28s)]
*  As I said, I did not intend to read all of it. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1675.52s)]
*  I did not have time. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1677.68s)]
*  He really messed me up. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1678.68s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1680.96s)]
*  But it took a lot to get this out into the world. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1681.96s)]
*  A lot of risk and a lot of effort. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1685.8799999999999s)]
*  And it is a remarkable document. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1688.56s)]
*  What do you want people to take away from this? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1691.16s)]
*  What do you think is the most important thing for people to know about this book? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1694.76s)]
*  There are two parts. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1699.48s)]
*  I want people to be encouraged by this book, not to give up, not continue fight because, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1700.68s)]
*  as you know, now in the world there are more and more authoritarian regimes. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1709.04s)]
*  And Alexei is a great example that people never give up. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1715.1200000000001s)]
*  Even in prison, even in torturing conditions, they continue their fight, even fight, because [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1719.8400000000001s)]
*  he was fighting even from prison. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1726.1200000000001s)]
*  But also, of course, people will know my husband, that he was a great man, that he was very [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1730.4s)]
*  kind, very funny, and very beloved person. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1738.8000000000002s)]
*  His sense of humor and his creativity, even under duress to me, is inspiring. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1746.88s)]
*  And I don't know other resistance leaders of my generation, of my time, that bring that [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1753.24s)]
*  to it in a way that really made me think in a completely different way about what it means [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1759.82s)]
*  to stand up for freedom, stand up for freedom of choice. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1764.06s)]
*  Yulia Navania, it is a real honor to have you here and I wish all the best for you. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1768.94s)]
*  I just hope doors open for you everywhere and I wish all the best for you. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1773.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1776.98s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1777.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuiVpoM-tmU&t=1778.98s)]
