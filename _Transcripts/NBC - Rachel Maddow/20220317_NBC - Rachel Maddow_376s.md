# Russia Covers Disastrous Ground Assault On Ukraine With Reckless Aerial Bombing
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc)
*  American and British officials are now saying that Russian forces have suffered significant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=0.0s)]
*  casualties and setback since the war began. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=4.68s)]
*  As the New York Times put it today, Pentagon officials say a 10 percent casualty rate, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=7.4s)]
*  including dead and wounded, for a single unit renders it unable to carry out combat-related [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  tasks. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=17.0s)]
*  With more than 150,000 Russian troops now involved in the war in Ukraine, Russian casualties, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=18.0s)]
*  when including the estimated 14,000 to 21,000 injured, are near that level. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=25.36s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the people bylined on that report. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=31.92s)]
*  Eric Schmidt is a senior writer covering terrorism and national security for the New York Times. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=35.0s)]
*  Eric, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=40.44s)]
*  First of all, help me understand the differing claims of the number of soldiers who have [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=42.4s)]
*  died. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=47.6s)]
*  We get claims from the Ukrainians that are higher than what this estimate that you're [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=48.6s)]
*  reporting on is. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=52.8s)]
*  How do we determine the accuracy of what the U.S. intelligence community is saying, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=54.24s)]
*  that it's somewhere around 7,000 troops in the first three weeks of fighting? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=59.2s)]
*  These are very difficult numbers to come by, Ali, and it is an imprecise science to be [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  sure. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=68.4s)]
*  You've got the Russians who are coming with very low numbers in the high hundreds figures. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=69.4s)]
*  Then you have the Ukrainians who mentioned are somewhere 13 or 14,000. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=73.28s)]
*  That's probably well inflated. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=76.88s)]
*  The Pentagon is looking at those numbers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  They look at other social media claims. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=80.72s)]
*  They're also looking at battle damage assessment. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=82.62s)]
*  That's the military term for looking at the damage done to tanks, to armored vehicles, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=85.22s)]
*  other things that troops are in. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=90.26s)]
*  And basically estimating by the number of troops they know are in these different vehicles [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=91.7s)]
*  and then extrapolating from that, that will help the estimate as well. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  But even Pentagon officials say the 7,000 figure, while conservative, is an imprecise [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=101.18s)]
*  one and they're searching for better ways to get a higher, a better handle on it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  That is the number that they're going with right now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=112.08s)]
*  And it is, as you said in your opening report, quite staggering. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  It is staggering. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=118.72s)]
*  We've also heard that between three and four generals have been killed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=119.72s)]
*  Investigation into one of them is whether or not they were using an unsecured cell phone [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=124.52s)]
*  or a radio that allowed them to be geo-targeted. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=127.36s)]
*  These kind of losses are, the one thing that U.S. intelligence, which was otherwise very [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=131.85999999999999s)]
*  accurate about before this invasion, the one thing they were off on was the speed with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=136.26s)]
*  which Russia would be able to overtake Ukraine. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=140.48s)]
*  That is, it's just unfolding unlike anything anyone expected. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=143.6s)]
*  That's right. The Russians, by all accounts, felt they could get into Kiev, the capital, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=149.24s)]
*  within one or two days, basically take over the leadership there and then probably take [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=153.4s)]
*  over most of the country in the next week or two. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=157.64s)]
*  That obviously hasn't happened for a couple of big reasons. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=159.84s)]
*  One is just the fierce resistance they met from the Ukrainians, as your report is documented [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=162.8s)]
*  right now. The other thing is they overestimated their [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=167.6s)]
*  own capabilities going into Ukraine. Serious logistics problems, shortages of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=170.36s)]
*  fuel, of food, of spare parts. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  We've heard widespread reports of conscripts, young and inexperienced troops who were not [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=177.52s)]
*  told they were going into a war zone, basically walking away from some of their vehicles and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=183.08s)]
*  some of these convoys we've heard that have been stalled going into Kiev. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=187.68s)]
*  So it's been a collection of errors on the logistical side. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=191.12s)]
*  It's also been a flawed campaign of the ground forces not really being synced up with the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=194.08s)]
*  air forces in a normal way you've had your battle. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=199.52s)]
*  And so what they've had do is resort to the tactics that your earlier report mentioned, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=203.0s)]
*  stand back and pummel these cities with artillery, long-range missiles and some aerial bombing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=207.96s)]
*  And again, to people who are not sort of trained in understanding military techniques, it's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=212.96s)]
*  hard to understand. But really this means you can't be bombing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=221.24s)]
*  or shelling a city or shelling locations where your troops are located. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=224.84s)]
*  So if the troops, the ground troops are not able to do what they're supposed to do, now [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=229.32s)]
*  what we're seeing is, as Cal was reporting, Russian troops retreating from those positions, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=232.12s)]
*  somehow sometimes leaving dead Russian soldiers behind while they call in air support, which [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=237.76s)]
*  then bombards an area. It's an inefficient way of doing things, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  to say the least. That's right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=245.48s)]
*  It's quite a brutal way of doing things. What's happening is on the outskirts of all [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=248.16s)]
*  these cities you've mentioned, the Ukrainian forces are basically fighting the much, you [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=252.2s)]
*  know, numerically superior and technologically superior Russian forces, roughly to a standstill. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=257.52s)]
*  So rather than being able to advance further and inerring most of these cities, the Russians [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  are having to stand back and use the one weapon they do have a lot of, and that is artillery [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=267.56s)]
*  and these missiles and basically weapons of terror at this point, trying, forcing the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  civilian population to flee, damaging much of the cities and basically trying to take [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=276.2s)]
*  over from there. What we haven't seen yet is urban combat. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=280.82s)]
*  The Russians trying to get inside of the streets of these cities, that's where it could [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=284.88s)]
*  get really bloody and really bad, even worse than what we've seen now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=289.8s)]
*  In the few instances where we have seen that, however, it seems initially the Ukrainians [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=295.6s)]
*  seem to have an advantage. In places like Kiev, where they have sort of retreated to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  areas that they control inside the city to draw Russians in, it seems to result in some [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=305.04s)]
*  confusion, obviously, because the Russian soldiers don't know the landscape. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=310.12s)]
*  They don't know the territory as well. So that becomes advantage Ukrainian forces. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=313.84s)]
*  Absolutely. The Ukrainians know the terrain. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  They're fighting on their home turf and they're highly motivated to defend their homeland. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  Whereas we've seen the Russian morale, whether it's the conscripted troops force all the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  way up to some of these general offices you've mentioned, it's somewhat in disarray now. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  Morale is bad. They're not really fighting for a cause they believe in. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  Whereas the Ukrainians, rallied by President Zelensky, are fighting hard, unexpectedly [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=339.04s)]
*  hard, and hanging in there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  Again, we'll see how long this can last, though, because, again, the Russian military, one [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=346.48s)]
*  of the strongest in the world, going up against Ukraine now, it's a tough fight all the way [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=350.44s)]
*  around. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb4Ca0Hibfc&t=355.08000000000004s)]
