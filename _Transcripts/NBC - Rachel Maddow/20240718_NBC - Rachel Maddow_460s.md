# Team Trump targets U.S. voting system with legal plan to subvert a 2024 election loss: NYT
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw)
*  With everything else that's been going on this week, one story that we keep talking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=0.0s)]
*  about, that we keep coming back to, is the lead story in The New York Times on Saturday [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=4.44s)]
*  night before that tragic shooting at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania that wounded the former [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=8.84s)]
*  president, was this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=14.4s)]
*  Unbowed by January 6th charges, Republicans pursue plans to contest a Trump defeat, written [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=18.32s)]
*  among other things by, among other reporters by Jim Rutenberg at The New York Times. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=24.48s)]
*  The Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in unprecedented legal [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=28.92s)]
*  campaign targeting the American voting system. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=32.72s)]
*  Their wide ranging and methodical effort is laying the groundwork to contest the next [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=35.32s)]
*  election, including by attempting to short circuit the process of ratifying the winner. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=39.84s)]
*  Again, this is not a backward looking article about what Trump and his allies did in 2020. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=46.0s)]
*  This is about what they're planning on doing this year. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=51.64s)]
*  Again, this story co-by-lined by our next guest, Jim Rutenberg, a writer at large for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  The New York Times. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Mr. Rutenberg, thanks very much for joining us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=60.64s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=62.24s)]
*  Thanks. Thanks for having me. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=63.96s)]
*  Is the sort of scheme that you outline in your article here, is it a rerun of what [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=66.0s)]
*  happened in January 2020 or is it the kind of thing, the kind of way you would rerun [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  something if you could go back and do it all better so this time it would work? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=78.28s)]
*  It's more the latter, for sure. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=82.64s)]
*  At the end of the day, what they tried to do in 2020 didn't work for their purposes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=85.16s)]
*  Right. And I just want to say a lot of legal experts believe this won't work either. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=89.84s)]
*  But what we do know is that there's a lot going on across this country to look at that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=95.44s)]
*  certification process and change it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=100.48s)]
*  And if your viewers will remember, and you did this in your lead up, that the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  certification process is exactly what was being dealt with at Capitol Hill on January [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=107.4s)]
*  6th, the pageantry of democracy, that act of certifying an election. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=113.08s)]
*  It's ministerial. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=118.2s)]
*  There are no two ways about it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=119.48s)]
*  You vote to do it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=120.88s)]
*  And there's a move afoot already in 20 different counties. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=122.16s)]
*  We've seen this where local boards are choosing or voting against certifying. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=126.44s)]
*  It's yet to lead to a big cataclysmic stopping of a certification, but it's come closer [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=131.32s)]
*  than we've ever seen. It's unprecedented. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=136.28s)]
*  Tell us about how that might work. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=138.52s)]
*  Let's say, as you outline in your piece, a county in Nevada, say, where this has [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  happened, has local Republican officials who are true believers in this cause and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  who are sort of in on this plan. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=151.16s)]
*  And they decide, regardless of what's actually happened locally in that election, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=152.76s)]
*  that they are going to refuse to certify the results in their county. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  What is the knock on effect of that that could ultimately have national consequences? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=161.36s)]
*  Well, Rachel, you're right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=167.36s)]
*  I mean, this does did happen in Washoe County, Nevada. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=168.44s)]
*  It only resolved itself a couple of days ago. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=171.12s)]
*  This time around, the results were certified. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=174.36s)]
*  A judge came and a judge was basically court papers were filed threatening legal [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=176.72s)]
*  action to force this board to certify. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=181.72s)]
*  It was plain landed safely. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  The concern is what happens when this is in the fall. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=185.44s)]
*  And we're up against deadlines or deadlines about certification. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=188.96s)]
*  It's very clearly laid out when the electoral college votes went. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=192.0s)]
*  And then we're right into January six. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=195.68s)]
*  If one of these counties chooses not to meet that deadline for certification, it's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=197.44s)]
*  very unclear in the law. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=202.0s)]
*  And as your viewers probably remember, this law was rewritten to firm things up to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=203.2s)]
*  make it harder to short circuit an election. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  But there are some loopholes, there are some new wrinkles, including some harder [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=210.0s)]
*  deadlines, and we don't know what happens if you miss those deadlines. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of fear in the advocate community that that could lead to the whole [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=215.72s)]
*  thing getting thrown to Congress. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=220.6s)]
*  But really, who knows? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  And if you mean to be clear, not to spell it out too bluntly here, but if a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=223.24s)]
*  county comes up with certification, refuses a court order or ties it up in litigation, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=227.72s)]
*  misses that deadline, then conceivably a state misses its deadline to certify its [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=232.68s)]
*  election results because they can't get certified results from every one of their [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=238.08s)]
*  counties. The way that your piece ends is with an acknowledgement from the co-chair [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=242.0s)]
*  of the Republican National Committee refusing to commit. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=247.28s)]
*  When asked whether or not the RNC, whether or not the Republican Party is going to try [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=250.96s)]
*  to block certification of the results in any states this fall, the RNC is essentially [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=257.56s)]
*  refusing to say whether they are joined in this effort, raising the prospect that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  they are. If a state doesn't have any certified election results, presumably that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=268.44s)]
*  means they don't submit an electoral slate and the Electoral College can't be [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  tallied. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=277.64s)]
*  That is true that the RNC, the chairman himself, other people there I've spoken to, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=279.0s)]
*  they're sort of at best alighting it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=285.04s)]
*  They're not coming out and saying that we do not believe this should happen. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=286.88s)]
*  And in fact, there are there are a couple of legal cases where the Republican [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=289.8s)]
*  conservative groups are challenging the whole idea of how it's supposed to work, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=293.88s)]
*  saying that board members should be able to vote their conscience and maybe vote [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=297.68s)]
*  against certification. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=301.88s)]
*  Again, the laws very clearly say you vote for certification. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=303.92s)]
*  It's a ministerial thing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=308.04s)]
*  So they're trying to redefine it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  And the RNC is not disavowing it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=310.76s)]
*  Now, look, nobody in this hall today thinks that it's going to require that it could be [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  required to do this in the fall. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=317.56s)]
*  But we all know it's going to be often a close election in this country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=319.0s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=322.48s)]
*  Jim, let me just ask you one last question. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=323.68s)]
*  Outlining this the way that you have, again, one of the things that's interesting here [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=325.76s)]
*  is that it is sort of happening in full view. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  You talk about 20 different jurisdictions, at least for low level Republican officials [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=332.28s)]
*  are already refusing certification, not not in places where there's real [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=336.28s)]
*  scandal or worrisome content of the election results, but seemingly because they're [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=342.08s)]
*  just inclined not to certify anymore. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=347.28s)]
*  If we can see this happening and you as a reporter can see this happening, the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party can see this happening, too. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=353.28s)]
*  Are you seeing any evidence of a counter effort or any sort of counteroffensive [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=356.36s)]
*  on the side of the Democrats to try to head this off? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=362.32s)]
*  Yeah, we're told there's a very strong counter effort. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=367.24s)]
*  The Democrats say again, unprecedented. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=370.0s)]
*  We hate using that word in my newspaper. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=372.24s)]
*  We only use it when it's true. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=374.32s)]
*  But the Democrats say that there's an unprecedented effort to meet this challenge, to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=375.36s)]
*  get on the ground in these states, to monitor. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=379.36s)]
*  In fact, that Washoe County Board, it's a tiny it's a commission board that a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=382.0s)]
*  Democratic group came in to support a Republican on that board who's very traditional [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=386.48s)]
*  Republican who believes in the certification process. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=390.88s)]
*  Interestingly, she ended up voting against her own certification under immense pressure, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=393.92s)]
*  but reversed her vote this week. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=399.12s)]
*  And that's how that went through. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=400.56s)]
*  But the Democrats are all over this. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=402.0s)]
*  And no matter what is going to happen with that campaign, their lawyers are engaged in [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=404.44s)]
*  dealing. And so are many civil rights lawyers whose whose goal is not as partisan. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=408.0s)]
*  It's a civil rights issue to them. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=412.92s)]
*  And they're involved as well. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, this shouldn't have to be the way that elections are fought. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=415.48s)]
*  But this is a very first, early, clear view that this is the way this one's going to be [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=418.76000000000005s)]
*  fought. It's not just about votes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=423.36s)]
*  It's about the way elections work or don't. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=425.16s)]
*  Jim Rutenberg, writer at large for The New York Times and The New York Times magazine. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-D29h5EEbw&t=427.44000000000005s)]
