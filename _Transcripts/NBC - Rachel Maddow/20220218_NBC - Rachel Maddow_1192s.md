# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 17
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew)
*  So what happens to these loans now that Trump has been deemed unreliable by his own accountants? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Suzanne Craig, one of the reporters who broke that story about Trump's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=6.32s)]
*  debts. She and her Pulitzer Prize winning reporting team have done by far the most [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=10.72s)]
*  in-depth reporting on Trump's finances since he was president. Great to see you tonight, Suzanne. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=15.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me. So you reported in 2020 that Trump had personally guaranteed $420 million [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=21.04s)]
*  in loans for his own company. Who does he owe all this money to? Well, it's a small group of lenders [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=28.24s)]
*  and it's interesting if we step back and we think about, you know, there's been a lot of talk about [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=35.6s)]
*  now that not only this has happened that his accountants have stepped back, but the chief [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=40.32s)]
*  financial officer of his company is under indictment, his company is under indictment, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  a lot going on here, you know, that the covenants could be breached. And he has, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=49.28s)]
*  just in the coming couple of years, hundreds of millions of dollars that he's going to have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=54.88s)]
*  to renegotiate. And he, you know, the accounting firm is, you know, what we heard about this week. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=58.56s)]
*  And I went back after I heard about the news and I found in a filing that was in January, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=64.88s)]
*  it kind of took on new meaning, that there is another accounting firm that's in place, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=71.92s)]
*  a firm named Whitley Penn. So that's like a first step. They're out of Texas. So he's moved to at [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  least get another firm in place, at least for some of his accounting. But what happens to all [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=82.56s)]
*  these loans? And the first one that comes up and it's coming up this year is on the Trump Tower. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=86.8s)]
*  There's a hundred million dollar loan there that he's going to have to renegotiate. If this was a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=92.0s)]
*  public company, you'd be like, wow, like it would just be so much trouble for them because I think [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=96.48s)]
*  their stock would tank. There would be so many ramifications. But in this case, I think on that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=101.92s)]
*  loan, he may be able to renegotiate it. I mean, I think it's going to probably be at a higher [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=106.88s)]
*  rate, but he knows the lender, the lender's friendly to his company, and it's on Trump [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=111.6s)]
*  Tower and occupancy rates have gone down on Trump Tower. But I still think he'll probably [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  be able to get that one maybe over the line with higher rates. But there's other loans that are [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  going to be more difficult. I think about Doral is one. Doral is, he bought it in 2012. He spent [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=128.32s)]
*  a hundred and some million dollars to buy that golf course. It's losing a huge amount of money. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=135.84s)]
*  He's pumped more than two hundred million dollars in capital into it. And Deutsche Bank is the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=140.48s)]
*  lender. Deutsche Bank has been signaling that they may not want to do new business with him. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  So I think when he comes up against that, there could be some problems there. I mean, none of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=150.0s)]
*  this is good news. And I just think when you think about how he's going to have to handle just this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=155.92s)]
*  immediate debt, there's going to be potentially higher rates. And also just in some cases, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=161.6s)]
*  I wonder who the lender is going to end up being. Well, I think we all are wondering [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=167.52s)]
*  and whether the charm of Donald Trump is going to be enough to just get away with a higher rate. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  And that's all. I mean, that's all a side note. Donald Trump turns out not a great businessman. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=175.52s)]
*  I mean, there's hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars on debt on properties that he's been [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=180.72s)]
*  pumping money into. I mean, that's the yeah. And I think, you know, you were talking about the old [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  post office earlier and I was thinking, wow, you know, there's so much going on there. First of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=190.88000000000002s)]
*  all, we don't know how much he is going to get out of that. Everybody's saying he's going to walk [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=195.28s)]
*  away with it. You know, I think I've heard 70 million, 100 million. We don't know the terms [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=199.76s)]
*  of that deal and that it is cash. He's going to have to pay back $170 million to his lender. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  And we just don't know the terms of that deal. I'm always like, well, hang on. I just I haven't [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=209.04s)]
*  seen that. And I just want to caution people about that. And then I also think about the old post [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=213.76s)]
*  office that he's selling it. He's selling that's like the last asset that he actually, you know, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=218.32s)]
*  put a lot into and he's selling it. He must need cash or he wouldn't be selling it. Like, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=224.64s)]
*  it's one of the first things that I think of when I hear that. And I think we're going to potentially [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=230.32s)]
*  see other asset sales. He has very few of his main assets, these golf courses that he has that are [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=235.04s)]
*  making money. He's got, you know, golf courses overseas. None of them are making money. I mean, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=241.76s)]
*  I've seen his tax returns. It's the exception when he has a business that is making money. In 2018, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=246.64s)]
*  the last year that I've seen his tax returns, he lost forty seven million dollars in change, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=252.88s)]
*  you know, a tax loss of that. And then he headed in from there. He went into COVID where a lot of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=260.48s)]
*  his you know, a lot of his properties were really struggling. I mean, this is not a company that's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=265.28s)]
*  doing great and having banner years. It's the opposite of that. I mean, I don't mean I'm not [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  joking here when I say it's possible that the only asset Trump may have in a few years that's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=277.28s)]
*  worth anything is a potential bid at the presidency is the is the scepter of potential power that could [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=283.11999999999995s)]
*  keep people off of his back. Is that an overstatement to say? I mean, I mean, he's got [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  Marlargo has made money in the past, but there's very few that are. But, you know, I think you don't [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  know sort of when you start, he's going to have to start selling out. I think we're seeing that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=299.52s)]
*  selling the old post office. I mean, that's a major sale for him. And it's not something I would [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=304.48s)]
*  imagine somebody who, you know, it's not probably something he wanted to get rid of. And I think [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=309.36s)]
*  that that's what you're going to see is he moves forward in order to keep these other properties [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=314.56s)]
*  going. You know, you just start looking for where you can raise cash and do that by selling assets. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=320.8s)]
*  And stakes and vodka and ties, I guess. Suzanne Craig, investigative reporter for [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  The New York Times. Thank you so much for your work and thanks for joining us. Thanks for having me. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=332.88s)]
*  Have you ever seen one of those Comedy Central roasts? They're these TV specials where a bunch [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=339.28s)]
*  of comedians get together and roast or make fun of some famous person. And that famous person has [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=344.48s)]
*  to sit there all night on stage in front of an audience and just take it. About a decade ago, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=350.32s)]
*  in 2011, they held one of these roasts of Donald Trump and the comedians that night. They were [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=356.8s)]
*  absolutely brutal. They made fun of Trump's hair, his face, his family, his sex life, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=363.12s)]
*  his allegedly racist business practices. Nothing was off limits. There is not a single joke. I can [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  even repeat here because of course this is a family show, but there was one thing that the comedians [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=376.24s)]
*  that night were told they could not joke about. One thing that was absolutely off limits. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=383.76s)]
*  Absolutely no jokes about Donald Trump not being as rich as he says he is. One of the writers for [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=390.48s)]
*  the roast said that that was the red line for Trump. Quote, any joke that suggests Trump is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=397.84s)]
*  not actually as wealthy as he claims to be. The comedian Anthony Giselnik, who roasted Trump that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=404.08s)]
*  night said quote, Trump's one rule was don't say I have less money than I say I do. His kids were [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=410.8s)]
*  fair game. His wife was fair game. This money net worth. This is Trump's kryptonite. He once sued [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=417.6s)]
*  a reporter for daring to write that Trump was not in fact a billionaire. He pursued the case for years, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=426.16s)]
*  but when Trump sat down for a deposition in that suit and the reporters' lawyers tried to pin him [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=432.8s)]
*  down on how much he was actually worth, Trump testified under oath quote, my net worth fluctuates [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=437.36s)]
*  and it goes up and down with the markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=445.12s)]
*  Feelings. Donald Trump lost that suit. Hard to believe. I know. But sometimes Donald Trump needs [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=452.32s)]
*  something to back up whatever his feelings are about his net worth. He needs a piece of paper [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=459.76s)]
*  to show a seller so he can buy some real estate or to a lender to get a loan or, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=464.96s)]
*  you know, to the American people so he can get elected president. That's when he turns to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=469.84s)]
*  something called a statement of financial condition prepared by his longtime accounting firm, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=474.23999999999995s)]
*  Mazar's. This he could hand to a potential lender or seller and say, see, here it is in black and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=479.44s)]
*  white prepared by my accountants. I, Donald Trump, am rich. So you can imagine just how [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump felt this week when his longtime accounting firm, Mazar's, announced they were [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=492.56s)]
*  quitting and that they were renouncing a decade's worth of statements of financial condition that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=496.88s)]
*  they had prepared for Trump. Those statements, quote, according to Mazar's, should no longer [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=503.52s)]
*  be relied upon. We have come to this conclusion based in part upon the filings made by the New [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=508.8s)]
*  York attorney general. New York attorney general, Letitia James, has been investigating Trump's [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=514.48s)]
*  business practices, in particular whether he may have fraudulently misrepresented his assets to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=520.08s)]
*  obtain loans and tax benefits. Trump's accounting firm looked at the evidence she has accumulated [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  thus far and was like, oh, we are out of here. And Donald Trump's reaction to his accounting firm [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=531.84s)]
*  basically saying we can no longer vouch for Trump being as rich as he says he is. Well, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  it was about what you'd expect. Trump put out what may be the longest, most ranty statement he has [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=545.04s)]
*  ever released since leaving office. And the statement said, I'm paraphrasing here, I swear [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=551.68s)]
*  I'm really rich, even richer than you think. Far from inflating his net worth, Trump claimed that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=557.04s)]
*  the Mazar's statements actually undercounted how rich he is. Ultimately, of course, his statements [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=564.64s)]
*  ends up at Hillary Clinton and why she should probably be put to death. But remember the main [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=570.88s)]
*  thing here, don't listen to anyone who says Donald Trump is not as rich as he says he is. That is the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=577.68s)]
*  one thing prohibited, not allowed. And that was just the start of Donald Trump's week, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=583.92s)]
*  which has really gone from bad to worse. Today, lawyers for Trump and two of his adult children, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=591.2s)]
*  Don Jr. And Ivanka appeared in court to argue to a judge why the Trumps should not have to comply [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=597.12s)]
*  with subpoenas from New York Attorney General Letitia James. It did not go well for them. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=602.64s)]
*  For starters, the judge's clerk had to keep reprimanding Trump's lawyer for interrupting [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=609.68s)]
*  the judge, telling her, quote, counselor, when the judge speaks, you need to stop talking. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=614.4s)]
*  The judge appeared unimpressed by Trump's lawyers repeatedly bringing up who else, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=621.04s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, and asking why Letitia James isn't investigating her. After that performance, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=626.4799999999999s)]
*  it took the judge only a few hours to rule that, yes, Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=633.36s)]
*  Trump must comply with the subpoenas, which means that all three of them must sit for depositions [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=638.88s)]
*  with the New York Attorney General about the Trump organization's business practices. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=645.5999999999999s)]
*  And their testimony could potentially be shared with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=650.8s)]
*  which is conducting a parallel criminal probe. Or they could all just plead the fifth, as Trump's [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=655.28s)]
*  other son, Eric, already did over 500 times when he testified to Letitia James's office. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=662.56s)]
*  But one thing that is important to understand here is the snowballing nature of Trump's legal [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=671.28s)]
*  and financial predicament. Today's ruling, compelling Trump and his children to testify, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  is in part a result of Mazar's, Trump's accounting firm, it's of Mazar's abandoning him earlier this [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=682.0s)]
*  week. In his ruling today, the judge specifically quotes the Mazar's letter renouncing all those [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=689.2s)]
*  Trump financial statements. The implication seems to be, yeah, this kind of sketchy thing is exactly [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=694.96s)]
*  why you need to go testify about your business practices. But you know what? Being compelled to [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=700.24s)]
*  testify to the New York Attorney General may not even be the worst thing that has happened to Donald [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=707.68s)]
*  Trump as a result of those dodgy financial statements. As you know, Donald Trump runs a hotel [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=713.12s)]
*  just down the street from the White House. He doesn't own the building itself, though. He leases [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=719.5999999999999s)]
*  the building from the federal government under a deal struck back in 2013 before he was president. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=724.64s)]
*  Like many of his properties recently, the Trump Hotel in D.C. has been losing money. But unlike [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=730.64s)]
*  his other properties, Trump has actually found a lucrative way to get out of that D.C. hotel. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=736.8s)]
*  He's reportedly found a buyer willing to buy the lease from him for a cool $375 million, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=742.56s)]
*  which is well over the market rate. And Trump appears to really need that money. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=748.88s)]
*  Like I said, his properties are losing money. He has hundreds of millions of dollars in debt coming [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=754.88s)]
*  due in the next few years. His primary bank, Deutsche Bank, has said they won't do any more [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=759.68s)]
*  business with him in the future. Oh, and did I mention his accountants just quit? But at least, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=764.8s)]
*  at least he's got that $375 million deal to sell that D.C. hotel, right? Right? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=771.12s)]
*  Today, the House Oversight Committee wrote to the federal agency that manages Trump's lease on his [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=781.68s)]
*  hotel and said they should consider canceling the lease. Why? Because his accountants just announced [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=786.0s)]
*  that no one should rely on the financial statements they prepared for Trump. And their [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=793.12s)]
*  financial statements were what Trump submitted to the federal government to get the lease for his [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=797.68s)]
*  hotel. And submitting false financial statements to get the lease would breach the terms of the deal, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=802.24s)]
*  meaning the government could terminate the lease. And if there's no lease, then Trump can't sell [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=807.76s)]
*  the lease, which means no $375 million. And as if that weren't bad enough news for Trump, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=814.4s)]
*  the Oversight Committee says it has also obtained parts of Trump's agreement with Deutsche Bank [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=822.56s)]
*  for a $170 million loan to finance the construction of that D.C. hotel. And that, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=827.52s)]
*  that loan agreement also relied on, take a guess, at least one of those financial statements from [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=834.56s)]
*  Mazar's. And if Trump provided false financial information to Deutsche Bank in order to get [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=841.8399999999999s)]
*  that loan, well, in theory, Deutsche Bank could decide the deal is broken and call in repayment [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=846.96s)]
*  of that $170 million loan right now. That's how any normal loan would work anyway. In other words, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=852.96s)]
*  thanks to this report from the House Oversight Committee today, not only could Donald Trump [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=862.1600000000001s)]
*  potentially lose his ability to sell his D.C. hotel for a handsome profit, he may be on the [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=866.24s)]
*  hook for a giant loan on that very same hotel much sooner than he planned. Joining us now is [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=872.24s)]
*  Virginia Democratic Congressman Jerry Connolly, senior member of the House Committee and one of [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  the authors of that letter that was sent to the General Services Administration today regarding [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=884.88s)]
*  Trump's D.C. hotel. Congressman Connolly is also the chairman of the Subcommittee on Government [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=889.6800000000001s)]
*  Operations. Sir, thank you for being here. I know you are very busy with important things. We very [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=894.48s)]
*  much appreciate your time. My pleasure, Alex. What's the timeline here? I mean, when do you [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=899.76s)]
*  expect the GSA to respond to your concerns that Trump has likely violated his contract with the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=906.56s)]
*  government? Obviously, I would hope that they would expedite their review and would come to the same [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=912.08s)]
*  conclusion many of us have already, which is that on its face, the action by Missouri this week [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=918.4s)]
*  negates the validity of any financial information or disclosure Trump has provided to GSA [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=925.76s)]
*  in justification for the lease he was granted six years ago. That ought to happen right away. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=933.2s)]
*  This could be fraught, and GSA should have nothing to do with it and ought to do the right thing and [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=939.92s)]
*  pull the plug expeditiously. I guess I wonder, I mean, this hotel project has been fraught from [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=945.68s)]
*  the beginning, right? It's always been the locus of a lot of lawsuits and consternation. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=951.84s)]
*  What do you make of the Deutsche Bank loan? Deutsche Bank agreed to loan Trump $170 million [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=958.96s)]
*  for this hotel property, but it turns out they were only given access to two pages of his tax [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=966.0s)]
*  returns, and they weren't allowed to keep any copies of financial statements. Do you have a [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=972.1600000000001s)]
*  theory about why Deutsche Bank would agree to lend him so much money under those conditions, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=976.8s)]
*  which seem extraordinary given the lack of information? Deutsche Bank is a very prominent [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=982.0799999999999s)]
*  international financial institution, and yet it's always had a strange bromance with Donald Trump. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=991.52s)]
*  It's cut corners, it's loaned when no one else would, it's taken very risky moves to finance [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=999.6800000000001s)]
*  investments that nobody else would touch. It has given him favorable treatment, as it did in this [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1007.0400000000001s)]
*  circumstance. What bank in its right mind would loan anybody $170 million based on two pages of very [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1015.0400000000001s)]
*  thin gruel by way of financial disclosure? That's just reckless behavior by a financial institution. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1023.36s)]
*  The nature of the relationship between the Trump Organization, Donald Trump personally, and Deutsche [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1030.4s)]
*  Bank is something that I think is highly questionable and worthy of examination by [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1036.0s)]
*  the DA, by the US Attorney, and by, frankly, the Department of Justice. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1044.72s)]
*  Well, speaking of strange bromances, there's also the group, the hotel group, Miami-based [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1050.24s)]
*  CGI merchant group that's trying to buy this lease off of Trump for well over market value, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1056.8799999999999s)]
*  somewhere to the tune of $75 million or $100 million over the market value of the Trump hotel [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1062.8799999999999s)]
*  in DC. Do you know anything about this group, and what kind of concerns do you have about GSA approving [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1068.7199999999998s)]
*  a sale of this property to an unknown investor that's willing to pay an inflated price? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1075.2s)]
*  I don't have any particulars on this group, CGI management, but again, it just smells. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1081.2s)]
*  Why would anyone pay a premium above any kind of reasonable market value for a lease [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1091.52s)]
*  on a hotel that's been losing money and Trump has been lying about it? That's before the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1099.1200000000001s)]
*  Mazar decision to essentially renounce 10 years of financial disclosures. So what is going on here? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1103.68s)]
*  Why do you want to enrich Donald Trump at such a premium? And that goes back to your other question [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  about GSA and how quickly they ought to act. No one's above the law. GSA should not be an enabler [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1118.48s)]
*  to enrich Donald Trump in clearly falsification of documents by way of financial information [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1126.56s)]
*  and falsification of valuation and falsification of income. And he's engaged in all three, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1134.3999999999999s)]
*  and that should not be rewarded by this potential investor in the lease and certainly not by GSA. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1140.8799999999999s)]
*  GSA can bring it all to a screaming halt and not see Trump rewarded for bad behavior [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1149.36s)]
*  by pulling the lease and pulling it now. Well, I think it's an understatement to say the [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1157.2s)]
*  federal government should not be involved in a financial bromance with a former president. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1161.84s)]
*  Virginia Democratic Congressman Jerry Connolly, thank you very much for joining us. Thank you, Alex. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1166.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U8xA7tS9Ew&t=1179.28s)]
