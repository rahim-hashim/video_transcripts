# 'Tech genius' image wears thin after series of errors calls DOGE competence into question
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k)
*  You might have seen Elon Musk making a speech at a big international conference this week [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=0.0s)]
*  in which he wore a T-shirt that said, tech support. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=4.16s)]
*  It's not a flattering look, but he thought it was hilarious. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=7.12s)]
*  He tried to say this T-shirt was a very funny joke, that he's White House tech support. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=10.28s)]
*  You know, for our generation of Howard Phillipses, our generation of the let's kill the U.S. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=18.52s)]
*  government and we don't care if it's legal or not, our guys have claimed the right to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  do what they're doing, not just because of their wild-eyed zeal against the U.S. government [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=29.88s)]
*  and the U.S. system of governing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=35.44s)]
*  They have claimed the right to do this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=37.78s)]
*  They've sort of claimed that their legitimacy comes from their tech savvy, because they're [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=39.12s)]
*  so good with computers. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  So we're all supposed to get out of their way or we're supposed to be intimidated or [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=44.54s)]
*  at least confused by what exactly they're doing, because wow, it's such a high level, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  right? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=54.8s)]
*  It's so high tech. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=55.8s)]
*  They're so tech savvy, so competent, so good at what they're doing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=57.76s)]
*  How could we mere mortals possibly understand? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=61.4s)]
*  404 Media Today reported that on the website for Doge, I don't know, Doggie, Dodgy, Doge, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=65.08s)]
*  I don't know, whatever we're supposed to call it, on their own website that Elon Musk's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=74.64s)]
*  agency destroying group has set up for themselves, it appears that random members of the public [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  have been able to upload joke categories and database entries onto that website that show [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=87.48s)]
*  up as if they are official Doge.gov data. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=94.16s)]
*  And people can add random stuff to this website, not because there's like a post your public [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=98.64s)]
*  comment here section, but because apparently when Doge designed this website for itself, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=103.5s)]
*  they didn't know how or they forgot to make the website secure so other people couldn't [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=109.06s)]
*  post random stuff on it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=114.64s)]
*  404 Media reporting today that people are posting things like, quote, these experts [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=117.0s)]
*  left their database open, and quote, this is a joke of a .gov site. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=120.8s)]
*  Remember, these are our high tech overlords. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=127.44s)]
*  At the Huffington Post today, they've got comment from an unnamed employee of the Defense [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=137.04s)]
*  Intelligence Agency pointing out that among the data that Elon Musk's little group has [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=141.0s)]
*  posted online on their apparently totally insecure half-baked website is classified [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=146.8s)]
*  information about the National Reconnaissance Office, which is the federal agency that designs, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=154.52s)]
*  builds, and maintains US intelligence satellites. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=160.28s)]
*  Quote, Doge just posted secret no foreign, meaning no, nobody who's not a US national [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=162.84s)]
*  is supposed to see it, no foreign info on their website. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=169.72s)]
*  Currently, people are scrambling to check if their info has been accessed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=173.08s)]
*  This comes on the heels of Elon Musk telling reporters in the Oval Office that we should [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=180.68s)]
*  all be shocked, shocked, the American people should be shocked by the scandalous discovery [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=185.24s)]
*  he and his high tech team made while apparently pawing through social security records and [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=189.4s)]
*  data and that part of the government's guts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=194.68s)]
*  Is he's allowed to do that? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=198.08s)]
*  I guess. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=199.2s)]
*  He said the scandal that he and his team had uncovered uncovered in social security data [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=200.2s)]
*  is that there are people in the social security database who are listed as being 150 years [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=205.2s)]
*  old. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=211.12s)]
*  And we don't know exactly what Mr. Musk was talking about because he's seeing stuff that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=212.12s)]
*  I think he's not allowed to see and neither are we. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=218.72s)]
*  But today, people started gingerly asking if perhaps Mr. Musk just didn't know that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=221.72s)]
*  in an older version of the programming language that is used by the Social Security Administration, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=227.2s)]
*  when you didn't have a date to enter in a particular field, it would code it as 150 [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=233.48s)]
*  years ago. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=239.64s)]
*  It would code it as 1875. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=240.64s)]
*  The year 1875 is essentially an error message to let you know that there isn't a real date [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  in that record and so you should treat that as an error and find out what went wrong. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=249.98s)]
*  Does he know that or does he really think those are records for 150 year old people? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=256.44s)]
*  Does he know what he's looking at when he's pawing through your social security records? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=262.92s)]
*  Remember, it's their technical prowess and know-how that's supposed to impress us and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=267.16s)]
*  make us think this is somehow different than when a far right, power mad, doomed president [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=272.4s)]
*  tried to do this exact same thing in 1973. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=276.86s)]
*  We're supposed to be intimidated here. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=281.56s)]
*  That measles outbreak we told you about last night in West Texas, it has now doubled in [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=284.56s)]
*  size as of today. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=292.36s)]
*  The CDC also has fired as many as 1300 people today. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=294.32s)]
*  The intelligence staff at the Department of Energy sent its staff an urgent warning about [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=299.72s)]
*  how to respond to Elon Musk's team seeking access to sensitive classified materials about [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=303.48s)]
*  nuclear weapons and at the National Nuclear Security Administration today, which is responsible [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=309.02s)]
*  for keeping our nuclear, our nukes safe, they fired a significant portion of their staff [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  today, hundreds of staff members. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=321.97999999999996s)]
*  Yesterday we got word that Trump and Musk's little squad of genius web developers and software [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=326.18s)]
*  engineers, the folks who may have accidentally posted the classified information on their website [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=334.9s)]
*  and left open some sort of back door so that random members of the public can post stuff on it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  That genius squad has now reportedly been sent into the IRS. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  So now that group is in there with your tax information. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=355.38s)]
*  While tonight we get word that at the IRS, just ahead of tax filing season, they are about [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=360.09999999999997s)]
*  to fire thousands, maybe 9,000 people who actually work there to handle your taxes. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=364.82s)]
*  The combination of the smash and grab by the supposedly high tech team and the mass firing [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=373.38s)]
*  of people who actually do know what they're doing means real material harm is being done [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=380.26s)]
*  to our country. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=386.9s)]
*  And it will take a long time to repair it when we finally get to start. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtApqMR3o8k&t=389.82s)]
