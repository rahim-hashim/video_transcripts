# Former Chief Of Staff Levels Another Abuse Of Power Accusation At Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw)
*  This did look like trouble at the time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=0.0s)]
*  This was the headline. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=2.24s)]
*  Comey and McCabe, who infuriated Trump, both faced intensive IRS audits. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=4.04s)]
*  Michael Schmidt at the New York Times reporting in July that of all the tens of millions of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=11.32s)]
*  taxpayers in this country, somehow two of the people Donald Trump hated most got picked, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=15.48s)]
*  supposedly at random, for an audit so invasive that tax lawyers joke about it as an autopsy [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=20.32s)]
*  without the benefit of death. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=26.9s)]
*  That was the Times reporting back in July. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  Now that already troubling story has gotten significantly worse. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=32.82s)]
*  Trump's longest serving chief of staff, John Kelly, the one you see holding the door for [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=37.78s)]
*  his boss here, John Kelly now tells the New York Times that yes, those audits were instigated [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  because Trump asked for them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=50.22s)]
*  Quote, yes, Trump wanted IRS investigations of his foes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=51.58s)]
*  John Kelly telling reporter Michael Schmidt, quote, I would say it's inappropriate. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=55.98s)]
*  It's illegal. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=59.66s)]
*  It's against their integrity. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=60.66s)]
*  And the IRS knows what it's doing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=61.66s)]
*  It's not a good idea. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=62.66s)]
*  Kelly says Trump responded, quote, yeah, but they're writing bad things about me. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=63.66s)]
*  For the record, the former president is denying these allegations from John Kelly, a spokesperson [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=68.74s)]
*  for the former president called John Kelly today a psycho. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=74.3s)]
*  That was what the spokesperson said. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=77.9s)]
*  He's a psycho. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=80.82s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=81.82s)]
*  Why'd you pick a psycho to be your longest serving chief of staff? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=82.82s)]
*  But this is a big deal and a potentially criminally big deal for anybody at the IRS who might [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=87.82s)]
*  have gone along with this kind of improper pressure and also for Donald Trump if he in [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=93.28s)]
*  fact asked for this sort of thing to be done. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=97.66s)]
*  It is a federal crime for anyone, including the president, to request even indirectly [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  an audit of anyone. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=105.78s)]
*  It's against the law to abuse the power of the IRS in that way. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=107.22s)]
*  If Trump asked for it, it's illegal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=111.22s)]
*  If Trump asked for it and the IRS then did it, it's illegal on a couple of different [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=113.26s)]
*  levels. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  When this story first emerged this summer, it appeared likely that the Treasury Department [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=120.1s)]
*  would investigate the issue. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  We're told tonight that a report from that inspector general investigation is actually [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=125.3s)]
*  expected quite soon. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  If we get anything definite, we will let you know. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  But for now, you can add this new reporting on the potential criminal actions of abusing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=134.62s)]
*  the power of the IRS. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=139.54s)]
*  You can add that to the pile of legal worries that the former president has arrayed against [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=140.62s)]
*  him right now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=145.42000000000002s)]
*  Just today, he defied a lawful subpoena to testify to the January 6th investigation in [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=146.62s)]
*  Congress. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=152.38s)]
*  He today remains in legal jeopardy in the state of Georgia, where a grand jury continues [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=154.18s)]
*  to investigate the effort to overturn the 2020 election results in that state. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is reportedly testifying in that federal grand jury, excuse [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=162.78s)]
*  me, in that state grand jury criminal investigation tomorrow morning. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  Trump also remains in legal jeopardy over the classified documents he's alleged to have [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=171.5s)]
*  taken when he left the White House. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=175.33999999999997s)]
*  Plus his company is actively on trial right now in New York on criminal charges of fraud. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=177.89999999999998s)]
*  Plus the New York attorney general is continuing a civil suit against that company for alleged [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  fraud. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=188.33999999999997s)]
*  And so of course, in that propitious environment, Donald J. Trump has decided that tomorrow [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=191.33999999999997s)]
*  is the perfect day for him to announce that he's running again for president. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=195.62s)]
*  All right, since everything else is going his way anyway, and people are just clamoring [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  for his return, nobody has ever declared a run for president, not just under a cloud, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=203.54000000000002s)]
*  but enveloped in a suffocating fog of scandal with legal jeopardy still unfolding across [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=210.46s)]
*  multiple states and jurisdictions. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=217.02s)]
*  Nobody has ever announced a run for the presidency under those circumstances. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=219.22000000000003s)]
*  But for whatever reason, that is apparently going to change tomorrow. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=224.38s)]
*  Congratulations to us. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=228.94s)]
*  Presidential history about to be made on our watch in the worst possible way. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egar7DAJclw&t=230.74s)]
