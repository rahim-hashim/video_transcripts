# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 11
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc)
*  What we're looking at is it's printed material. We're talking about what was flushed down [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=0.0s)]
*  a toilet. We were very diligent in making sure we preserve those documents. And ultimately, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=4.58s)]
*  I think the record will show that that was former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=10.32s)]
*  an interview with the pro Trump TV station Newsmax, making an eyebrow raising defense [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=14.72s)]
*  of the Trump administration's record keeping habits. Just one day after we learned that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=19.18s)]
*  Donald Trump periodically tried to flush printed paper down the toilet while in office. But [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=23.72s)]
*  what's even more eyebrow raising is the fact that Mark Meadows is there on live television [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=29.4s)]
*  talking about presidential records and the January 6th investigation at the same time [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=33.76s)]
*  that he's actually violating a subpoena from those very same investigators. It's been almost [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=38.16s)]
*  two months since the House of Representatives officially voted to recommend contempt charges [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=43.64s)]
*  for Mark Meadows because of his refusal to cooperate with that investigation. The Justice [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=47.66s)]
*  Department still hasn't said whether it's not going to charge or whether or not it's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=52.739999999999995s)]
*  going to charge Meadows with contempt of Congress for his refusal to cooperate with [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=56.52s)]
*  the investigation. The committee is still waiting on Attorney General Merrick Garland [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=60.92s)]
*  to make that determination. And it would be one thing if that was the only outstanding [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=64.64s)]
*  question that the January 6th investigators had to deal with right now. But there are [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=69.04s)]
*  a lot of balls still in the air right now for those investigators. There's the question [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=73.4s)]
*  of the missing call records in the documents turned over to investigators first reported [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=77.72s)]
*  yesterday. And the questions about whether Trump is still keeping classified material [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=83.4s)]
*  belonging to the federal government and is home in Mar-a-Lago or somewhere else. Today, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=87.92s)]
*  CNN reports that the National Archives only received the documents from Mar-a-Lago after [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=93.2s)]
*  threatening to alert Congress and the Justice Department if the records were not turned [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  over. That same CNN reporting also cites a source which says the document turnover has [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=102.56s)]
*  quote not been fully resolved and that Trump remains in possession of some documents that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=107.82s)]
*  the archives wants. Today, members of the January 6th investigation met to discuss [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=113.22s)]
*  the issue of whether or not to hold this guy, Trump's TV lawyer Rudy Giuliani, in contempt [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  for his refusal to cooperate with the investigation. This comes after a report this week that Giuliani [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=124.38s)]
*  had asked a local prosecutor in Michigan to turn over voting machines to the Trump team [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=130.06s)]
*  in the aftermath of the election. We're all still waiting to learn whether or not investigators [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=135.66s)]
*  will be able to secure an interview with Trump's daughter, White House advisor Ivanka Trump, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=140.02s)]
*  to discuss what she saw in the White House on January the 6th. All of that is still in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=144.78s)]
*  front of the investigators as they're reportedly about to enter a new public phase of their [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=151.46s)]
*  investigation with open televised hearings. A phase that investigator Liz Cheney says [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=156.14s)]
*  once and for all that Trump's lies provoked the violence on January 6th. So what can we [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=162.3s)]
*  expect in the coming days? Joining us now is Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin. He's [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=168.54000000000002s)]
*  a member of the January 6th investigation. He's the former lead impeachment manager for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=173.02s)]
*  Donald Trump's second impeachment. Congressman, thank you for being with us tonight. We appreciate [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=177.02s)]
*  your time. Liz Cheney, your Republican colleague who is on the committee, one of only two Republicans [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=181.10000000000002s)]
*  on the committee, censured by the Republican National Committee, has said that they will [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=189.22s)]
*  you, your investigation, will prove that Donald Trump's lies motivated the violence on January [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=192.82s)]
*  6th. What does that do? What happens if she's right and you're right and you have the proof? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=199.86s)]
*  Does it change anyone's mind about anything? Well, our mandate, of course, is to get to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=206.22s)]
*  the bottom of the events and to tell America the truth so people can see a clear chronology [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=213.9s)]
*  of events and the causation of different things. Now, of course, the House already impeached [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=219.46s)]
*  Donald Trump for inciting the violent insurrection against the union. And there was a 57 to 43 [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=225.02s)]
*  vote in the Senate also agreeing to that factual causation. But what we're doing here is we're [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  filling in with very empirically rooted, fine grained detail exactly what took place, who [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=238.9s)]
*  spoke to who. We're trying to fill in the operational hierarchy of who gave orders to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=248.46s)]
*  who. And so we're trying to put together the activities of that most obstructionist and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=256.14s)]
*  defiant coterie of advisors around Trump, the Steve Bannons and the Rudy Giuliani's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=262.26s)]
*  and the Roger Stones, all of their actions with the people who are far more forthcoming [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=268.34s)]
*  from the oath keepers and the three percenters and the proud boys with people from the mob, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  with people in the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=280.29999999999995s)]
*  throughout the government. So the vast majority of the people involved have told us the truth, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=285.02s)]
*  want to tell us the truth, are cooperating. And it's really that tight little entourage [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=290.05999999999995s)]
*  surrounding Donald Trump that are trying to hold out. That's what's slowing us down a little [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=296.82s)]
*  bit. But I think that although time is on their side, all of the momentum is on our side. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=302.02s)]
*  So this is interesting, the language you use, empirically rooted, fine grained detail. I remember [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  when I watched the impeachment proceedings, I actually thought you had a lot of empirically [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=312.82s)]
*  rooted, fine grained detail there and knew a lot about what happened. What to you is new? What are [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=316.86s)]
*  the things that you've learned? A lot of it's new to me. But what's new to you that changes how you [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=323.22s)]
*  see January 6 and Donald Trump's culpability in that event? Well, what was so manifest at the trial [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=329.26000000000005s)]
*  were all of Donald Trump's statements inciting the mob. You've got to go and fight and fight like hell [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=337.94000000000005s)]
*  or you're not going to have a country anymore. And when there's fraud involved, there's a completely [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=344.86s)]
*  different set of rules. And we followed that all the way back to the storming of the Michigan State [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=349.02s)]
*  Capitol where he was inciting those people. And so we were able to follow that all the way up to the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=355.62s)]
*  point of violence. And at that point, the video took over and the testimony of people who saw what [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=362.94s)]
*  happened. But what we didn't know were the operational hierarchies behind the scene. Who was [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=368.78s)]
*  giving the orders? Who's interfacing between Trump's political entourage and neo-Nazi stormtrooper [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=376.22s)]
*  groups, white nationalist groups? How was this mob activated? And how were the decisions to commit [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=384.3s)]
*  violence made? You know, look, Donald Trump is right now out there defending his decision to try [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=392.02000000000004s)]
*  to overthrow Biden's majority in the Electoral College, saying Mike Pence had the authority to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=400.18s)]
*  overturn the election. That was his entire political purpose there. But he was willing to surround [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=406.46s)]
*  that coup with a violent insurrection. And he was willing to surround that violent insurrection with [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=412.62s)]
*  mob violence against our police officers, 150 of whom ended up wounded and injured after being hit [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=417.98s)]
*  over the head and smashed in the guts and having their ribs broken and so on. So we're going to tell [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  that story. There were actual human beings responsible for this. It wasn't Donald Trump [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=429.74s)]
*  alone. There were a lot of other enablers and handlers who made it all possible. Congressman, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=434.62s)]
*  we appreciate your time as always. Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin is a member of the January [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=440.14s)]
*  6th investigation. Joining us now is Michael McFaul. He served as the United States Ambassador to Russia [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=444.46000000000004s)]
*  under President Obama. His new piece today in Foreign Affairs is titled, How to Make a Deal with [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=450.86s)]
*  Putin. Only a Comprehensive Pact Can Avoid War. Mr. Ambassador, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=455.34s)]
*  It is an important and crucial time. You have a suggestion on the table. Your article actually [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=461.34s)]
*  suggests that there's a way out of this. What does it look like? Well, Ollie, first I want to say I'm [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=466.21999999999997s)]
*  not optimistic that my proposal would be accepted by Vladimir Putin. I want to be clear about that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=471.97999999999996s)]
*  But I think if Putin wants to negotiate about European security and not just about small things [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=478.29999999999995s)]
*  and not about things that we cannot do, like closing the door to NATO forever, that will never [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=484.94s)]
*  happen. There's a lot of concrete things that American, Russian, Canadian, European negotiators [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=490.22s)]
*  could do. I call it Helsinki 2.0 because Helsinki was signed in 1975. By the way, when we were in a [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=497.02000000000004s)]
*  very confrontational relationship with the communist Soviet Union, we had many disagreements [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=503.82s)]
*  around the world. Remember, communists had just taken over in Southeast Asia and Southern Africa, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=509.1s)]
*  and yet in that context, we managed to negotiate. It took several years, a treaty that made European, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=514.46s)]
*  all of Europe safer. And that's basically what I wrote about, and I think that's on offer, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=521.34s)]
*  if Putin decides he wants to negotiate. Let me read a little bit from that suggestion about what [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=527.02s)]
*  you were just talking about at Helsinki. You said, to launch these ambitious negotiations, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=531.26s)]
*  all OSCE leaders, Biden and Putin included, could meet in Helsinki this year. The countries would [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=536.38s)]
*  then station special envoys there dedicated to hashing out a new agreement. Their work would be [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=541.82s)]
*  complemented by negotiations at the OSCE headquarters in Vienna, the NATO-Russian Council in Brussels, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=547.34s)]
*  and in bilateral US-Russian channels. Diplomats could aim to complete their final product by 2025, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=553.1800000000001s)]
*  the 50th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act. This seems like a really reasonable approach to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=559.74s)]
*  people who have been long-time combatants looking for a solution. Maybe something like that could [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=564.7800000000001s)]
*  work with Israel and the Palestinians. Does this meet the goals that Putin has right now? Is he [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=568.7s)]
*  not enjoying the fact that we are all talking about this and not sure about what he's going to do? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=574.46s)]
*  Yes and no. So yes, he's enjoying all the attention, right? He's enjoying all these phone [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=581.6600000000001s)]
*  calls, all the visitors, and he's really enjoying the fact that this frame that he put on this crisis [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=586.86s)]
*  about NATO expansion is what a lot of us are spending a time arguing about. We're not arguing [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=592.5400000000001s)]
*  about annexation of Crimea, right? We're not arguing about the recognition of South Ossetia [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=597.58s)]
*  and Abkhazia in Georgia from 2008. He loves that. But I actually do think if he wants to negotiate, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=606.94s)]
*  there are real things we can do in terms of transparency, pulling our soldiers back, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=614.3000000000001s)]
*  maybe limiting some weapons, but we can't meet his maximalist demands, right? We can't entertain [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=619.58s)]
*  the idea of closing NATO's door. And by the way, he probably won't meet our maximalist demands of [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=625.5s)]
*  leaving Crimea anytime soon. So sometimes in negotiations, you have to agree to disagree [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=631.98s)]
*  about maximalist positions. That's what we did during the START negotiations with the Russians [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=637.34s)]
*  when I was in the government. You agree to disagree, you write them down in side letters, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=642.22s)]
*  and then you try to find some agreement about the limited things that you can agree on based on [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=647.58s)]
*  reciprocity and mutual interest. And I think on European security, there are some issues where [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=652.38s)]
*  we could agree with the Russians if Vladimir Putin wants to negotiate. And I want to emphasize, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=658.22s)]
*  I don't think he does, but if he does, I think there's a way forward. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=664.3s)]
*  And that is the great unknown, but it is the unknown in which people like you throw yourselves [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=668.06s)]
*  into because diplomacy is always better than the alternative. Michael McQuall, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=673.1s)]
*  thank you for being with us. Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia under President Obama. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=676.94s)]
*  President Biden is spending the weekend at Camp David where he will not only have a phone call [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=682.38s)]
*  with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow, he'll also spend the weekend reviewing materials [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=686.3s)]
*  about his short list of Supreme Court contenders to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=690.78s)]
*  Things seem to be moving fast on that front. Last night, President Biden told NBC's Lester [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=696.14s)]
*  Holt in an interview that he's taken a deep dive on about four people. Today, several sources are [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=701.26s)]
*  telling NBC News the list is down to three women, Judges Katanji Brown Jackson, Michelle [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=706.62s)]
*  Childs, and Leandra Kruger. As you know, the president promised to name a black woman to the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=712.22s)]
*  job. The White House also weighed in about a dispute about one of those candidates today, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=717.34s)]
*  Judge Katanji Brown Jackson, thereby officially confirming that she's on the short list. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=721.66s)]
*  The clock is ticking. Democrats want the interview process to begin as early as next week [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=726.62s)]
*  and the name of the final contender by the end of the month. We shall see, as Rachel says, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=730.86s)]
*  watch this space. Oklahoma's legislative session started back up this week. The lawmakers are [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=735.98s)]
*  considering a slate of anti-abortion measures, including one bill that would create a database [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=742.0600000000001s)]
*  of pregnant people in the state seeking an abortion and another measure that would ban [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=746.86s)]
*  abortion after 30 days since a missed period. 30 days, that's sooner than many women know that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=751.9s)]
*  they are pregnant and it's definitely sooner than many people decide if they want to seek abortion [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=757.26s)]
*  Over in New Hampshire, the state house debated a bill that would allow any man who claims to be the [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=762.62s)]
*  father to sue a woman seeking an abortion and ultimately force her to keep the pregnancy [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=768.54s)]
*  even against her will. One state house Republican explained, quote, it's actually about recognizing [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=773.66s)]
*  that men have the rights, fathers have some rights, but how do we go about making sure those rights [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=778.54s)]
*  are recognized? End quote. Well, this bill suggests lawmakers want to do that by usurping [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=783.9s)]
*  a woman's control over her own body. It's nothing short of alarming that any of these bills aren't [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=789.5s)]
*  being considered anywhere in the democratic United States in which a constitution is guaranteed, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=794.7s)]
*  that an abortion is guaranteed by the constitution. But if you want a better sense [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=800.54s)]
*  of the trend lines in this country, when it comes to the reproductive rights, take a look at Florida. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=804.06s)]
*  Just a few months ago, Florida lawmakers were cooking up a bill that would imitate the Texas [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=810.14s)]
*  Vigilante law that effectively bans all abortion after six weeks. But since the Texas law has been [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=814.3s)]
*  kicked around from court to court, Florida dropped that model in favor of a different kind of anti- [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=821.02s)]
*  abortion bill, one that's more like Mississippi's law that bans abortion after 15 weeks and is [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=825.9799999999999s)]
*  currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. Florida Republicans are supportive of the new bill because [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=832.14s)]
*  they say that compared to the Texas law, which bans the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=837.66s)]
*  theirs is a whole 15 weeks, a time difference that they call generous. According to Florida [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=843.42s)]
*  House Republican Dana Trebulsi, 15 weeks is quote, a long time, end quote, even if it's less than the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=850.78s)]
*  24-week time limit that Roe v. Wade guarantees for women to get an abortion. Florida Republicans say, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=859.0999999999999s)]
*  hey, this bill is a compromise bill, even though it provides no exceptions for pregnancies resulting [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=865.66s)]
*  from rape, incest or human trafficking. State Senator Kelly Stargill says, quote, we're not [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=870.38s)]
*  banning anything. We're not being mean. We're not being mean. Chill out, guys. It's generous, not mean. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=876.14s)]
*  The bill passed a Florida Senate committee last week. A state House committee, subcommittee, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=882.38s)]
*  advanced the bill earlier this week. The state House Health and Human Services Committee held [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=886.7s)]
*  its first hearing on the bill on Thursday. Now, they asked for public testimony. When it came time [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=891.66s)]
*  for public testimony, several Florida residents had a lot to say about this generous bill. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=897.58s)]
*  It is so exhausting trying to find new ways to beg you to hear my pleas, to protect my right to [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=905.0200000000001s)]
*  choose. There should be no room, no right for anyone, especially any politician, and more [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=911.26s)]
*  specifically, any male politician to interfere in that very intimate moment and tell a woman what to [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=917.6600000000001s)]
*  do. As a woman of color, a wife, and a mom of three, this bill is taking away the access and [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=924.86s)]
*  choice that people in this state should respectfully have. I drove two and a half hours this morning [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=930.14s)]
*  from my college town in Gainesville to ask you why. Why do you feel the need to make decisions [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=935.5s)]
*  on women's bodies? Outlawing and further restricting abortion by passing this bill would not bring [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=940.22s)]
*  wellness to the people of Florida. 15 weeks is an undue burden. I was raped my freshman year of college. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=944.7s)]
*  Afterwards, I felt like no matter what I did, I didn't have agency or control over my own body, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=951.9000000000001s)]
*  and that's how I feel again today sitting in this room. It's really not your business why someone [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=956.22s)]
*  cares and wants to have an abortion. What should be your business is providing health care, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=960.5400000000001s)]
*  housing, therapy, and child care for expecting parents. Please vote no on HB5. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=965.0200000000001s)]
*  Even after all that testimony, the committee voted to advance the bill. Now it's going to go [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=970.62s)]
*  to the full House for consideration on Tuesday. Democrats say they will oppose it, but they are [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=974.62s)]
*  as we have discussed several times on this show in the minority. Joining us now is the Florida [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=979.58s)]
*  State Representative, Ana Escamani, a Democrat who opposes the bill that the House will vote on next [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=983.4200000000001s)]
*  week. Representative Escamani, good to see you. Thank you for joining us again tonight. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=988.62s)]
*  Thanks for having me. What can happen here? This is another situation in which Florida Republicans [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=993.9000000000001s)]
*  have a plan and they've got the numbers. So what does your sustained fight look like? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=999.26s)]
*  Well, first of all, Ali, there's no such thing as a generous or reasonable abortion ban. This is [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1005.34s)]
*  complete gaslighted by Republican colleagues who will do anything to ban abortion, even if it takes [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1010.54s)]
*  them step by step, bill by bill. This is a dangerous agenda that would force those seeking [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1017.5s)]
*  to access an abortion beyond 15 weeks in Florida to go to North Carolina as there's closest option, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1022.94s)]
*  assuming North Carolina doesn't ban abortion as well. So what does that look like? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1029.02s)]
*  And of course, as Democrats, the minority, our options are to fight like hell to do what we can [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1034.86s)]
*  to not only delay the passage of this bill, but to, of course, amplify public attention. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1040.06s)]
*  The reality is that Republicans know that banning abortion is not popular in Florida, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1045.58s)]
*  and that's why they continuously try to avoid calling this what it is, a ban on abortion. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1050.2199999999998s)]
*  So you mentioned this idea that some people may have to go to North Carolina. Let's spell [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1055.1799999999998s)]
*  out the reality of this. There were a lot of women who testified there who said, look, this [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1059.9s)]
*  is a hardship. This is difficult, but that's the goal, right? The goal is to make abortions [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1064.7800000000002s)]
*  inaccessible, particularly for people who do not have the luxury of traveling to states and [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1069.9s)]
*  extra gas and housing and waiting periods and tests that are not necessary. But that's [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1074.7800000000002s)]
*  actually the intent of this bill. Absolutely. First of all, abortion access is already highly [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1081.26s)]
*  restricted in Florida as we're seeing that trend in conservative states across America. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1087.58s)]
*  And the reality is that abortion bans impact every type of person. But as you mentioned, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1092.06s)]
*  those who have access to means will find a way to express bodily autonomy, have that agency, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1096.6999999999998s)]
*  and decide the outcome of their pregnancy. It's going to be those of no wealth, those who are [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1102.78s)]
*  people of color, undocumented, folks with disabilities, minors, folks who live in foster [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1108.54s)]
*  care. These are going to be the populations of Floridians who will truly have no other alternative [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1113.98s)]
*  and are going to be either forced to travel out of state or forced to become parents, which they [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1119.5s)]
*  know they're not ready or they don't wish to pursue. And so we're locking people deeper into [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1124.94s)]
*  poverty. There's already so much research that helps us understand what happens when someone [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1129.34s)]
*  cannot make a personal decision about their pregnancy. The outcomes are dangerous. The [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1134.22s)]
*  outcomes are systematically brutal. And this really is a bill that tries to punish poor people for [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1138.7s)]
*  being poor. You did tweet that your House Democrats have filed 17 amendments. Do those [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1143.82s)]
*  amendments do anything? Do those amendments, first of all, will any of them be considered? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1149.6599999999999s)]
*  And if they were to take place, would they change this bill meaningfully? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1153.6599999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. And I worked at Planned Parenthood for six years before I ran for office. I was a [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1159.58s)]
*  Planned Parenthood patient before then. These issues are personal to me, not only as a woman [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1164.54s)]
*  and someone of reproductive age, but as someone who cares about the next generation of Floridians [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1169.34s)]
*  who deserve full bodily autonomy. The 17 amendments that we have filed range from removing the ban [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1173.98s)]
*  to adding more exceptions, doing whatever we can to not only amplify how dangerous this bill is, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1179.4199999999998s)]
*  but to hopefully, of course, make it less harmful if it does actually become law. And we wish to [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1185.34s)]
*  set this up for litigation because we do know this is unconstitutional. We're going to do everything [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1190.54s)]
*  we can for the American people to know that. Florida State Representative Anna Eskamani, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1194.86s)]
*  thank you for your time tonight. We appreciate it. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLngQnMTIKc&t=1199.1799999999998s)]
