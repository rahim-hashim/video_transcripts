Video Description: Rachel Maddow argues that as Republican leaders discredit elections and encourage the abandonment of democracy, the option they are tacitly endorsing for how to run a government is force and violence, a value seen in the reactions of many Republicans to the attempted murder of the husband of the speaker of the House.

# GOP Rejection Of Democracy Leaves Force And Violence As Remaining Governing Option
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ)
*  NBC News reports that Paul Pelosi is still in the ICU tonight, after the attack surrounded [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  by family members. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=5.4s)]
*  He's 82 years old. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  He reportedly has extensive injuries to multiple body parts, including a fractured skull. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=8.56s)]
*  Donald Trump Jr. responded to the attack by saying he was working on his Paul Pelosi Halloween [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=16.96s)]
*  costume. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=22.48s)]
*  And he posted a picture of a hammer and a pair of underwear. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=23.48s)]
*  And he posted another picture of a hammer saying it was for open carry in San Francisco. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=27.84s)]
*  That's the son of former President Trump. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=33.36s)]
*  Charlie Kirk, who's the head of a big pro-Trump conservative PAC, he said today that some [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=37.0s)]
*  amazing patriot—that was his phrase—amazing patriot should post bail for the attacker, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=43.32s)]
*  and that person would be a midterm hero if they did it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=48.84s)]
*  Mary Lake is the Republican candidate for governor in Arizona. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=54.96s)]
*  She got a big laugh, big round of applause on this subject this weekend. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=58.44s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi—well, she's got protection when she's in the D.C. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=62.0s)]
*  Apparently her house doesn't have a lot of protection. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=66.88s)]
*  But— [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=70.04s)]
*  Big laugh line for her. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=73.64s)]
*  Play that tape again. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=75.12s)]
*  You can see the moderator of the event on the left side of your screen. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=77.16s)]
*  It looks like he's laughing so hard he might fall over. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=79.72s)]
*  Oh, it's just hilarious fracturing his skull with a hammer. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=83.12s)]
*  There's been a lot of reporting already about the assailant, his perceived beliefs, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  his writings online—his writing online. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=96.28s)]
*  To use a technical term, I would say he seems like a nutball. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  That's how I would classify him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=105.2s)]
*  But his recent writings, you know, for what it's worth, they're all conspiracy theories [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=106.36s)]
*  and rantings that circulate on the far right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  Holocaust denial, Jewish bankers, COVID vaccines are a conspiracy. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=113.88s)]
*  QAnon stuff, he wrote, Q is Trump himself. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  And the real racism is racism against white people. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=123.44s)]
*  And, you know, I dismiss him as a nutball and I speak about those things with admitted [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=128.0s)]
*  derision because, in my opinion, honestly, none of us should feel obliged to play in [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=132.68s)]
*  the sewer of that man's mind. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=137.28s)]
*  Once you hit someone in the head with a hammer, all of humanity is officially and forever [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=139.2s)]
*  excused from needing to learn about your thoughts and feelings. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=144.52s)]
*  But if you're a person who has all your faculties and you know that something like [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  this has happened, if you minimize it, mock it, celebrate it, the attempted murder of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=153.04s)]
*  the Speaker of the House's husband, what is now formally charged as the attempted kidnapping [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=161.0s)]
*  of the Speaker of the House? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=165.76s)]
*  Well, if that's how you react to knowing this has happened, well, then you're telling [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  us what you want instead of politics. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=173.32s)]
*  You're telling everybody what you want to be able to do, what you want your side to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=176.52s)]
*  be able to do to your political opponents, what you enjoy seeing your political opponents [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=180.28s)]
*  subjected to. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=186.36s)]
*  And that is, in fact, the other option if we're not going to have elections anymore. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=189.32s)]
*  It's either violence in force or it's voting. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=194.12s)]
*  And if it is not voting, then it is going to be violence in force. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=197.44s)]
*  We're eight days out from the first national election since the last Republican president, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=203.12s)]
*  the leader of their party, tried to stay in power by force. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=208.44s)]
*  And you know, on Friday, a man pled guilty in federal court to threatening to kill Congressman [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=214.88s)]
*  Eric Swalwell and his staff. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=219.16s)]
*  So last week, three people were just found guilty of their part in a militia kidnapping [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  plot targeting the governor of Michigan. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=225.64s)]
*  Today, Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn testified in the seditious conspiracy trial of the pro-Trump [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=228.04s)]
*  paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, for their role in Trump's effort to have a violent [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  mob of his supporters overthrow the government and keep him in power by force. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=237.76s)]
*  In power, by force, despite the election results. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=242.92s)]
*  In power, despite the election results and therefore by force. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=247.54s)]
*  Those are the choices, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=254.06s)]
*  It's either elections or it's force and violence. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=258.3s)]
*  We are eight days out. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=262.52s)]
*  In this election, a clear majority of Republican candidates for congressional and statewide [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=263.94s)]
*  offices say election results should no longer count. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  They do not believe in election results. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=272.34s)]
*  And below that level, in state legislative races, look, clear majorities of Republican [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=275.86s)]
*  candidates in those races in the swing states, they say election results shouldn't count. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  They don't believe them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=285.3s)]
*  We shouldn't use elections anymore. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=286.3s)]
*  If they do not want us to have elections anymore, don't kid yourself that there is another good [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=288.16s)]
*  option. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=292.18s)]
*  It is democracy or it's not. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=293.18s)]
*  And if it's not, it's violence and force. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=295.90000000000003s)]
*  This is the year. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=303.54s)]
*  This is the election when your vote, up and down to the very bottom of the ballot, is [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=304.98s)]
*  an answer to this one question. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=309.74s)]
*  Is it democracy or is it force and violence? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  Our vote this year is about whether we ever get to vote again. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=315.86s)]
*  This is not the year to sit out. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6HYA4q6qLQ&t=320.24s)]
