# 'Like no nightmare I can ever imagine': Israeli seeks help in the return of his abducted family
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38)
*  We're going to start tonight with a story that is very much still developing, very much still [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=0.0s)]
*  unresolved and very personal to our first guest. This is Yair Yaakov and Mirav Tal. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=4.48s)]
*  They live on a kibbutz in southern Israel, a kibbutz called Near Oz. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=12.56s)]
*  And Yair's sons are 16 and 12 years old. Orr is the big brother. He's 16. Yagil is the younger son. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=17.84s)]
*  He's 12. And on Saturday morning at 8 45 a.m. local time, so this is just a couple of hours [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=26.72s)]
*  after the Hamas terrorist attacks started in southern Israel, Yair got on the phone with his [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=34.16s)]
*  sister-in-law from the kibbutz. And he told his sister-in-law that he and his girlfriend were in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=41.84s)]
*  a shelter inside their house. They were going to try to ride out these bombings that had just started. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=48.0s)]
*  He said his two sons, his 12 year old and his 16 year old, they were not with them. They were with [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=53.6s)]
*  their mother at a different house on the kibbutz. And Yair said that the plan was that everybody was [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=60.32s)]
*  going to stay put until the bombings stopped. And then they would find each other and get back together. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=65.6s)]
*  Stay safe. Then about a half hour later another communication, and this time it was from Yair's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=72.4s)]
*  girlfriend. It was from Mirav. And she texted out an audio message and it was terrifying. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=78.48s)]
*  She said there were two terrorists inside the house. They had guns. They were shooting. She said [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=86.16s)]
*  Yair was trying to hold back the door to the shelter so that the terrorists could not get in. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=92.0s)]
*  And that was the end of it. After that they lost connection. So Yair's brother tried calling them [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=98.0s)]
*  back. He also tried that thing where you try to locate somebody's phone to try to figure out where [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=104.64s)]
*  his brother and his girlfriend were exactly. He was not able to find them that way. Later in the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=111.04s)]
*  afternoon he was able to get in contact with the boy's mother again. Again, she had been with the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=116.32s)]
*  two sons in a different house on the kibbutz. She said she had been contacted by two kidnappers [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=122.32s)]
*  who made the 16-year-old boy or get on the phone and tell his mom that he had been kidnapped. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=130.16s)]
*  Then he hung up. So the long and the short of this is that all four of these people, Yair [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=136.24s)]
*  and his two sons and Yair's girlfriend, they have now all been reported missing by Yair's brother [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=144.16s)]
*  Yanev. And Yanev says the whole family has been missing as far as they know since basically midday [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=150.64s)]
*  on Saturday. He has not heard from them since. Except there has been an additional electronic [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=157.2s)]
*  communication of the worst kind. Yanev says he has been sent a video which appears to show his [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=163.6s)]
*  brother Yair and his brother's girlfriend being kidnapped on Saturday morning. Since the attack on [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=169.92s)]
*  Israel started on Saturday morning, we have seen these murders and hostage takings of civilians and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=176.32s)]
*  otherwise. We have seen them being filmed and put online for a strategic aim, right, to advance [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=184.0s)]
*  the purposes of the people who are doing the murdering and the hostage taking. And so when [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=193.12s)]
*  it comes to the footage that these people are producing of their killing and kidnapping people, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=197.92s)]
*  that puts every social media company on earth and it puts everybody in the news business in the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=204.48s)]
*  position of potentially doing their work by showing what they are doing because they want [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=210.4s)]
*  it to be seen. They want that to augment the terrorizing effect of what they are doing to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=216.08s)]
*  these innocent people. Now, on the other hand, the people whose families have been victimized [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=223.28s)]
*  in this way are in some cases asking us to please show these videos, to please show this stuff, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=228.72s)]
*  because they believe it should be, A, known that this is happening and B, because in some cases [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=234.72s)]
*  they believe it could potentially help them get their loved ones home safely. So being in the middle [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=240.24s)]
*  of that, not wanting to advance the cause of the people who not only did these things but filmed [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=246.56s)]
*  them for a reason and the people who are saying, please show the footage that shows the difficult [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=250.96s)]
*  situation that our family members are in, we believe it could help. That is a very difficult [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  thing to reckon with. All of these decisions are hard ones. I don't think there is a right decision. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=261.76s)]
*  In this specific case of Yair and Mirov and the two boys, Yair's brother has asked us to show this [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=267.12s)]
*  video, which appears to depict his brother and his brother's girlfriend being abducted on Saturday. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=272.56s)]
*  So we are going to play it with no sound. It was uploaded with propaganda style music. We do not [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  need to broadcast that. You also don't need to hear the human exclamations and fear from the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=284.32s)]
*  people who are in this situation. Even without the sound, I think it goes without saying that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=290.48s)]
*  even without the sound, I think it goes without saying this video is disturbing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=295.04s)]
*  It's about 30 seconds. We're going to show it now. Again, it does not have sound. It does have sound, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  but rather we are not playing that sound. But it's 28 seconds. Here we go. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  Again, this is the video that was sent to the brother of Yair, the man you saw at the end of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=325.04s)]
*  the video there along with his girlfriend at the first part of that video. Joining us now from [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=344.16s)]
*  southern Israel is Yair's brother, Yanev Yaakov, who shared this video and photos of his family [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=349.04s)]
*  with us. Mr. Yaakov, I can't imagine the anguish that you and your family are going through. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=353.92s)]
*  Thank you for talking to us. I want to give you the opportunity first to correct me if I said [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=359.68s)]
*  anything wrong there or characterized anything the wrong way around. Well, thank you for having me. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=365.2s)]
*  That's the first. It's a very hard situation. It's a very hard time right now. You've put [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=372.24s)]
*  most of the things intact exactly like they were besides one fact that the mother wasn't [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=378.4s)]
*  at the kibbutz. She was in another kibbutz that was also attacked. And luckily, she and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=386.64s)]
*  my brother's daughter are safe. All the rest of them are kidnapped, like I said. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=394.88s)]
*  But what we need now, really need is that the government of Israel and everyone who can force [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=403.76s)]
*  or squeeze or do something to make sure that everyone would work for them to get back our [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=414.47999999999996s)]
*  family, get back our loved ones. That should be the top priority. Nothing else. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=426.4s)]
*  All the rest will come later. We can talk about a lot of things, but right now, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=433.68s)]
*  we need them back home safe and sound. We really, really need someone to talk to us, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=439.12s)]
*  to have a dialogue with us, just to have something to grab on. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=449.52s)]
*  This is like no nightmare that I can ever imagine. Every hour, every minute we get [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=458.4s)]
*  notifications from friends that their loved ones were killed or their loved ones are not [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  seen at the moment. It is so hard to even explain how we feel. We are broken. We are [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  terrified with what happened. We didn't imagine in our worst nightmares that this kind of thing [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=485.12s)]
*  could happen. And we didn't imagine in our worst nightmares that someone can react or [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=494.96s)]
*  can behave to human beings like they do. Have you heard anything—I'm sorry to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=502.32s)]
*  interrupt you. Let me just ask you briefly. You mentioned that you needed help trying to create [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=511.04s)]
*  dialogue. Have you heard anything from officials or law enforcement or the government about [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=516.16s)]
*  what you should do now, about whether they want you to be speaking publicly, about anything [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=522.4s)]
*  strategically in terms of how to try to help? No, and that's the reason we, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=528.24s)]
*  as families, all the families that have missing persons, gather together in order to get some [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=537.04s)]
*  help from somewhere. We know that there are a lot of countries that have people who are either [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=547.04s)]
*  casualty or are being held by Hamas. And I believe that if the whole world or, let's say, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=556.4s)]
*  the president of Turkey or Saudi Arabia, someone that are close and can talk to the Hamas would [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=568.16s)]
*  force them to move or do something to bring our families back. This is what we're trying to do. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  We're trying to get our beloved ones back. That's the main purpose of our gathering, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=583.28s)]
*  because we didn't get any notification or any guidance, like you said, from anyone. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=592.8s)]
*  We decided to do it on our own. Well, thank you for trusting us to show these images and to tell [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=599.92s)]
*  this story. Please keep us apprised. I wish I could say something more concrete in terms of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=608.48s)]
*  what we can offer, but please stay in touch with us and let us know. And I hope you hear something [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  soon. Thank you so much. Thank you for letting us be here and show our pain. I hope this will [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=619.2s)]
*  help eventually. Thank you. So do we. Yanov Yakov joining us tonight live from southern Israel. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiSxOaQXU38&t=629.84s)]
