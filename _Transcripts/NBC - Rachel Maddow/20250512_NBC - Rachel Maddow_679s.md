# Why Donald Trump's medical records say more than he realizes
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k)
*  So I'm about to talk about something I feel a little oogie talking about, because it seems [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=0.0s)]
*  personal. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=6.08s)]
*  But it turns out—the reason I'm going to do it, the reason I feel okay about it, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=7.08s)]
*  actually, is that it's explicitly not personal in the end. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  It's about the country, it's about policy, it's about the health of literally tens [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=17.6s)]
*  of millions of Americans. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=20.56s)]
*  It does start in a kind of personal place. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=22.76s)]
*  So, again, slight oog factor here, but work with me. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=25.12s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=28.72s)]
*  We have had on this show many times before former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=29.72s)]
*  He's a big deal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=35.08s)]
*  He has served multiple presidents, Democrat and Republican. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=37.0s)]
*  As I said, former commissioner of the FDA. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=40.56s)]
*  He was most recently a very senior science adviser to President Biden. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  David Kessler has been the dean of the medical school at Yale and at UC San Francisco. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  David Kessler, as I say, a very big deal. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=50.56s)]
*  And as a medical doctor, Dr. Kessler recently looked at the report from President Trump's [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=53.32s)]
*  own annual physical last month. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  And to him, that report told a story, a good news story, that he thought more Americans [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=63.08s)]
*  should know about. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=68.64s)]
*  This is from a piece that Dr. Kessler wrote for The Atlantic. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=70.72s)]
*  It has just published in the past few minutes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=74.04s)]
*  He says, quote, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=77.08s)]
*  which put him at risk of a heart attack. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=83.36s)]
*  In 2020, his BMI, his body mass index, was just over the threshold for obesity. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=85.24s)]
*  That combination would have made him a candidate for a GLP-1 drug. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=90.76s)]
*  That is a weight loss drug like ozempic or Wigovie. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=94.36s)]
*  Quote, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=97.84s)]
*  Then, last month, Trump's latest physical showed that he had dropped 20 pounds, which [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=104.32s)]
*  moved him from obese to overweight. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=108.6s)]
*  Trump has never publicly said he is on a GLP-1, and when reached for comment, the White [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=112.12s)]
*  House did not address questions about how the president lost the weight. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=116.04s)]
*  Press Secretary Caroline Levitt said Trump is, quote, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=119.68s)]
*  I'll tell you, we also reached out to the White House for comment. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  We got that exact same response about what a brilliant specimen of man he is. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=128.36s)]
*  But Dr. Kessler goes on to say this, quote, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=133.28s)]
*  This is a combination that amounts to what doctors call intensive lipid lowering therapy, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=142.12s)]
*  a treatment usually reserved for patients who are at significant risk of cardiac disease. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=148.12s)]
*  That drug regimen seems to be working. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=154.24s)]
*  His LDL, the bad cholesterol, has dropped dramatically in recent years. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=156.32s)]
*  So what Dr. David Kessler says he sees in President Trump's medical report is a success [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=161.52s)]
*  success against conditions that tens of millions of Americans struggle with, namely obesity [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=168.52s)]
*  and cardiac disease. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=174.08s)]
*  And that success, that progress in the president's own health report appears to be largely thanks [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=176.6s)]
*  to medical science. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=182.28s)]
*  The president is on these two cholesterol-lowering drugs, this intensive lipid-lowering therapy [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=184.36s)]
*  for people at risk of cardiac disease. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=191.32s)]
*  That treatment really appears to be working for him. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  We do not know if the president's documented weight loss is thanks to ozimbic or Wigovia [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=196.04s)]
*  or any similar drug. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  Certainly, no shame if it is. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=203.0s)]
*  Any such drug is not listed in his medical report. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=205.84s)]
*  The White House will not say one way or the other when they are asked. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=208.12s)]
*  And I know I said this was a little oogie to talk about because this feels personal. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=212.76s)]
*  But the point of this is not necessarily the president's personal health. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=216.32s)]
*  The point here is that the president of the United States appears to be improving his [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  own health through access to great medical care and great medical science. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=225.08s)]
*  That's what he gets. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  Simultaneously, his administration is doing so much to hurt regular Americans' opportunity [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  to achieve those same good health outcomes the same way. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  The National Institutes of Health, the government research agency that produces much of the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  science for these specific drugs and countless others, Trump has slashed its budget and nearly [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=248.12s)]
*  $2 billion in research grants there have been canceled. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=254.88s)]
*  The FDA shepherds drugs to market and makes sure they are safe. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=259.6s)]
*  The FDA is reeling from huge staffing cuts and the staff that is there can't complete [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=263.12s)]
*  basic tasks because, among other things, their government credit cards have been frozen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=268.64s)]
*  Trump and his allies in Congress are currently debating how many hundreds of billions of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=274.84s)]
*  dollars they're going to cut from Medicaid, which provides health insurance to tens of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=279.36s)]
*  millions of Americans. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=283.88s)]
*  And as for those GLP-1 weight loss drugs that can be a lifesaver for so many people, well, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=285.6s)]
*  Trump has rescinded a Biden administration proposal to have those drugs covered by Medicare. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=291.88s)]
*  Even as the White House says, maybe weight loss drugs will get a big price cut, they'll [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=299.4s)]
*  solve it with deals, if you want to believe that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=303.08s)]
*  But they're undoing the plan to have them covered by Medicare, which puts at risk the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=306.12s)]
*  opportunity for tens of millions of Americans to benefit from those kinds of drugs. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=311.6s)]
*  President Trump is personally benefiting in his own health from the scientific and medical [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=318.24s)]
*  infrastructure the U.S. government has built up over decades. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=322.84s)]
*  He is simultaneously in the process of destroying that infrastructure for everyone else. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=327.32s)]
*  Joining us now is former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=334.96s)]
*  He has a new book that is coming out tomorrow. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=337.68s)]
*  It's called Diet, Drugs and Dopamine, the New Science of Achieving a Healthy Weight. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  Dr. David Kessler, congratulations on the book. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=345.44s)]
*  First of all, let me say I brought home the galley when I last saw you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  I read it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=352.56s)]
*  My partner read it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=353.48s)]
*  We then handed it to a neighbor who also wanted to read it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=354.16s)]
*  I really appreciate you writing this, particularly given your expertise in this field and so [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=356.8s)]
*  many others. Thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=360.16s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=361.48s)]
*  So first, let me just ask you if I accurately represented your take on the president's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=364.12s)]
*  medical report and why you think it's worth understanding in terms of how he is governing, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=369.28s)]
*  how he is managing health policy in the country. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=375.0s)]
*  You know, weight is such a fraught subject. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=378.64s)]
*  There's so much stigma attached to it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=381.64s)]
*  But it's not about weight. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=384.88s)]
*  It's really about health. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  You got the facts exactly right. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=388.84s)]
*  Let's just go through them. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=390.91999999999996s)]
*  The president had a cardiac scan that showed some plaque buildup, and they put him on two [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  lipid-lowering drugs. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  What no one has said about those two lipid-lowering drugs is what those are called is intensive [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=400.72s)]
*  lipid-lowering therapy, azetamide or suvastatin, and they're working. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=406.52s)]
*  Lipids drop dramatically, from 143 to 51. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=413.48s)]
*  That reduces the risk of heart attack. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=419.44s)]
*  That prolongs life. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=421.44s)]
*  But the key, as you said, is the science of those drugs was worked out by research funded [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=423.64s)]
*  by the NIH and shepherded by the FDA. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=431.96s)]
*  The president is destroying those institutions that gave birth to the drugs that are benefiting [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=437.28s)]
*  him. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=444.24s)]
*  I think we tend to think of drug development as the province of private companies, of pharmaceutical [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=446.84s)]
*  companies. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=453.48s)]
*  Can you explain to an audience that may not understand the sort of weight of what you [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=454.48s)]
*  just said, can you talk about the federal government's role in researching and creating [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=458.56s)]
*  drugs and getting them to the American people, the part of it that can't happen without [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=462.92s)]
*  the U.S. government? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=466.76s)]
*  So a drug has to work on a certain target. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=468.36s)]
*  And while the drug companies will chemically synthesize the drug and do the clinical trials, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=471.48s)]
*  the identification of that target, the receptor, I mean, that was done by research funded. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=479.06s)]
*  It was Nobel Prize winning work by Brown and Goldstein. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=486.26s)]
*  They identified, you know, through NIH funding, because no drug company has that capability. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=490.06s)]
*  They identified the receptors that the drugs can work on. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=497.76s)]
*  It was also true for the current weight loss drugs. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=501.12s)]
*  The GLP-1 drugs were done by a number of research labs, including a great research lab up at [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=503.74s)]
*  Harvard at Mass General Hospital. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=513.26s)]
*  When you were last here, Dr. Kessler, you said something that got a very large response [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=518.34s)]
*  from our audience. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=522.98s)]
*  People continue to ask me about it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=523.98s)]
*  You talked about when President Trump himself had COVID during his first term, and he was [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=526.42s)]
*  very ill. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=530.58s)]
*  We learned later just how seriously ill he was. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=531.86s)]
*  And you talked about his treatment, a very successful treatment, at Walter Reed when [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=535.66s)]
*  he received monoclonal antibody infusions. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=539.46s)]
*  And you broke the news on our show that the doctor who made it possible for Trump to get [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=542.9s)]
*  that treatment, which very well could have saved his life, is one of the officials at [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=549.62s)]
*  the FDA, one of the officials in the federal government, who Trump had fired. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=558.26s)]
*  And it seems like it's following the sort of same lines that you're describing here [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=563.58s)]
*  today, something which he's benefiting from, which may have indeed saved his life, is something [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=568.5s)]
*  that he's cutting off in terms of the ability for that expertise to continue to benefit [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=572.9s)]
*  not just himself, but the American people. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=579.9399999999999s)]
*  I feel like I'm seeing continuities between those two stories, but I wanted to ask you [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=582.62s)]
*  if you see it that way. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=586.4399999999999s)]
*  I think you've got it exactly. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  I was told this weekend that there are six, seven hundred recusals today at FDA. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=591.0799999999999s)]
*  That means recusals, you have to submit those when you're looking for jobs. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=597.72s)]
*  So there is an exodus. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=604.16s)]
*  That kind of expertise, those nights that I was on with you when we were facing COVID, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=606.0s)]
*  we got through those because I was able to rely, when I was co-leading Operation Warp [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=613.56s)]
*  Speed on a great deal of expertise. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=620.64s)]
*  The Trump administration is going to need to rely on those expertise. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=622.9599999999999s)]
*  They just haven't figured that out yet. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=627.0s)]
*  There are going to be moments where they're going to turn around and find no one is there [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=629.3199999999999s)]
*  with that kind of expertise, and that should concern all of us. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=633.56s)]
*  Dr. David Kessler, former FDA commissioner and so much else, long record of service in [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=638.48s)]
*  our government at the highest levels of our health infrastructure. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=644.72s)]
*  Dr. Kessler's new book is out tomorrow. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=647.28s)]
*  It's called Diet, Drugs and Dopamine, the New Science of Achieving a Healthy Weight. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=649.44s)]
*  Dr. Kessler, as always, it's an honor to have you here whenever you can be here. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=653.6s)]
*  Thanks for being here tonight. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=657.2s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrtMbgf49k&t=658.8000000000001s)]
