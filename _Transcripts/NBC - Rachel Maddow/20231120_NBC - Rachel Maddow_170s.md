# Like all the dashboard warning lights going off: Confluence of developments make for scary times
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M)
*  This news comes tonight at a time when literal neo-Nazis, dudes with big swastika flags, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=0.0s)]
*  were marching in Wisconsin this weekend, rallying outside a historic Jewish site in downtown [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=7.0s)]
*  Madison, Wisconsin. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=12.0s)]
*  That was Saturday this weekend. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=13.0s)]
*  Then the very next day, Sunday morning, a grenade was found strapped to a pole outside [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=15.9s)]
*  a synagogue in Lakewood, New Jersey. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=20.34s)]
*  Today federal charges were filed against a Utah man who allegedly made multiple death [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=23.94s)]
*  threats to an organization in D.C. advocating for Palestinian rights. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=28.34s)]
*  This comes at a time when the Israel-Hamas war feels just like an unceasing bloodbath [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=34.78s)]
*  at this point, with Hamas still holding Israelis hostage for a month and a half now, with the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=41.06s)]
*  death toll inside Gaza now estimated at over 13,000 people killed, with one and a half [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  million people displaced in Gaza from their homes with nowhere to go, slim to no hope [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=53.22s)]
*  that there will be anywhere for them to return to at all at any time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=58.339999999999996s)]
*  The moral calamity and the ongoing catastrophe in that war has caused such suffering and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=63.66s)]
*  death there and such grief and outrage around the world here in the United States that has [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=70.38s)]
*  correlated not just with grief and outrage, but with a major spike in hate crimes committed [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=75.22s)]
*  by Americans against other Americans. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=80.06s)]
*  Which makes it just an extra-auspicious time for the richest man in the world to be using [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=83.22s)]
*  his media outlet to tell the world effectively that white people have an enemy in the Jews. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=87.02s)]
*  For Republican political figures to say that they might like to lock up anyone in the media [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=93.9s)]
*  who criticizes him for that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=98.30000000000001s)]
*  For the leader of the Republican party to be promising treason investigations for his [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=100.54s)]
*  perceived critics in the media. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=104.6s)]
*  And also that he's going to use the U.S. Army against American civilians who protest [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=106.82s)]
*  against him. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  And also that he's going to build camps in America in which he's going to lock up millions [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  of people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  Because he wants power again so he can crush his enemies and root out what he calls the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=117.1s)]
*  vermin in this country, the people who oppose him, the internal threat. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  It is of course never a good time for any of this, but the fact that this is all happening [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=129.14s)]
*  at once right now. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=133.38s)]
*  It's like the difference between one warning light going off on your dashboard while you're [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=135.86s)]
*  driving and all the warning lights going off all at once while you're driving, right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=140.38s)]
*  When the latter happens you pull over because obviously this is serious. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLVb5N-qk7M&t=145.3s)]
