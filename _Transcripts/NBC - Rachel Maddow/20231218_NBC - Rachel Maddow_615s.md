Video Description: Rachel Maddow makes the case that the reason Donald Trump does not change his talking points when people point out that his words are echoing Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini is that Trump knows (and new polling of Republican voters shows) how powerfully appealing some people find the ideas that language frames. But just as past democracies found ways to resist autocrats, so too can Americans adopt practices that sap the power of Trump's appeal.

# Maddow: Why does Trump keep talking like a fascist? Because it works.
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA)
*  You know, nobody is a Nazi but a Nazi. Nobody is Hitler but Hitler. Nobody is Mussolini but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=0.0s)]
*  Mussolini, right? There's no point in making—and there's no cause to make any sort of modern [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=5.12s)]
*  analogy to the fascist dictatorships of the 1930s. But we are having this weird moment in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=10.56s)]
*  American news and politics right now, where half the country is shouting about how the Republican [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=18.96s)]
*  presidential nominee keeps quoting those dictators. He keeps saying the kinds of things, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=24.159999999999997s)]
*  the exact kind of things that Hitler and Mussolini said as they ascended to and consolidated power. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=29.839999999999996s)]
*  And you see those—the names of those dictators and you see the discussion of that period in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=36.48s)]
*  history all over the news right now because he is saying those things. He is effectively quoting [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  Mussolini and Hitler in some of their most effective propagandistic tactics. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=46.8s)]
*  But pointing out that he's saying Hitler-esque and Mussolini-esque things turns out [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=51.36s)]
*  to not be enough to make him stop saying those things. He doesn't mind being compared to those [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=59.36s)]
*  people. Why is he willing to keep saying those things despite everybody pointing out, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=64.4s)]
*  hey, that's what Hitler said, hey, that's what Mussolini said, you don't want to be a Hitler or [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=72.8s)]
*  a Mussolini, do you? Why is it not enough to stop him from using those tactics, from saying those [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=77.36s)]
*  things, from trying to make people think about the world that way? It's not enough because those [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=86.08s)]
*  things work for him. There is a reason that it is—you know, it's dictators and authoritarians who [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=94.08s)]
*  talk about their internal enemies being vermin who have to be rooted out or exterminated. There's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=101.44s)]
*  a reason that it's dictators and authoritarians who talk about immigrants poisoning the blood of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=106.8s)]
*  the country. There's a reason they do it, which is that it works on people. It makes people want [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=112.0s)]
*  to put a strong man in charge to break all the rules and destroy those very scary enemies, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=116.8s)]
*  Iron fist. There's been all this discussion, I know, in the past few days about the former president, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=122.64s)]
*  the Republican presidential frontrunner playing this fascist dictator greatest hits mix tape, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  right? I do want to be a dictator. I will root out the vermin amongst us, the Marxist communist [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=135.52s)]
*  vermin. You know, immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country. There's been a lot of [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  discussion about that in recent days, and there should be. But pointing at it and saying, that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  sounds really dictator-y, isn't enough, right? Why is it that even after everybody pointed out [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  that those were Hitler-esque and Mussolini-esque statements, he kept doing them, right? These are [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  things he has tried out in the last few weeks. He is now repeating them. He is putting them in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=163.36s)]
*  writing. He is making them part of his regular speeches. Why is he doing that? Because these [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=167.12s)]
*  things are getting a good response, a good response, a response that he likes, not just the outrage of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  his critics, which he likes, but the pleasure and support of the people who like him the most. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=177.36s)]
*  In a Des Moines Register poll this weekend, this is the Des Moines Register NBC News Media [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  Com Iowa poll this weekend. That poll asked Iowa Republicans about Trump's recent statements [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=190.0s)]
*  along these lines. The poll asked whether these comments from Trump would make you more or less [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=195.68s)]
*  likely to support him, Iowa Republican. And the answers are worth paying attention to. On his [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=203.68s)]
*  claim that immigrants are poisoning the blood of America, which is straight out of Mein Kampf. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=211.68s)]
*  On the vermin in the United States that needs to be rooted out, which comes straight out of the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=218.24s)]
*  playbook of Mussolini and Hitler. Even on his pledge to build giant camps to hold millions of [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=224.0s)]
*  people in this country. On those statements, Iowa Republican voters say as of this weekend [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=229.68s)]
*  that those statements from Trump make them more likely to vote for him, not less. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=234.8s)]
*  These things that Trump is saying right now, they sound familiar, not just because [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=241.84s)]
*  he's going for shock value, not just because he's going for the transgressive thrill of saying [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=247.28s)]
*  things that famous dictators and genocidal maniacs have said in the past. The reason these things [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=251.36s)]
*  sound familiar and he started to repeat them and started to make them part of his regular repertoire [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=258.32s)]
*  is because this stuff works. There's a reason Hitler and Mussolini said this stuff too. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=262.88s)]
*  It worked then, it works now. It has worked abroad all over the world and yes, it has worked here too, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=268.4s)]
*  more than we like to remember, which is why I wrote this book this year. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=274.96s)]
*  It's not just a bad and dangerous thing he's doing that you can stop him from doing by pointing out [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=280.88s)]
*  that it's bad and dangerous. This kind of rhetoric, trying to turn Americans, not just against each [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=286.0s)]
*  other, but to the idea that some people among us are so dangerous that they must be exterminated, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=293.84s)]
*  that some threats to us justify terminating the constitution, that justify being a dictator, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=301.12s)]
*  if only for a day. This is the sort of thing that has a political point. It is designed to make you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=307.2s)]
*  believe that a democratic system with checks and balances and the constraint of the rule of law [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=312.72s)]
*  and elections where people are voted out sometimes and divided power within government, those things [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=318.24s)]
*  are not up to stopping these terrible evils that threaten us, the terrible threat that some people [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=323.44s)]
*  among us pose to the rest of us. This stuff is tactically efficient. It's designed to make us [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=328.32s)]
*  think that we need a strong man, we need a tough man. We don't need a legal system and all its [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=335.2s)]
*  constraints. We don't need a court system. We don't really need a political process. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=339.92s)]
*  We don't need politicians. We don't need Congress. We need strength, will, action, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=343.6s)]
*  revenge, broken rules, maybe even violence. These statements are not just supposed to shock you, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=349.28s)]
*  they're supposed to work on you, to make you believe we need something new and extreme to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=357.12s)]
*  deal with our terrible problems, if only for a little while, maybe, maybe just a temporary [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=362.4s)]
*  dictatorship. And these tactics have a terrible history of working really well [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=367.44s)]
*  in other countries and yes, here in our past. Once you realize that it is a political tactic, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=374.64s)]
*  well, then how do you stop it from working? If it has worked well in the past, what have we learned [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=381.6s)]
*  from the past about how to stop it from working so well again? Well, it's not rocket science, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=387.20000000000005s)]
*  but it does take work and right now. I mean, I think it should hopefully go without saying that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  one thing that needs to be done is to refuse personally, individually, all of us, to play any [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=400.88s)]
*  part in any politics that depends on you thinking of your political opponents as monsters, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  to refuse to participate in any politics that depends on any group in society being seen as [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=415.84s)]
*  a menace, as something that needs to be eliminated or rooted out. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=421.12s)]
*  It means standing up for any group that is being targeted that way. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=427.76s)]
*  And yes, there is a role for regular citizens in that. Thank you to the Daphne Alabama Church [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=431.28s)]
*  that offered its church facilities, to the local synagogue down the road that had to flee in the [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=437.44s)]
*  face of that bomb threat before its own Saturday services this weekend. There's a space there for [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=442.56s)]
*  regular people, but there's also a place for law enforcement. As I said, the Massachusetts [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=450.48s)]
*  Attorney General is here next. It also means that the legal system has to be both used and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=454.88s)]
*  defended. Right? The legal system needs to play a role in prosecuting crimes, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=461.92s)]
*  upholding the idea that the rule of law still applies, and it needs to be protected from [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=469.52s)]
*  political pressure and intimidation. It also means we need to both use and defend the political [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=476.32s)]
*  system that we do have that the anti-democratic forces among us want us to abandon. When they [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=483.44s)]
*  attack not just election results, but election workers, that is part of breaking the small d [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=492.4s)]
*  democratic system, which of course makes it easier for us all to imagine throwing it away. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=498.4s)]
*  Tonight, Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss, two Georgia election workers, have sued Trump lawyer Rudy [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=506.24s)]
*  Giuliani again to stop him from defaming and attacking them further after a court awarded [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=512.08s)]
*  them $148 million in damages for his previous defamation and attacks. Protecting people like [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=518.96s)]
*  that, making sure that people like that are both protected and that the system works for them to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=527.12s)]
*  get justice, that's part of it too. Standing up for people who are being attacked and scapegoated, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  stopping violence and intimidation in the political system, both through solidarity at [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=538.4s)]
*  a regular human level, but also through law enforcement. Defending not just the idea of [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=542.24s)]
*  elections as an abstract, but the people who make elections work at a nuts and bolts level, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=547.04s)]
*  refusing to give into the idea that we're somehow different kinds of humans, that we need an iron [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=553.2s)]
*  fist to protect one another, to protect us from one another more than we need democracy. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=558.08s)]
*  You can't just object to these tactics and say, wow, that's what dictators of yore have used. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=563.12s)]
*  It's to recognize that dictators of yore have used those things because these tactics have been [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  effective at getting people to want to give up democracy and to put themselves in the hands [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=579.44s)]
*  of a strongman leader instead. It's recognizing that this stuff isn't just offensive, it works. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=585.92s)]
*  And it's not history, it's now. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FszsAnPOixA&t=591.76s)]
