# Threat Of Cyberattack On U.S. Infrastructure Takes More Serious Turn
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo)
*  Tonight, this joint security alert has been issued by the FBI, the NSA, National Security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=0.0s)]
*  Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  This is a big, urgent joint security alert just released tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=9.72s)]
*  And it's a technical alert, so I'm not going to quote from it too much directly, because [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=14.72s)]
*  it's all this technical stuff. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=18.6s)]
*  But the AP, I thought, summed it up well. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=19.8s)]
*  They described this alert as, quote, warning of the discovery of malicious cyber tools [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  that the agency said are capable of gaining full system access to multiple industrial [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=27.82s)]
*  control systems here in the United States and in North America. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=33.7s)]
*  In other words, the U.S. government tonight is urgently warning that someone, they're [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=38.18s)]
*  not saying who, but presumably Russia, has deployed malicious weapons that could shut [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=43.54s)]
*  down U.S. infrastructure. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=50.22s)]
*  Specifically, they say this thing is targeted at energy infrastructure in North America. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=51.58s)]
*  To get more specific than that, it is reportedly targeted at liquefied natural gas facilities [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  and our electrical grids. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=61.739999999999995s)]
*  One security company, Mandiant, says we should understand the threat this way, telling the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=64.78s)]
*  AP that this malware could be used to shut down critical machinery, sabotage industrial [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=69.02s)]
*  processes, and disable safety controllers, leading to physical destruction of machinery [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=73.86s)]
*  that could lead to the loss of human lives. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=78.86s)]
*  Cybersecurity Nicole Perlroth, veteran cybersecurity reporter, Nicole Perlroth, who we have turned [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=83.58s)]
*  to multiple times on this show to explain things to us in plain English that those of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=89.62s)]
*  us without a tech background might otherwise not get. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=94.7s)]
*  When this alert came out tonight, she put an even finer point on it that kind of puts [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=98.18s)]
*  a shiver down your spine. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=102.38s)]
*  She linked to this new joint alert from the U.S. government tonight, and she said this, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=104.9s)]
*  quote, here we go. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=109.02s)]
*  New unnamed state hackers are infecting U.S. critical infrastructure, like electrical [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=111.38s)]
*  grid operators, with custom tools capable of worst-case scenario attacks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=116.78s)]
*  There is no soft-pedaling it, she said. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=122.46s)]
*  This is very serious. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is Nicole Perlroth, cybersecurity journalist, author. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=128.78s)]
*  She's also now an advisor to CISA, to U.S. Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=132.1s)]
*  which is housed at Homeland Security. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  Ms. Perlroth, it's a pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=139.38s)]
*  Thanks for taking time. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  It's so good to see you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  And you really set this up well. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=145.34s)]
*  And you and I have had these conversations for years now about Russian potential attacks [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=146.62s)]
*  on the grid, and we've seen what they've done in Ukraine. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=151.8s)]
*  And the reason you and I know that we are in a heightened threat landscape right now [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=154.86s)]
*  is because we know they've had the access. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=159.7s)]
*  We know that they have the capabilities to shut the power down. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=162.86s)]
*  We've seen it in Ukraine. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=165.82s)]
*  What they have not had until now is the geopolitical impetus to pull the trigger. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  And so there's some really interesting questions about the timing of these attacks right now. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=173.54s)]
*  Now, I said presumably Russia when I was describing what this alert was about tonight. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=179.62s)]
*  You just mentioned Russia in summarizing it that way. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=185.7s)]
*  There isn't anything in the actual security alert from these agencies that names Russia, correct? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  Why would that be? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=197.34s)]
*  And why do you think it might be safe to assume that that is who they're talking about? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=198.34s)]
*  Well, there's a lot going on right now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=202.54000000000002s)]
*  So just in Ukraine, it appears to be the GRU. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=205.3s)]
*  This is the Russian military hackers that have taken down the Ukrainian grid twice before [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=209.06s)]
*  that have shown up here in probes, let's call them, of our power systems in the past. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  What was reported today in this Department of Energy, NSA advisory, basically said that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=220.82s)]
*  something very similar to what is happening in Ukraine is happening here, but that the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=228.73999999999998s)]
*  tools are highly customized, which make it much harder to attribute. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=233.82s)]
*  So no one is coming out and saying that this is Russia, this is the GRU. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=239.82s)]
*  We're still in very early days here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=243.78s)]
*  And it's really important to give forensic investigators the time they need to attribute [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=246.18s)]
*  these attacks. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=251.14s)]
*  But when we have seen this level of highly customized malware before on an industrial [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=252.7s)]
*  control network or critical infrastructure network, it has always generally been Russia. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=260.5s)]
*  The attack that comes to mind was on Petro-Rabai, a Saudi petrochemical facility a couple of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=267.54s)]
*  years ago where hackers using customized, bespoke code that had never been seen before [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=273.58s)]
*  used that code to do something very serious, which was neutralize the safety locks at this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=280.82s)]
*  petrochemical plant, basically the very last thing that can stave off an explosion. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=286.06s)]
*  And it took a long time for Mandiant and others to attribute that attack back to a graduate [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  research university near Moscow that was essentially an arm of the Kremlin. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=298.21999999999997s)]
*  When you see this kind of highly customized malware, you always have to stop and let these [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=303.78s)]
*  investigations take time. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=308.5s)]
*  But given the situation we are in right now with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=310.7s)]
*  sanctions, I've just been saying that the more we tighten the screws on Russia, the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=317.06s)]
*  more likely it is that at some point Putin will retaliate on the West. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=322.7s)]
*  And one very likely method of retaliation is cyber attacks on our critical infrastructure. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=329.38s)]
*  And Nicole, when this came out tonight and I saw you writing about it online, you linked [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=336.38s)]
*  to the report itself. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=340.86s)]
*  And I mean, this is a public facing document and it's, you know, that you can download [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  it from their website. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=347.65999999999997s)]
*  It's not something that they're keeping secret or they're only giving to people who are in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=348.65999999999997s)]
*  the know. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=351.9s)]
*  And you writing about it on Twitter tonight, you said, read CIS's advisory in full and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=352.9s)]
*  do everything they say now. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  Who is that advisory targeted at? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=361.14000000000004s)]
*  Who should take steps to make the kind of technical changes, very technical changes [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=363.14000000000004s)]
*  that are described in this alert in order to protect the United States from this urgent [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=368.74s)]
*  threat? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=372.54s)]
*  Well, I think the number one thing is that this is aimed towards the technical community, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=374.54s)]
*  right? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=378.54s)]
*  But it's also aimed towards senior leadership at these organizations. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=379.54s)]
*  You need to empower your chief information security officer. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=382.42s)]
*  You need to give them the money and the tools right now more than ever to log what is happening [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=386.90000000000003s)]
*  on their network, to hunt what is happening on their network, to flag any suspicious activity [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=392.74s)]
*  for CISA, because this is a very serious threat. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=398.62s)]
*  These are attacks on electrical operations. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=401.94000000000005s)]
*  They mentioned one company, Schneider Electric in there, whose devices have been compromised [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=405.38s)]
*  in this attack. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=412.74s)]
*  And those devices are used to control key aspects of the grid of manufacturing, of automation, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=413.74s)]
*  of pipelines. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=422.74s)]
*  And so if these hackers have the ability to take over those devices, you can imagine how [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=424.3s)]
*  they could be used for nefarious purposes. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=430.7s)]
*  But the key thing is really read the CISA advisory if you are an executive or if you [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=432.94s)]
*  are in IT leadership at any of these critical infrastructure organizations. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=439.14000000000004s)]
*  It's really, really important. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=443.62s)]
*  Nicole Pearlroth, cybersecurity journalist, author, now an advisor to CISA, the U.S. Cybersecurity [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=446.62s)]
*  Infrastructure Security Agency at Homeland Security. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=451.58000000000004s)]
*  Nicole, thank you as always for your clarity on this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=454.1s)]
*  Couldn't do it without you. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=457.42s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=458.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=460.22s)]
*  And it's so good to see you back. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=461.22s)]
*  So, just so far. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=462.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgsm8T-W7vo&t=463.22s)]
