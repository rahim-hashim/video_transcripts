# New Disclosures Of Evidence Expose Role Of GOP Legislators In January 6 Planning
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU)
*  It has been a tough day all around on the Trump Republican side of the ledger, though. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=0.0s)]
*  Late on Friday night, you'll recall we got that lengthy filing from the January 6th investigation [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=5.92s)]
*  disclosing all sorts of information we didn't previously have about members of Congress [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  and the administration and how they tried to throw out the election results to keep [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=15.08s)]
*  Trump in power after he lost reelection. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=18.56s)]
*  That filing from late on Friday night, 200 or 300-page-long filing, that's been bolstered [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=21.88s)]
*  by a trove of more than 2,000 text messages to and from Trump White House Chief of Staff [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=27.84s)]
*  Mark Meadows, text messages that were obtained by CNN and published by CNN in part today. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=32.64s)]
*  Taken together, that filing on Friday night from the January 6th investigators and these [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=39.64s)]
*  text messages disclosed today in the press, those two disclosures paint a sort of new [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=43.72s)]
*  and unnerving picture of how involved members of Congress and members of the administration [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=50.72s)]
*  were in trying to use not only perceived legal tools, legal maneuvers, political tactics, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=55.88s)]
*  but also the threat of mob violence to keep Trump in power. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=64.68s)]
*  I mean, first, for example, we learned from testimony to the investigation by an aide [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=68.92s)]
*  to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that Meadows was told in no uncertain terms [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=74.36s)]
*  by the White House Counsel's Office that this scheme they tried to have Republican-controlled [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=79.28s)]
*  states send fake Trump electors to be counted in the Electoral College. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=84.12s)]
*  Mark Meadows was told by the White House Counsel's Office that that scheme was illegal. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=90.0s)]
*  We then learn from testimony to the investigation that there was an attempted workaround for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  that little problem of it being illegal. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=100.92s)]
*  We've previously discussed and you've previously heard the reporting that Trump mold and attempted [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  to proverbially decapitate the Department of Justice to remove its existing leadership [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=110.16s)]
*  and instead put in place at the top of the department this man, a man named Jeff Clark. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=115.24s)]
*  You might also remember that he took the Fifth Amendment, he asserted his Fifth Amendment [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=120.72s)]
*  rights to avoid incriminating himself dozens of times during his own testimony to the January [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  6th investigation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=130.04s)]
*  Well why did Trump want to put Jeff Clark in front of the Justice Department, on the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=131.4s)]
*  top of the Justice Department? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=135.64s)]
*  Why did he want to take out the existing leadership and instead put this guy in there? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=136.84s)]
*  Well, what we have newly learned from these new disclosures is that one of the things [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=140.84s)]
*  Jeff Clark thought the Justice Department should do, what he thought they could do, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=145.04s)]
*  is that the Justice Department should issue a legal memo, a legal opinion stating that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=149.24s)]
*  actually the fake electors plan was legal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=154.72s)]
*  And Mike Pence had every opportunity and every legal right to only count electors he wanted. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=159.4s)]
*  And to send others back to the states, or indeed to consider the illegal fake electors [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  slates. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=171.92s)]
*  If the Justice Department issued a legal memorandum stating that that was all kosher, presumably [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  Trump thought that would solve the problem. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=178.84s)]
*  And that's why Trump tried to install Jeff Clark as the new Attorney General, so that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=180.67999999999998s)]
*  the Justice Department could do stuff like that to declare the coup to be legal. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=184.28s)]
*  We also learn from these new disclosures that multiple members of Congress participated [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=191.64s)]
*  in a call with the White House Chief of Staff before January 6th, in which they discussed [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=196.0s)]
*  getting the crowd from the Trump rally to go march directly on the U.S. Capitol. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=200.72s)]
*  Now, if you're not familiar with the geography of D.C., and I actually had to look at this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=206.36s)]
*  today to remind myself about this, the ellipse, which is where Trump held the rally, and the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=210.44s)]
*  Capitol building where Congress is, they're not next to each other. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=217.0s)]
*  They're two miles apart from one another. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=220.28s)]
*  So an event at the ellipse would not organically end in the crowd at the ellipse, traipsing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=223.2s)]
*  two miles to go to the Capitol building in a different part of D.C. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=229.28s)]
*  We know this in part from experience. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=235.33999999999997s)]
*  There were previous Trump rallies protesting the election results in November and in December [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  in D.C., and they were big and wild and in some cases they had violence at them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  But those did not end with people marching on the Capitol. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=248.89999999999998s)]
*  There isn't anything about a march about the election results in Washington that organically [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=252.52s)]
*  and inevitably results in the crowd surging at the U.S. Capitol building, especially if [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  it starts at the ellipse on a cold day. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=265.36s)]
*  But apparently it was no accident that the crowd on January 6th marched the two miles [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=268.40000000000003s)]
*  from the ellipse to the Capitol building. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=272.76s)]
*  It was not an unplanned ad-lib by the president that day in his speech at the ellipse when [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=276.0s)]
*  he told the crowd that they should go to the Capitol. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=280.44s)]
*  Mark Meadows claimed in his memoir that that was a real surprise when Trump ad-libbed that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=282.76s)]
*  remark because nobody had said anything about that crowd going to the Capitol. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=286.8s)]
*  Well now we know that Meadows participated in at least one meeting with multiple Republican [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=290.88s)]
*  members of Congress planning for exactly that, planning for the mob at the Trump rally to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  be steered directly at the Capitol while the vote counting was happening inside that building. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=302.8s)]
*  Also, on Friday we saw pro-Trump Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene say in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=310.8s)]
*  court in a proceeding where her eligibility to run for reelection was being challenged [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  legally. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  We saw her say in court that she could not recall ever suggesting to President Trump [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  that he might declare martial law as a way of staying in power. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=325.48s)]
*  Well today we learned in fact that she did suggest that to the White House Chief of Staff [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  Mark Meadows and she did it in writing, in a text message, and as funny and sad as it [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=333.32s)]
*  is to see her misspell martial law as martial law, like it's that story you sometimes confuse [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  with TJ Maxx or Ross Dress for Less, as ridiculous as this all is. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=343.68s)]
*  It is chilling to look at the date on that text message. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=349.56s)]
*  She wasn't suggesting that Trump declare martial law in the heat of the election results [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=354.20000000000005s)]
*  coming in and it looking like he might not. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=360.52000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't even in the lead up to the January 6th counting of the electoral votes before [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=363.58s)]
*  we knew there was going to be a physical attack on the Congress, right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=369.09999999999997s)]
*  We now know Republican members of Congress were scheming with the White House directly [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  about directing the mob to leave the rally site on January 6th and march on Congress [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=377.38s)]
*  while the vote count was underway. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=381.46s)]
*  She wasn't considering and advising the White House that the President should declare [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=382.97999999999996s)]
*  martial law in the heat of that craziness. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=386.53999999999996s)]
*  No, look at the date. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=389.58s)]
*  She sent her misspelled martial law suggestion January 17th. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=392.32s)]
*  That's a week and a half after the January 6th attack. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=396.96s)]
*  After the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol to try to keep Trump in power, a week and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=402.92s)]
*  a half later, she was advising the White House that maybe martial law was going to be what [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  it took. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=411.08s)]
*  She was suggesting that three days before the inauguration of President Biden and Vice [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=412.08s)]
*  President Harris, suggesting martial law is the way that Trump should save the republic [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=416.48s)]
*  and stay in power. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  It's also it makes it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  Not hard to understand, because I think I understand it, but it makes it a remarkable [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=432.56s)]
*  thing that the January 6th investigation apparently isn't going to be able to take any [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=436.32s)]
*  testimony from serving Republican members of Congress in their investigation. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  We've known that that was unlikely when Republican members of Congress started saying [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=445.68s)]
*  no to requests to testify voluntarily. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=450.0s)]
*  But now that we know how many of them were up to their necks in this thing, including [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=452.56s)]
*  being involved in the discussions about getting the mob physically to the Capitol building, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=456.76s)]
*  it is somewhat amazing that none of them are going to find themselves under oath answering [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=461.72s)]
*  questions about what they did. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssWNBNn7DuU&t=466.04s)]
