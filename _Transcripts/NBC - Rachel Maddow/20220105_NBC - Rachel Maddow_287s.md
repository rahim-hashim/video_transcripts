# Chuck Schumer: January 6 Was Not A One-Off, Trump Urged People To Come
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q)
*  Senate Majority Leader Senator Chuck Schumer joins us live now. Senator Schumer, it's a real pleasure to have you with us tonight. Thank you so much. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Good evening, Rachel. Good to be back on. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=6.76s)]
*  Let me ask you, we have a lot to talk about, but let me ask you first about those remarks today from Attorney General Garland. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=9.68s)]
*  I wanted to just get your response to what he said about the investigation into the crimes that culminated on January 6th at the Capitol [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=15.56s)]
*  and what he said about Congress's need to act on voting rights. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=23.56s)]
*  Well, first, in terms of the invasion of the Capitol, that was one of the darkest moments in American history. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=27.959999999999997s)]
*  It was an attempt to actually change the government illegitimately, which we don't see in a democracy, using violence. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=34.8s)]
*  And I just hope they throw the book at these people. I don't know the specific cases. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=42.68s)]
*  I don't know how the exact law applies to each case. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  But when I read sometimes that they've gotten probation or a short period of time in jail, it bothers me a great deal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=51.08s)]
*  So I believe the Justice Department is ramping it up and they're looking at the perpetrators who led the charges. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=59.36s)]
*  And I hope they will do everything they can to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=66.16s)]
*  About the second question, he's exactly right. We can prosecute these people, but make no mistake about it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=71.16s)]
*  January 6th was not a one off. It stemmed from the big lie perpetrated by Donald Trump. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=77.36s)]
*  This invasion of the Capitol didn't just come sui generis. He urged people to come. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=84.32s)]
*  He urged people to march on the Capitol. Many of them who went into the Capitol believed he was urging violence. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=89.36s)]
*  But the same big lie that created January 6th by Donald Trump is also importuning [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=95.16s)]
*  legislatures, Republican legislatures throughout the country to dramatically curb the right to vote and not just everybody's right to vote, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=103.68s)]
*  but specifically people who tend to vote Democratic, whether it be people of color or poor people or people who live in big cities or young people, people on campuses. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  So this is a this is a dagger aimed at the heart of our democracy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=122.64000000000001s)]
*  And the two January 6th and what's going on in the legislatures are directly related and all stem from Donald Trump's big lie. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=127.0s)]
*  The only way to curb this second perpetuation of the big lie is for Congress to act. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=135.6s)]
*  He's absolutely right. Because of that connection between the pretext for the January 6th attack and the pretext for these voting rights restrictions that you just described, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=142.36s)]
*  that the attorney general described today, I wonder what you make of the fact that a number of Republican senators voted to impeach Donald Trump for what happened on January 6th, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=155.08s)]
*  voted to impeach him for his role in inciting that attack on the Capitol and that effort to overthrow the election. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=165.68s)]
*  And yet even those senators will not vote to protect voting rights against attacks that are undergirded by the same claims. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  If these things are, in fact, connected, why are Republicans who recognize one side of that not recognizing the other? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=179.84s)]
*  Well, we're in a different Republican Party than we used to be. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=186.56s)]
*  You know, voting rights, Rachel, used to be very bipartisan. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=189.12s)]
*  Ronald Reagan supported extension of the Voting Rights Act. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=193.12s)]
*  George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush supported it when it used to come up in the Congress. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  It got large margins. What's happened is this is a new Republican Party. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=200.68s)]
*  And this is a fact we're impressing on all of our colleagues, all 50 of our colleagues. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=204.92s)]
*  It's a different Republican Party run by Donald Trump and the fidelity to elections, the fidelity to democracy is no longer there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=209.44s)]
*  Donald Trump the other day endorsed Orban. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=218.24s)]
*  This man's a dictator who is undoing whatever democracy Hungary had. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  And I believe his beliefs are similar. It's his own ego. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=225.72s)]
*  He wants to just dominate. And he doesn't care about our democracy, our history, about the rights of people to vote. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=229.28s)]
*  And by the way, so that is spread. All the Republicans, almost every single one of them, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  even those seven who bravely voted to impeach him, are no longer bucking Donald Trump. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=242.72s)]
*  They've almost all given up. The ones the ones who some of them have quit. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=247.64s)]
*  I think five Republicans aren't running again. And my guess is more than my guess. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=252.12s)]
*  My understanding is a good number of them quit because they didn't want to serve under Donald Trump. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=256.32s)]
*  But no one, no one on that side of the aisle seems to be bucking him on this issue. And it's a tragedy. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=260.76s)]
*  you [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfUDDGsB94Q&t=286.28s)]
