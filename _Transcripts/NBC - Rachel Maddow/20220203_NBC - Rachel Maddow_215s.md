# DeSantis Treats Florida Nazi Incidents As Political Game; Condemns Democrats Instead
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw)
*  How's things going in Florida these days? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=0.0s)]
*  In addition to this rash of Nazi incidents, in addition to the Nazi incidents themselves, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=4.44s)]
*  it's kind of a follow-on scandal that's now simmering in Florida involving Florida's Republican [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=10.92s)]
*  governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=16.0s)]
*  When the Nazi group showed up in central Florida on Saturday, right, screaming anti-Semitic [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=18.66s)]
*  abuse at people and beating up at least one Jewish passerby, and then the Nazis showed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=22.72s)]
*  up the following day and there's overpasses as well. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=28.96s)]
*  This was upsetting, right, in central Florida. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  And local and state leaders, Democrat and Republican, they all rushed to condemn the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=33.68s)]
*  Nazis one by one. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=37.88s)]
*  The local mayor, the sheriff, members of Congress, Florida's Republican U.S. Senator Rick Scott, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=38.88s)]
*  they all volunteered themselves. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=43.72s)]
*  They all came forward and condemned the events in no uncertain terms. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=45.88s)]
*  But from the governor, it's been a little weird. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=49.72s)]
*  The only initial response from Florida's Republican governor Ron DeSantis was this tweet from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=51.92s)]
*  his press secretary saying, quote, Do we even know if they are Nazis? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=56.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they volunteered that they are. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  And also the swastika banners help with that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=66.0s)]
*  She's since deleted that tweet. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=68.72s)]
*  You'll be happy to know that after that wobbly start to this little crisis, Governor DeSantis [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=71.72s)]
*  did finally get around to addressing the Nazis in Orlando issue. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=76.16s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=81.64s)]
*  Let's respond to the Nazi demonstration in Orlando over the weekend. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=82.64s)]
*  Why do you feel hate groups would go to the streets? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=87.64s)]
*  So what I'm going to say is these people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=91.92s)]
*  I'm just going to stop that there for a second and say what I'm going to say is these people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=96.44s)]
*  You can sort of guess where he's going, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=101.6s)]
*  What I'm going to say is these people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=104.8s)]
*  What do you think he's going to say next, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=107.52s)]
*  What I'm going to say is these people, these neo-Nazi hate groups, they have no place in [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=109.28s)]
*  our society, no place in Florida. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=113.24s)]
*  I condemn them in the strongest terms. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=114.8s)]
*  You figure that's what he's going to say, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=116.76s)]
*  You figure that is where Florida's governor is going with that statement. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=118.8s)]
*  Because I mean, that is the easiest, most straightforward question an American politician [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=122.44s)]
*  can get, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=126.76s)]
*  Please respond to the Nazis. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=127.84s)]
*  That's like a long, slow softball right over the play. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=130.36s)]
*  Are you ready? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=133.56s)]
*  There's only one right answer to that and you shouldn't have to memorize it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=134.56s)]
*  It's an easy one. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=137.4s)]
*  Please respond to the Nazis. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=138.52s)]
*  That's what Ron DeSantis was asked and he starts off. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=143.24s)]
*  So what I'm going to say to these people, what do you think he says next? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=144.84s)]
*  Here's where we went with it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=150.44s)]
*  So what I'm going to say is these people, these Democrats who are trying to use this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  as some type of political issue to try to smear me as if I had something to do with [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=158.56s)]
*  it, we're not playing their game. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=163.72s)]
*  We're not going to play their game of condemning Nazis because that's a Democrat game that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=167.48s)]
*  you don't want to get dragged into to muddy yourself. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=174.6s)]
*  I am not kidding when I tell you that Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, his answer continued [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=179.07999999999998s)]
*  for another two and a half minutes in which he talked about Joe Biden and inflation and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=183.38s)]
*  immigration and crime. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=188.82s)]
*  He even talked about Airbnb, but he never actually got around to condemning the Nazis. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qphg5DhDdyw&t=190.2s)]
