# Ohio neo-Nazi arrested; admits trying to firebomb church over drag story event
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M)
*  I want to update you on an unsettling story we covered a few weeks ago here on the show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=0.0s)]
*  You might remember some of this footage that we showed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  We heard from a lot of you about it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  It's footage from a neo-Nazi rally targeting trans people and drag performance in Ohio. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=8.94s)]
*  And I'm not using the phrase neo-Nazi here as some sort of generic epithet. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=15.72s)]
*  I mean, that is specifically what we are dealing with here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=19.2s)]
*  So we showed you this video on the show a few weeks ago. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=23.0s)]
*  Protesters including dozens of neo-Nazis, some of them conspicuously armed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=39.0s)]
*  They're carrying swastika flags. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=44.92s)]
*  They're shouting sig heil. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=46.72s)]
*  They were screaming at a drag queen story hour, a family-friendly event that was being [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=49.12s)]
*  held in Wadsworth, Ohio. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=52.94s)]
*  Well now, here's an update. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=56.32s)]
*  This photo is from a newly released federal criminal complaint. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=58.94s)]
*  This complaint identifies a 20-year-old man you see at the center of this image as a member [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=62.54s)]
*  of the Ohio chapter of White Lives Matter. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=67.28s)]
*  This photo shows him at that anti-trans protest that we covered last month. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=72.02s)]
*  This man was arrested and charged in federal court for allegedly trying to fire bomb an [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=78.0s)]
*  Ohio church. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  He is currently in federal custody. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=84.72s)]
*  According to the FBI and the Justice Department, the man drove to a church more than an hour [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  from his home. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=91.24s)]
*  He brought with him these Molotov cocktails and a spray bottle filled with gasoline. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=92.64s)]
*  He then fire bombed the church. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  The church was marked with scorch marks. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  The FBI says they were able to link him to the attack by tracing the location of his [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=102.0s)]
*  cell phone. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=105.72s)]
*  According to the criminal complaint in his case, when FBI agents arrived at his home, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=107.0s)]
*  he admitted to building the Molotov cocktails and to throwing them at the church. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=111.52s)]
*  They said he told them the reason he did it was to stop a drag show event that was scheduled [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=116.44s)]
*  for the following week at the church. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=121.64s)]
*  He told them his only regret was that the Molotov cocktails didn't cause more damage. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=124.4s)]
*  There was nobody inside the church at the time that he attacked it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=130.24s)]
*  Nobody was hurt, but you can see there was some damage. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=134.32s)]
*  The church says they would like to see this young man prosecuted to send a message to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=136.84s)]
*  other like-minded people, but the church also says they forgive him for what he did. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=140.44s)]
*  In the end, the church was able to hold that drag story event that they had planned for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=147.6s)]
*  this past weekend as originally planned. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=153.52s)]
*  There was a protest about 15 minutes down the road at a related drag event in a neighboring [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=156.8s)]
*  town. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=161.88s)]
*  This one was targeted by a white nationalist group called the Patriot Front. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=162.92s)]
*  That's them across the street there near the gazebo. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=168.11999999999998s)]
*  You can see the ultra-right, the violent ultra-right, including the neo-Nazi movement in this country, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  is for whatever reason extremely energized right now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  We talk a lot about how the very far right, how extremists are connected to electoral [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=182.92s)]
*  politics and the like. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=188.56s)]
*  But these federal charges for trying to firebomb a church over a drag story hour really puts [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=190.56s)]
*  an exclamation point on the rise of right-wing extremism and right-wing violence just on [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=195.16s)]
*  its own terms, regardless of what it's connected to. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=200.32s)]
*  Again, he's been charged in federal court. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=203.16s)]
*  He's in custody right now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=205.84s)]
*  We'll know more later this week when he has his first day in court. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjqPwj6Gw0M&t=207.24s)]
