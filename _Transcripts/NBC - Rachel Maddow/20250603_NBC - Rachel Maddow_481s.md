Video Description: Rachel Maddow talks with Nicolle Wallace, whose new podcast, "The Best People," debuts today, about Ukraine's surprise drone attack on Russia and how Donald Trump, in a very short time, has made the U.S. blind to what other countries are up to, and excluded by our own traditional allies while the rest of the world moves ahead.

# Ukraine burns Putin, but also schools Trump with surprise drone attack
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs)
*  Joining us now is Nicole Wallace. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=0.0s)]
*  Before becoming my beloved colleague here at MSNBC, Nicole, of course, was White House [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=2.4s)]
*  Communications Director. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=5.96s)]
*  She knows how this kind of crisis should be handled, at least from a communications perspective. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=7.5s)]
*  She also has a brand new podcast. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=12.34s)]
*  It's called The Best People, where Nicole interviews some of the top minds and thinkers [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=13.8s)]
*  in the country about how to handle this moment we're living through right now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=17.92s)]
*  She also talked to me on the podcast for some reason. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=21.18s)]
*  I'm not sure how I snuck in. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=23.2s)]
*  The podcast just launched today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=24.6s)]
*  It's already number one on Apple podcasts. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=27.18s)]
*  Nicole, my friend, congratulations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=29.38s)]
*  And thanks for being here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  I know this is a really busy day for you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=32.74s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=34.38s)]
*  I've never used Mike's shot. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=36.9s)]
*  This is where my husband usually sits in. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=38.9s)]
*  So I'm sitting in his chair. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=41.46s)]
*  So thank you for having me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=43.7s)]
*  I will say Mike sort of won most improved award. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  Remember when he first started doing remote shots during COVID? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=49.1s)]
*  It always looked like he was being held hostage. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=51.86s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=54.66s)]
*  He really managed the like, I'm here against my will thing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=55.81999999999999s)]
*  And gradually, I think you kind of dressed him up and gave him some stuff that made it [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=58.62s)]
*  look like he didn't need rescuing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=61.81999999999999s)]
*  You know, I stayed out of it completely. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=64.46s)]
*  So he deserves all of the credit. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  Very good. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=68.25999999999999s)]
*  Nicole, I wanted to talk to you about this Ukraine Jones story, just because I mean, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=69.25999999999999s)]
*  I feel like you're one of my friends who understands how my brain works on this sort of thing. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=75.17999999999999s)]
*  I think your brain works in sort of the same way. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=80.06s)]
*  It is an incredible war story about Ukraine's capability and their resilience and their [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=82.46s)]
*  creativity and the way they have just done this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=89.02s)]
*  You know, like David versus Goliath. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=92.02s)]
*  They've accomplished things that nobody thought they could. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=96.3s)]
*  But it also does have international strategic implications for every country in the world [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=98.82s)]
*  that's kind of in Russia's position in terms of thinking about its own defenses, thinking [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=104.38s)]
*  about its own nuclear deterrence. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=108.9s)]
*  I wondered what your reaction was when you learned about that story this weekend. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=110.94000000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, the idea that we're flying blind is so terrifying, but we only think of it [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=115.34s)]
*  in the context of flying blind vis-a-vis our adversaries. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=120.94000000000001s)]
*  And it's difficult in this context to even make clear which side is our adversary, right? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  But I think we had a similar reaction to Trump's ambush of Zelensky in the Oval Office. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=130.58s)]
*  But one of the things that has taken a minute to reveal itself is just how blind we would be [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=136.18s)]
*  to how Ukraine would respond and how Ukraine would proceed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=141.78s)]
*  And I think there are a lot of things that we have to reevaluate and change the conventional wisdom. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  The idea that Ukraine is the underdog is still correct. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=151.14s)]
*  But the idea that Ukraine will not score massive victories in this war and do massive damage to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  Russia that will also have implications to our national security was probably an erroneous assumption. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=158.9s)]
*  The idea that Trump aligned us with Russia is something that the world is still sifting through. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=165.38s)]
*  But the fact is we are flying blind, and that is terrifying vis-a-vis Ukraine and Russia. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=171.06s)]
*  It's terrifying vis-a-vis China and the tariffs. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=178.34s)]
*  It's obvious that we have no idea what's happening inside China and their economy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  And we have no idea what's happening inside Ukraine and Russia and the war there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=186.18s)]
*  And that is probably the larger, scarier national security piece of what Trump has accomplished in 130 days. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=190.58s)]
*  Yeah. And you know, it's interesting. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=199.22000000000003s)]
*  I feel like for me, this was a great humbling reminder that as much as we focus on what's going [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=201.06s)]
*  wrong in our own government and what's going wrong in our own country because of this [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=207.46s)]
*  fundamentally incompetent and malicious government that we've got, the rest of the world is continuing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  not just to react, but to innovate and adjust and to move on without us. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=218.9s)]
*  And to have somebody in a country as powerful as ours realign us so that we're an ally of Russia [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=224.18s)]
*  and the rest of the free world now still allied with Ukraine gets to adapt to that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=233.22s)]
*  and gets to adjust to that and gets to build their own strength and capability [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=240.42000000000002s)]
*  with essentially seeing us as an adversary rather than an ally, let alone a protector. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=244.18s)]
*  I just feel like, God, the world is so unpredictable now with us absenting ourselves from our traditional [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=248.5s)]
*  leadership role. And it makes me what I think I was thinking about this in your show, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=255.22s)]
*  because you're so good at finding the smart people, the best people, the people who have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=260.26s)]
*  the most expertise to bring to bear in any given subject. Do you feel like the sort of expert [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=264.42s)]
*  universe of American know-how on national security issues is off the table forever because of the way [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=270.02s)]
*  our government's behaving? Or do you think in future the United States can ever sort of regain [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=278.97999999999996s)]
*  any of our trusted position on issues like this? Well, look, I heard from Sue Gordon tonight. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=283.94s)]
*  I mean, the national security DNA is so wired to protect America, right? I mean, they are so [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=289.7s)]
*  hardwired to do everything in their power and to apply everything they know and all the relationships [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=296.74s)]
*  they have across our alliances in service of protecting this country. And so there's no way [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=303.3s)]
*  that they wouldn't return to those roles and those traditional functions. But what's so [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  bat-bleep crazy is that we even have to ask those questions. And I was watching [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=318.18s)]
*  you're open, and it rightfully focuses on the technology. I think when we look at it, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=323.14s)]
*  and I watched your A-block with tears streaming down my face, it's more about what will we lose [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  in the near term and what will we lose in terms of our standing in the world when you see a [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  government so distant from its own people? I mean, as you said on the immigration story, as is true [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  on the tariff story, which I spent a lot of time on today, Trump is moving the country away from [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=344.18s)]
*  what the people want it to be. And when you look at what Ukraine did, it didn't just score a massive [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=349.54s)]
*  military victory. It displayed technological competence that is the envy of the world this [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  morning. So it's not just that we're on the wrong side. It's not just that we're flying blind. It's [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=360.66s)]
*  that we may have missed out on an unbelievable technological breakthrough that we, heaven forbid, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=365.38s)]
*  might need someday. Yes, that's exactly right. Nicole, I just have to ask you, congratulations [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=371.3s)]
*  on being number one podcast, not just in the country, number one podcast in the world with [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=377.54s)]
*  your new podcast. Is it fun? Have you been enjoying it? I mean, it's tons more work on top of, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=382.18s)]
*  you know, you're doing two hours a day already. Have you been enjoying doing it? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=387.54s)]
*  Well, you podcast people make it look so easy, and the whole I can do it in my head is a total [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=392.02000000000004s)]
*  head fake. I mean, it is not easy because you can wear your sweatpants. But what I love, and I think [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=398.90000000000003s)]
*  you made this so clear and you were so generous with me, but there is a different conversation [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=405.94s)]
*  that you have when you're wearing your headphones and your sweatpants. There is a real intimacy to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=413.14s)]
*  it. And I loved our conversation. I was so happy that we got to put it up today. And it's really, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=417.7s)]
*  I have a lot to learn. I can't stand listening just to my voice. So I want to go to podcast [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=423.94s)]
*  school now and learn how to get better at it. But it's really fun. I'm sure we can rig something up [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=428.18s)]
*  so that the voice you hear in your ears that is technically what you're saying is somebody else's [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=434.58s)]
*  voice. Do you like better? I'm sure that that can be rigged up. We can work on that for you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=439.3s)]
*  Nicole Wallace, congratulations again on The Best People. Again, Nicole's new podcast is called The [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=445.53999999999996s)]
*  Best People. It's number one, not just in the country, but in the whole world right now on [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=451.06s)]
*  Apple podcasts. It's up right now. It's fantastic. Nicole, you're amazing. Thank you so much, my friend. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=454.82s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=459.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJZls5KIZs&t=464.58s)]
