# January 6 Probe Tips Its Hand With Eye-Popping Details In Letter To Ivanka Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4)
*  And the January 6 investigation today showed a whole bunch of its work in a kind of shocking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=0.0s)]
*  letter to Ivanka Trump, the adult daughter of former President Trump. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=7.5s)]
*  This has been a remarkable few days for the Trump family. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  I mean, just in the past 48 hours, right, we've had the news reported by CNN that Eric [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=15.5s)]
*  Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who's the fiancée of Donald Trump Jr., they reportedly both [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=19.98s)]
*  had their phone records subpoenaed and obtained by the January 6 investigation. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=25.64s)]
*  Also, Don Jr. and Ivanka Trump, as well as their father, the former president, they were [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=30.84s)]
*  all the subject of a long public-facing court filing from the New York attorney general, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  effectively accusing them all of personal involvement in a very detailed, sort of lurid [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=41.16s)]
*  list of alleged bank fraud, tax fraud and insurance fraud schemes at the Trump family [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  real estate business. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=51.86s)]
*  I think it must have been unsettling for those members of the Trump family that the allegations [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=54.32s)]
*  were laid out sort of in particular to each one of them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=58.64s)]
*  The filings from the New York attorney general this week, for example, stated this about [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=62.6s)]
*  Ivanka Trump, quote, until January 2017, Ms. Ivanka Trump was a primary contact for the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=66.04s)]
*  Trump organization's largest lender, Deutsche Bank. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=71.84s)]
*  In connection with this work, Ms. Trump caused misleading financial statements to be submitted [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=74.8s)]
*  to Deutsche Bank and to the federal government. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=79.9s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=83.6s)]
*  When an attorney general says that about you specifically and personally, while asking [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  a judge to enforce the subpoena for your testimony, after your brother, the blonde one, just had [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  to plead the fifth over 500 times in his recent deposition in that case. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=96.16s)]
*  And that's not good. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=100.52s)]
*  But now, I mean, all in the same 48-hour period, now we've got this bombshell letter to Ivanka [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=102.8s)]
*  Trump from the January 6 investigation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=107.16s)]
*  And in this January 6 investigation letter to her, we do not have harsh allegations against [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=109.7s)]
*  her personally, the way we do, for example, from the New York attorney general. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=115.5s)]
*  But we do have a surprising number of sort of eye-popping revelations about what the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=119.3s)]
*  committee has found out thus far, what the committee knows. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=125.26s)]
*  And there are lots of questions for Ms. Trump to come in and talk about what she knows, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=129.2s)]
*  given how much she apparently features in other people's testimony. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=132.9s)]
*  There's so much going on in this today. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=137.78s)]
*  We're going to get expert help understanding the importance of some of these revelations [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=139.7s)]
*  in just a moment. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=142.98s)]
*  But let me just give you a couple of them to start. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=143.98s)]
*  This is from the letter. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=146.62s)]
*  As January 6 approached, President Trump attempted on multiple occasions to persuade Vice President [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=147.62s)]
*  Pence to participate in his plan to not count the legitimate electors for the Electoral [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=153.38s)]
*  College vote. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=158.34s)]
*  One of the president's discussions with Vice President Pence occurred on the phone on the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  morning of January 6. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=163.14s)]
*  You, meaning you, Ivanka Trump, you were present in the Oval Office and observed at least one [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  side of that telephone conversation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=169.85999999999999s)]
*  General Keith Kellogg was also present in the Oval Office during that call, and he has [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=172.05999999999997s)]
*  testified to the January 6 investigation about that discussion as follows. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=175.85999999999999s)]
*  Question, then there's this transcript from Keith Kellogg's testimony. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  Question, it's been reported that the president said to the vice president, you don't have [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=184.89999999999998s)]
*  the courage to make a hard decision. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=188.89999999999998s)]
*  And maybe not those exact words, but something like that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=190.77999999999997s)]
*  Do you remember anything like that? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=192.86s)]
*  Answer from Keith Kellogg. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=194.74s)]
*  Words, and I don't remember exactly either, but something like that, yeah. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=195.74s)]
*  Being like, you're not tough enough to make the call. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=200.18s)]
*  Question, another report of this phone call is that Trump said, Mike, it's not right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=202.62s)]
*  You can do this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm counting on you to do it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  If you don't do it, I picked the wrong man four years ago. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  You're going to wimp out. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  Do you remember anything like that? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=213.18s)]
*  Answer from Keith Kellogg. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=215.18s)]
*  Words like that, yes. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=217.06s)]
*  I can't exactly. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=218.78000000000003s)]
*  I can't. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=219.78000000000003s)]
*  It's tough. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=220.78000000000003s)]
*  General Kellogg also testified regarding your remarks, meaning Ivanka Trump's remarks, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=221.78s)]
*  at the close of the call. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=228.5s)]
*  Quote, Ivanka Trump turned to me and said, Mike Pence is a good man. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=229.82s)]
*  And I said, yes, he is. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=234.34s)]
*  The letter then continues. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=236.26s)]
*  The select committee wishes to discuss the part of the conversation you observed between [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=238.34s)]
*  President Trump and Vice President Pence on the morning of January 6th. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=241.88s)]
*  Similarly, the committee would like to discuss any other conversations you may have witnessed [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=245.54s)]
*  or participated in regarding the president's plan to obstruct or impede the counting of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=248.92s)]
*  electoral votes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=254.16s)]
*  The committee has information suggesting that President Trump's White House counsel may [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  have concluded that the actions President Trump directed Vice President Pence to take [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=259.8s)]
*  would violate the Constitution or would otherwise be illegal. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  Did you discuss those issues with any member of the White House counsel's office? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=268.56s)]
*  To your knowledge, were any such legal conclusions shared with President Trump? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=271.97999999999996s)]
*  Similarly, in the, I mean, sorry. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=276.52s)]
*  Similarly, in the days before January 6th, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, which [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  is the furthest right, most pro-Trump caucus within the House Republican, within among [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=286.08s)]
*  Republican members of the House of Representatives. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=291.28s)]
*  In the days before January 6th, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, with knowledge of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  the president's planning for that day, sent a message to the White House chief of staff [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  with this explicit warning, quote, If POTUS allows this to occur, we're driving a stake [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=302.64s)]
*  in the heart of the federal republic. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=309.08s)]
*  Did you discuss that or similar concerns with the White House chief of staff or with the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=311.84s)]
*  vice president or his staff? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=315.71999999999997s)]
*  The committee, after all of that, goes on to assert that Trump actually did intend, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=319.38s)]
*  he did want to go down to the Capitol himself after he made his speech riling up the crowd. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=324.76s)]
*  He apparently wanted to lead the mob down to the U.S. Capitol personally. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=331.94s)]
*  They said they want to ask Ivanka about that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=336.42s)]
*  The committee also asserts that they have found no evidence that Trump ever called for [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=339.74s)]
*  the National Guard to be deployed or for any other law enforcement effort be made to protect [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=343.06s)]
*  the Capitol over the entire scope of the day on January 6th. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=347.18s)]
*  It just goes on and on. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=351.9s)]
*  I mean, there's all revelations about what the committee has found. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=353.26s)]
*  I should also point out that it then ends pointedly with a reminder to Ms. Trump that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=357.94s)]
*  all White House officials need to have their communications preserved and handed over to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=363.34s)]
*  the National Archives, with the clear implication that perhaps her communications have not been [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=367.86s)]
*  adequately archived, and she needs to do that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nABc-2SuBq4&t=373.06s)]
