# 'What patriotism and selfless service looks like': Maddow reacts to Biden's address to the nation
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M)
*  We are now joined by our dear friend and colleague Rachel Nadeau by phone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=0.0s)]
*  Rachel, he said this, quote, I need to unite my party. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=3.92s)]
*  The best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=6.92s)]
*  You know, in recent weeks, it's become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=10.92s)]
*  critical endeavor. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=15.08s)]
*  I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  all merit a second term. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=20.92s)]
*  But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=22.68s)]
*  That includes personal ambition. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=26.72s)]
*  So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=28.92s)]
*  That is the best way to unite our nation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=33.78s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, first of all, I'm sorry that I'm not there with all of you in person. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  I am homesick and trying hard not to get anybody else sick. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=42.96s)]
*  But wow, I mean, I think it should also just be said, like, this is one of those speeches [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=47.64s)]
*  that is going to go down in history, not just as a great Joe Biden speech, but as a great [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=53.02s)]
*  moment in the American presidency. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=57.22s)]
*  I mean, you know, that quote that you just described, of course, that nothing should [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=60.38s)]
*  stand in the way of saving our democracy, including personal ambition, but also, you [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=65.98s)]
*  know, the way he started talking about, you know, honesty, decency, respect, does character [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=71.5s)]
*  in public life still matter? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=78.62s)]
*  It's this is this is a timeless speech about a very specific moment, both where he came [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=82.14s)]
*  to the presidency from talking about what, frankly, the former president left him, the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=88.38s)]
*  worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=93.7s)]
*  attack on our democracy since the Civil War, all simultaneously. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=98.5s)]
*  That's what he walked into. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=102.58s)]
*  But now his feeling that his personal ambition and belief that he is his record does warrant [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=104.34s)]
*  a second term and he wants it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=110.82s)]
*  And you hear that in his ambition, even talking about what he plans to do these next six months, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=112.13999999999999s)]
*  that that itself is can't be bigger than the needs of the nation and the needs of the nation [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=117.22s)]
*  to stay with this form of government, what he called one of the greatest ideas in the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=123.22s)]
*  history of the world. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=127.06s)]
*  It's an elegant speech at an emotional and very moving moment for this president. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=128.22s)]
*  And I think sort of timelessly for the presidency, this this is sort of a tent pole in terms [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=135.5s)]
*  of what patriotism and selfless service looks like. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=141.26s)]
*  And I'm sure this couldn't have been easy for him, but it was it was beautifully done. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=145.18s)]
*  And these are one of those lines in the chapter about the speech in the book about this president. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=148.94s)]
*  I think this is one of the lines that will be pulled out, Rachel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=155.26s)]
*  Kings and dictators do not rule. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=159.7s)]
*  The people do. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=161.34s)]
*  The great thing about America is here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=162.34s)]
*  Kings and dictators do not rule. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=164.5s)]
*  People do. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=166.62s)]
*  History is in your hands. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=167.62s)]
*  The power is in your hands. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=168.62s)]
*  The idea of America lies in your hands. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=170.46s)]
*  You just have to keep faith, keep the faith and remember who we are. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=173.62s)]
*  We're the United States of America and there is simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=177.94s)]
*  We do it together. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=183.38s)]
*  So let's act together, preserve our democracy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=184.74s)]
*  The president there, Rachel, sort of speaking right to one of the tools, as you know, better [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=187.94s)]
*  than anyone of the autocrat to make people feel that they have no agency, to make people [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=193.14s)]
*  feel despair, that an end to democracy or an end to our norms is inevitable. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=198.06s)]
*  The president there, I think, throwing down throwing down a marker for the American people, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=203.57999999999998s)]
*  for the rest of us to to, you know, keep the republic. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=213.74s)]
*  And you know, I think, Nicole, what he's also done here is he's he's positing a view of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=215.18s)]
*  the presidency, which is just directly opposite to the idea of authoritarianism, which is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=222.62s)]
*  opposite to the idea of autocracy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  How does he start the speech? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=230.82s)]
*  He talks about being in the Oval Office talking about the portraits of presidents past who [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=232.02s)]
*  surround him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  And he says, I revere this office, but I love this country more. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  I revere this office, but I love this country more. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=245.14000000000001s)]
*  What the autocrat loves is the office. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=247.82s)]
*  And then the country must be supplicant to the ruler. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=250.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  The most important thing about a country is who's in charge and everything else has to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  fall in line behind that ruler or they're disloyal and they need to be seen as an enemy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=258.92s)]
*  and cast out. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=262.8s)]
*  Instead, Biden is saying here the role of the presidency is to serve this idea of the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  nation. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=269.44s)]
*  The role of a president is to make sure the country is protected, not for the country [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=270.44s)]
*  to serve the president. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=275.8s)]
*  And that is, I mean, it's a it's an I think it's true. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=278.48s)]
*  I think it's the basic idea of the presidency. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=283.32s)]
*  It's why the president and the whole executive branch has co equal branches in our government [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  that are designed to keep the country on track if any one of those branches goes off the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=291.46000000000004s)]
*  rails. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=295.04s)]
*  But it's also just the opposite idea to what his opponent is offering in this election. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=296.42s)]
*  I mean, J.D. Vance, the running mate of Donald Trump, said in his acceptance speech that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=303.48s)]
*  America is not an idea. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=309.0s)]
*  No, it is. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  The idea of it is that we are a democracy, we're of, by and for the people and that the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=312.44s)]
*  president is not a king and that we're all bound by the same rule of law. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=316.6s)]
*  And there's no I alone can fix it in the vision of the United States that Joe Biden talked [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=321.68s)]
*  about tonight and that he's ascribing to the founders. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=327.08s)]
*  And I think most Americans I think most Americans would agree with him there. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=329.56s)]
*  Rachel, we know you're sick. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=336.48s)]
*  We want to let you get back to your chicken soup. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=337.64s)]
*  But we're so happy to have you with us. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=339.68s)]
*  Let me just read you one more piece that gets at what I think you talk about so often. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=341.32s)]
*  And that is this moment, this everything that makes it different. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=345.36s)]
*  The president saying this, I've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=349.72s)]
*  point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine our [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  fate, the fate of the nation and the world for decades to come. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=357.36s)]
*  America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=361.72s)]
*  hate, between unity and division. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=365.6s)]
*  We have to decide. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  Do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=369.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=377.04s)]
*  And then he finished that by saying, does character in public life still matter? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=379.48s)]
*  I mean, he knows exactly where we are. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=383.44s)]
*  His voice may be faltering. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=386.04s)]
*  His delivery may not be as strong as we remember it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=388.68s)]
*  At the beginning of this term, the presidency takes a toll and he's the oldest man to ever [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=392.24s)]
*  have the job. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=396.52s)]
*  And he had this job at the time of incredible challenges. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=397.52s)]
*  But his vision is clear. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=403.2s)]
*  And when he talks about the choice that we've got, I mean, there really is, there really [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=405.36s)]
*  is without hyperbole, a choice here, not just between candidates, but between the American [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=411.76s)]
*  system of government or something new. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=417.2s)]
*  And that's what he's talking about. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think that if he were up against a Mitt Romney style Republican or even a Marco Rubio [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=422.44s)]
*  style Republican, Joe Biden would not have left office because I think that he would [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=427.56s)]
*  think, you know what? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=434.12s)]
*  Yeah, there might be a risk because I'm old, but I know that I've got the record to do [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=435.12s)]
*  this and I know that I've got a record to run on and I want to finish the job and I'm [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=439.0s)]
*  going to push through my critics and do it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=443.6s)]
*  But what he's saying here is that the contest that we're in is bigger than any one president, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=445.24s)]
*  is bigger than any moment in the personal history of Joe Biden. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=451.12s)]
*  It's bigger than my biggest personal ambitions. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=456.6s)]
*  The moment that we're in is about whether or not we continue as a republic. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=459.72s)]
*  And it's not a hyperbolic thing to say given what he's up against and given the way his [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=464.44s)]
*  opponent tried to stay in office after he was voted out the last time. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=470.14s)]
*  And it's just I mean, we knew this was a very selfless thing that he did when he did it on [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=474.98s)]
*  Sunday with this paper statement. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=480.94s)]
*  But I think this speech tonight goes down in the annals of American history as a clarion, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  a clarion moment. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9fySRCWc7M&t=489.86s)]
