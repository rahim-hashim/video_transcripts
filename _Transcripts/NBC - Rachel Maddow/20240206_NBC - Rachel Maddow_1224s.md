# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 5
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc)
*  The Nevada Republican Party isn't even the worst of them right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, sure, they are about to hold two separate and incompatible elections for the same office, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=2.52s)]
*  each with different names on the ballot each in the same week, but on different days. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=7.84s)]
*  And the Nevada State Republican Party reportedly has only one paid full-time staffer right now, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=12.8s)]
*  and their state party chairman is under felony indictment and about to stand trial. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Pity the Nevada Republican Party right now, but they are better off than some of the others. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=22.72s)]
*  At least they have a state party chair. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=26.96s)]
*  An indicted one, yes, but he has a job in nearby Arizona. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=30.0s)]
*  Big swing state, the Republican state party chair there just resigned in a weird bribery and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  leaked tape scandal. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=43.28s)]
*  In Florida, big important state, the Republican state party chair there was just fired against [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=45.36s)]
*  his will. In Michigan, big important swing state, the Republican party chair was just removed, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  but she refuses to leave. Both she and the guy who might be her replacement showed up [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=57.04s)]
*  at the Republican party's annual winter meeting this weekend, both claiming to be the chair of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=62.48s)]
*  the Michigan Republican party. The RNC has no idea what to do with this problem with two different [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=67.2s)]
*  people claiming to be the chair of the state party. For the purposes of the meeting this weekend, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=72.08s)]
*  they officially listed the Michigan Republican party chairman job as vacant, and they decided [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=75.84s)]
*  when both of the people who claimed to be the chairman showed up, they decided they would give [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=82.24s)]
*  passes to the meeting to both of the people who claimed to be the chair of the Michigan state [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=86.96s)]
*  party, but they only gave them guest passes, not like member passes or state party chair passes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=91.36s)]
*  So as guests, neither of them was able to vote on anything or participate in anything official. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=98.56s)]
*  Then I mentioned that it's an election year and that that's one of the most important swing states [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  in the country. Heading into the big Republican party meeting this weekend, it seemed like the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=109.12s)]
*  national chair of the Republican party might be thrown out of her job too. And you know that, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=116.24s)]
*  you know, makes sense just from a 30,000 foot perspective, even if you knew nothing about her, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  right? If you don't want to blame the party's electoral woes, since Donald Trump first came on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=127.44s)]
*  the scene in 2016, if you don't want to blame the party's electoral woes on him, well, she would be [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=134.88s)]
*  the obvious other person to blame as the chair of the Republican party during that time. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=141.36s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump became president in January 2017. He named her, Ronna McDaniel, to be the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=146.56s)]
*  chair of the Republican party in 2017. In her first election thereafter in 2018, the Republican [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=152.8s)]
*  party lost 40 seats and lost the House. The Republicans that year lost the popular vote in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  those midterm elections by the largest margin since the 1980s. Then in the next election in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  2020, the Republicans lost the White House and the Senate, as well as the House that they had [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=170.8s)]
*  previously lost. Trump and Ronna Romney McDaniel managed to lose both chambers of Congress and the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=176.24s)]
*  presidency in a single term, which is the first time that had happened since Herbert Hoover. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  Then next election, 2022, with Ronna Romney McDaniel still in charge at the RNC and Trump [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=188.4s)]
*  still effectively leading his party from the sidelines, the Republicans turned in a performance [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=194.08s)]
*  in the 2022 midterms that was the worst performance by a party not holding the White House [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=198.8s)]
*  in decades, arguably in a century. Even in 2023, last year, off-year elections, Democrats did [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  unexpectedly well in elections in Virginia and Kentucky and Ohio and every single darn place [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  that held any sort of referendum on abortion rights after Trump appointed judges overturned Roe v. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=218.88000000000002s)]
*  Trump. And now it's 2024. And Trump is very much still in charge. And three swing state Republican [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=224.16s)]
*  parties and counting are in total meltdown, but you're not allowed to blame Trump for any of that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  And so heading into the Republican Party's meeting, big annual winter meeting this weekend, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=237.12s)]
*  these were the headlines about the Republican Party chair. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  Mega Republicans rage at Ronna McDaniel over RNC failures. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=246.48s)]
*  Gotta blame someone. Let's throw her out. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=252.0s)]
*  Ronna Romney McDaniel did seem to survive the RNC's weekend meeting. At least it seemed that way when [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  things wrapped up at their big meeting on Saturday. But then on Sunday morning, Trump went back on Fox [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=263.76s)]
*  and said about Ronna Romney McDaniel, quote, I think she did okay initially in the RNC. I would [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=272.48s)]
*  say right now there will probably be some changes made. So he's saying he wants her out. Now he's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=278.16s)]
*  just done another interview with another right wing network where he said that she should be out [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=284.8s)]
*  of her job. He was asked, quote, is it time for Ronna McDaniel to step aside? He responded, well, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  I think she knows that. I think she understands that. Trump now put out a statement this evening [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=294.32s)]
*  saying that he will make his pronouncement on her fate later this month after the Republican [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=300.88s)]
*  primary in South Carolina. Okay, sure. But listen, maybe you don't need a party, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  or you don't need much of one. Each of the two major political parties in our country [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=315.92s)]
*  has done okay in previous election years, even when the parties themselves were organizationally [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  kind of a mess. What is different here, what's important for all of us here in this moment, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=325.2s)]
*  is that the Republican Party now in the age of Trump appears to be not just a mess. They appear [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  to be sort of dissolving themselves. Whatever happens to Ronna Romney McDaniel and however [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=339.44s)]
*  her leadership at the Republican National Committee is going to come to an end, the thing that she [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=348.4s)]
*  will likely go down for in history is the moment in 2020 when under her leadership, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=352.96s)]
*  the party decided there would no longer be a Republican Party platform. They decided that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  officially and explicitly the Republican Party would no longer stand for any particular thing, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=365.35999999999996s)]
*  other than generically saying that they supported Trump's overall agenda. We stand for nothing, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=371.2s)]
*  except whatever the leader wants. That was a signal moment. And it's a moment right now to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=377.6s)]
*  have all of this chaos in state Republican parties, including in some of the most important states in [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  the country for the election. I mean, if you are a Republican voter in Nevada, when do you vote for [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=392.24s)]
*  your choice for a Republican Party presidential candidate this week? Do you vote tomorrow? Do [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=397.20000000000005s)]
*  you vote Thursday? You can vote in both? How is that possible that you can vote in both? Well, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=401.44s)]
*  apparently that's because one's the official event run by the state, which doesn't count, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=406.0s)]
*  and one's not an official state run event, but it's the one that they're counting because that's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=411.12s)]
*  what Trump wanted. Okay. Does that make sense? Do you know how you're spending your week? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=415.12s)]
*  And let's hope this counting is done before the state party chairman is due in court [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=421.52s)]
*  to face his felony charges related to allegedly trying to falsify the results of the last election [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=425.84s)]
*  in that state. That's how Trump wants it. So that's his guy. So that's what Nevada Republicans are [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=431.04s)]
*  supposed to do this week. And no, let's not have any real Republican primary debates this whole year, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=438.16s)]
*  at least none that include the front running candidate, because that's also how he wants it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=444.16s)]
*  So that's what we'll do. And no, let's not have general election debates this year either, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  because in 2020 Trump got the Republican Party under Ronald McDaniel to say that the Republican [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=453.76s)]
*  Party will no longer allow its candidates to participate in events sponsored by the commission [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=459.12s)]
*  on presidential debates, which has overseen general election debates between presidential candidates [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=463.68s)]
*  for decades. He didn't want that. So we had the RNC pull out of that. So to recap, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=468.24s)]
*  it's a political party with no party platform, no normal nominating process for its nominees, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  no primary debates, and no general election debates. They're just coming off the worst [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=485.04s)]
*  back to back electoral performance by any party since before FDR. And it's all because it's what [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=490.32s)]
*  Trump wants. And of course, why would anything else matter? Because who could doubt the political [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  instincts of a man with this kind of a track record, right? With this kind of an electoral [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  track record, a man who handed out fake, I'm an auto worker signs in Michigan at a fake union event [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=508.0s)]
*  and then filed the receipts for it publicly. Who could doubt a man with political instincts [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=514.48s)]
*  of that level of genius? Why have a political party when you can just follow wherever he's leading? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=519.12s)]
*  Political parties are not the most important institutions in a democracy, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  but they are part of it. And right now in our country, one of our two major political parties [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=532.32s)]
*  is dissolving itself. And just tonight, potentially preparing to oust yet another of its top leaders, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=538.88s)]
*  all in the service of just doing stuff for their great leader, instead of doing normal party stuff [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=544.88s)]
*  and normal democracy stuff anymore. And I don't know how many of you watching this tonight, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=550.48s)]
*  you know, are mourning the illness and potential demise of the Republican party as an institution, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  I understand. But if we are going to stay a democracy with a two party system, there do need [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=563.6800000000001s)]
*  to be two parties of some kind, or we're not that kind of system anymore. We're going to have to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=569.2s)]
*  develop into something else. I mean, right now, what we are very fast becoming is one party on [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=574.96s)]
*  one side and just a guy on the other. A guy who this week is going before a United States Supreme [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=581.76s)]
*  Court that is going to decide if maybe he might be ineligible to ever hold federal office ever again. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=590.24s)]
*  What do you call that kind of system? What could possibly go wrong? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=596.16s)]
*  In 2019, in Oregon, Republicans in the state legislature walked out over a tax bill they [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=600.16s)]
*  didn't like. They left and they used their absence to deny the legislature a quorum, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=606.0s)]
*  which brought the legislature to a halt for days. Then a couple months later, they did it again. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=612.48s)]
*  This time it was a climate bill they objected to. Several of them in that case fled the state [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  when the governor of Oregon sent state police out to bring them back. One Republican senator [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=621.76s)]
*  said that the police had better quote, send bachelors and come heavily armed, as in don't [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=626.56s)]
*  send anyone with a wife because the wives will be sad when we kill the police officers you're sending. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=633.68s)]
*  There never was an armed showdown with state troopers, but the Republicans in Oregon did [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=640.72s)]
*  succeed in killing that climate change. The state legislature was not the only one to do that. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=645.04s)]
*  The state legislature in Oregon did succeed in killing that climate bill by using that tactic. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=650.0s)]
*  The next year they did it again. They walked out as a group two weeks before the end of the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=655.28s)]
*  legislative session and they never came back. That killed the climate bill again. It killed [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=658.96s)]
*  20 other pending bills that they decided just shouldn't be voted on at all. Then the following [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=662.96s)]
*  year, there were two more Republican walkouts several days each. Under the state constitution [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=668.48s)]
*  in Oregon, you need to have a quorum to have the legislature in session. Two-thirds of the [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=674.48s)]
*  state legislature has not been elected to do any business. When the Republicans have done these [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=679.92s)]
*  repeated walkouts, it has stopped the legislature from functioning for any purpose and it's happened [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  year after year after year. Oregon voters decided they didn't want this to happen anymore. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=689.28s)]
*  In 2022, Oregon voters voted to change the state constitution to try to fix this problem. By a very [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=695.76s)]
*  wide margin, Oregon voters enacted an amendment to the state constitution that says any legislator [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=702.4s)]
*  in unexcused absences is not allowed to run for reelection. So you don't get thrown out. You get [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=708.32s)]
*  to finish your turn, but you can't run again. Voters approved that as an amendment to the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=714.32s)]
*  constitution in 2022. And then what do you think happened in 2023? Not only did the Republicans [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=719.0400000000001s)]
*  and the legislature walk out again, they staged the longest legislative walkout in modern US history. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  Oregon Republicans left for six weeks. They staged a boycott over democratic legislation [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=734.0s)]
*  on abortion and other issues, but they just skedaddled. They got out. And if this tactic [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=740.56s)]
*  sounds familiar, it should. Both parties have done this in various states at various times. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=747.92s)]
*  Wisconsin Democrats famously did this to try to save union rights. Texas Democrats famously did it [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=752.72s)]
*  to try to stop a huge power grab by Republicans in Texas. Other states have done it. Other [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=758.48s)]
*  parties have done it. The difference here is that there are now consequences for doing it. Oregon [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=764.8s)]
*  voters overwhelmingly voted to change their state's constitution to say, okay, from here [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=771.04s)]
*  forward in our state, there will be consequences for you if you do this over and over again. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=776.16s)]
*  You will not be allowed to run for office again. And even after voters changed the state constitution [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=780.72s)]
*  to say that, the Republicans and the legislature just kept doing it. And so now their actions [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=787.68s)]
*  inevitably have produced consequences, very predictable consequences, but they're still [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=795.1999999999999s)]
*  shocking consequences. The Oregon Supreme Court has now ruled unanimously that sure enough, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=802.56s)]
*  these Republican senators, 10 Republican senators are no longer legally allowed to run for re-election. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=808.2399999999999s)]
*  They plainly and deliberately violated the newly amended state constitution, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=815.2s)]
*  so they can't run again. And obviously this is a huge deal in that state. I mean, this is almost [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=819.6s)]
*  all the Republicans. This is fully a third of the state Senate that has just been ruled ineligible [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=825.36s)]
*  to run again. So it's a big deal there. But also, yes, this is kind of a microcosmic version [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=831.84s)]
*  of what we're about to see on the federal level at the Supreme Court Thursday of this week, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=841.84s)]
*  when the country's top court decides whether Donald Trump himself can be blocked from the ballot [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=846.48s)]
*  for violating the U.S. Constitution. In a small and microcosmic way, a very consequential way, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=850.88s)]
*  they're doing it first in Oregon, right now. So how's that going? Joining us now is Julia Shumway. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=859.68s)]
*  She's deputy editor at the Oregon Capital Chronicle. Ms. Shumway, I really appreciate [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=866.16s)]
*  you making time to be here. Thanks very much. Thank you. What's been the reaction to this [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=869.52s)]
*  unanimous state Supreme Court ruling that says they can't run again? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=875.52s)]
*  There's been, I mean, it's generally been applauded by people who supported the amendment [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=879.68s)]
*  in the first place. The Republican state senators view this as a political act by the court. They [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=883.92s)]
*  noted that the court has been entire, the justices who ruled on this were entirely appointed by [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=890.96s)]
*  Governor Kate Brown, who was a Democrat. In terms of the fight here, obviously, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=897.36s)]
*  the state Supreme Court decision on a matter of state law and state constitutional authority, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=903.44s)]
*  you would think that would be the end. But I understand there's probably at least a, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=907.92s)]
*  there's a federal challenge that at least probably has some traction in terms of the way [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=913.2s)]
*  Republicans are going to try to advance their case. What's the status of their federal court [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=916.8000000000001s)]
*  challenge to this? Yeah, there's a separate federal lawsuit that was filed under First Amendment [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=920.64s)]
*  claims, essentially, that these Republican senators have a right to protest and their [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=926.48s)]
*  right to protest was being curtailed. A judge denied a preliminary injunction in that case [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=930.8s)]
*  in December. We're waiting to see and waiting on a ruling from the Court of Appeals, the Ninth [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=936.16s)]
*  Circuit Court of Appeals on an appeal to that ahead of the March 12th filing deadline here. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=942.72s)]
*  While the country is considering this disqualification issue for President Trump [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=949.28s)]
*  at the Supreme Court to have Oregon going through this exercise as really remarkable [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=953.2s)]
*  confluence of events. Julia Shumway, deputy editor at the Oregon Capital Chronicle, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=958.48s)]
*  thanks for helping us understand. I really appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=962.0s)]
*  One of the Republican candidates decided that he would take a different approach [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=966.8000000000001s)]
*  than all the others, perhaps sensing that Joe Biden was sort of meeting the moment here in [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=971.76s)]
*  a way that Republicans and Fox News weren't, you know, recognizing that Biden was siding with [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=976.1600000000001s)]
*  these autoworkers and the country was with him and with them on this. One of the Republican [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=982.0s)]
*  candidates did try to do something different. The day after Biden ended up on the picket line in [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=986.8s)]
*  Michigan, this one Republican candidate decided not to go to that Republican presidential candidates [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=991.68s)]
*  debate. He skipped it and instead he himself went to Michigan to go try to do basically what Biden [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=998.16s)]
*  did to go show up and be seen with the union autoworkers in Michigan. Kind of. Whereupon, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1007.84s)]
*  he promptly stepped on a rake. Trying to make it look like he was supporting these union autoworkers [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1016.96s)]
*  who were out on strike, who the whole country was rallying in support of, he instead went to a [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1022.32s)]
*  non-union auto parts facility. And while his campaign tried to convince people to say that he [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1026.64s)]
*  was there speaking to striking autoworkers, or at least he was speaking to autoworkers, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1032.56s)]
*  the problem was that real reporters actually went to the event and they realized quickly that this [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1037.52s)]
*  was a facility that doesn't have anybody in a union. And then the reporters did what reporters [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1042.8s)]
*  do. They talked to the people who were physically there. And so this was the Detroit news the next [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1048.4s)]
*  day. Quote, one individual in the crowd who held a sign that said union members for Trump acknowledged [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1053.04s)]
*  to a Detroit news reporter that she was not a union member. Another person with a sign that read [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1060.8s)]
*  autoworkers for Trump, when asked for an interview, said that he wasn't an autoworker. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1066.96s)]
*  Neither person provided their names. This was very embarrassing, right? He's trying to look like he [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1073.92s)]
*  was supporting the union, but he's at a non-union facility that he filled with people who were given [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1080.64s)]
*  signs and effectively told to pretend to be union workers or even to pretend to be autoworkers when [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1086.56s)]
*  they were no such thing. He did a fake event. I mean, the whole thing was fake. And then it was [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1092.8799999999999s)]
*  in the Detroit press the next day that it was fake. This you skipped the debate for? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1100.32s)]
*  It was so embarrassing at the time. And now, as of right now, there are receipts, literal receipts, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1106.32s)]
*  the campaign finance filings that just came out for all the various campaigns. Reporter Jonathan [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1113.84s)]
*  Usting at Bridge Michigan dug in and found that on that day in September, the Trump campaign [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1119.12s)]
*  indeed paid a $20,000 rental fee to pay to rent that auto parts plant, which was not a union [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1124.8s)]
*  facility. So he could pretend it was full of union autoworkers who supported him when it was [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1134.56s)]
*  actually just full of randos holding signs that said that's who they were, even though that's not [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1139.28s)]
*  who they were. It's just an amazing thing. I mean, you think of things that ended previous [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1144.56s)]
*  presidential campaigns, right? Howard Dean was too close to a microphone when he shouted with [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1151.36s)]
*  excitement after doing pretty well in the Iowa caucuses. Your campaign must end. You were too [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1156.08s)]
*  close to the microphone. Gerald Ford got lost in the middle of a sentence about Eastern Europe in [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1160.3999999999999s)]
*  a debate once. Poppy Bush said read my lips before he said no new taxes, which was like [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1165.6799999999998s)]
*  uncharacteristically memorable phrasing from him. And so people actually remembered it, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1170.72s)]
*  which turned out to be really bad for him when the no new taxes thing didn't really work out. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1174.72s)]
*  I mean, campaigns have been laid low by some dumb and small stuff. But here's a candidate [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1179.1200000000001s)]
*  faking a union event with fake union members and fake autoworkers who were given signs by the [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1187.2s)]
*  campaign to falsely identify themselves in the hopes that no one would check. And then they got [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1193.04s)]
*  caught. And it's like, what else you got? Did he ever wear a tan suit? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIFRmHaMVEc&t=1197.76s)]
