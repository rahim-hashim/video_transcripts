Video Description: Rachel Maddow uses examples from Dr. Anthony Fauci's new book and the fact that Trump Republicans are still busy trying to persecute Fauci despite his heroic role in navigating deadly pandemics to illustrate the authoritarian bent of the Republican Party in the Trump era that cannot accept a voice of authority or expertise that outshines their leader.

# Maddow: Dr. Fauci exemplifies the Trump Republican war on expertise
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM)
*  I mean, if you're done with politics and you just want to be in charge forever by force, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=0.0s)]
*  then no one can be allowed to contest the leader or to question the leader. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=7.0s)]
*  Importantly, nobody can be allowed to offer any alternative source of authority to the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=11.32s)]
*  leader. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=16.52s)]
*  So there can't be journalists who know stuff and report it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=17.88s)]
*  There of course can't be opposition politicians. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=22.04s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=23.92s)]
*  There can't ever be anyone who runs against him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=25.88s)]
*  And that would mean taking your life in your hands. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=28.02s)]
*  There can't be law enforcement that does anything independent of what the leader wants. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=30.46s)]
*  The whole government has to work entirely for the leader. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=34.24s)]
*  There's no government providing information and services like we're used to. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=37.58s)]
*  There's no state. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=42.1s)]
*  There's just the deep state, which is terrible and evil and against the leader. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=43.18s)]
*  And it must be purged, replaced just with people he likes and who do what he wants. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  The government cannot have a civil service that has subject matter experts because everybody [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=53.76s)]
*  has to work only for the leader. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=59.82s)]
*  We should be recommending you to be prosecuted. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  We should be writing a criminal referral because you should be prosecuted for crimes against [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  humanity. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=73.06s)]
*  You belong in prison, Dr. Fauci. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=74.06s)]
*  In the Trump era, in the Republican Party, this is what it's like to be the nation's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=78.46s)]
*  most esteemed public health official, the nation's top subject matter expert on infectious [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=82.5s)]
*  disease. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=87.98s)]
*  Dr. Anthony Fauci was the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=88.98s)]
*  for 38 years. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=93.9s)]
*  He has a new book that's out tomorrow. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=96.5s)]
*  It's called On Call, a Doctor's Journey in Public Service. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=97.94s)]
*  And in that book, he says that in the, quote, early days of the HIV AIDS pandemic, the aggressive [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=100.78s)]
*  hate mail that he got was, quote, homophobically motivated, criticizing me for wasting time [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=105.98s)]
*  trying to save mostly gay men who, quote, brought this all on themselves by their supposedly [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=111.58000000000001s)]
*  aberrant behavior. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=117.54s)]
*  With Ebola, he says, the hate mail seemed to be related to the perception by white supremacist [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=119.5s)]
*  types that I favored black Africans over the health of our country. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=124.34s)]
*  So that's the kind of hate mail he got in the AIDS era. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=130.74s)]
*  That's the kind of hate mail that he got in the Ebola era. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=132.98000000000002s)]
*  But in this era, in response to our most recent infectious disease threat, in the context [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=135.24s)]
*  of the Trump movement on the American political right, now the torrent of hate and threat [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=140.66s)]
*  is of a different order and a different magnitude. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=148.64s)]
*  It needs to be dealt with. The criminal gang leaders, the big heads of the central banks, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  Pfizer had Fauci, all of them that lied to Trump, we know, created the disinfo, already [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=159.28s)]
*  had the vaccine ready years before they released the virus. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=166.06s)]
*  They all need to go to prison for the rest of their lives. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=169.04s)]
*  It is the right thing to do that they be executed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=171.28s)]
*  I'm not a wimp. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=174.12s)]
*  I will volunteer. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=175.12s)]
*  I think it should be public. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=176.12s)]
*  I will pull the lever. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=177.12s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=178.12s)]
*  I don't have a bloodlust, but I don't want people to do work I wouldn't do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=179.12s)]
*  Dr. Fauci's new book, he tells the story of his decades in public service, serving seven [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=182.12s)]
*  different presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan, helping lead the response not only [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=189.28s)]
*  to HIV and AIDS domestically and around the globe, but also to Ebola and also Zika and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=193.68s)]
*  also SARS and also even the anthrax attacks after 9-11. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=198.76s)]
*  It's a 450 page book. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=202.88s)]
*  It comes out tomorrow. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=204.76s)]
*  As I mentioned, it is fascinating. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=205.76s)]
*  Every new crisis is a detective story and a science thriller and a political potboiler [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=207.56s)]
*  all rolled into one. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=213.32s)]
*  But the last hundred pages or so are about the COVID crisis and also about serving the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  trying to handle the COVID crisis under the most recent Republican president, under Donald [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=229.12s)]
*  And even though that part of Dr. Fauci's career in public service is over, he retired in 2022 [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=230.12s)]
*  after serving as President Biden's chief medical advisor. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=235.92s)]
*  Even though he is now out of public service after all of these decades, the Trump movement [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=239.12s)]
*  and its members in Congress and its supporters in the media are still going after Dr. Fauci [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=243.04s)]
*  as aggressively as ever, if not more so, even two years after he left government. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=248.32s)]
*  Because he epitomizes one of the things they are trying to destroy, one of the things that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=256.28s)]
*  they need to destroy in their revolutionary war against the American system of government. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=261.24s)]
*  It is not that they disagree with him. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=267.56s)]
*  It is not that they misunderstand. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  It is that he represents expertise. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=274.04s)]
*  Authority. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=277.16s)]
*  Earned by expertise. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  The way we use, the way we sort of shorthand that in life is that he's a person who knows [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=283.92s)]
*  what he's talking about. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=287.68s)]
*  And that of course is toxic for their political project. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=289.88s)]
*  That cannot be allowed to stand. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  And so he is still in the bullseye for them even now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=295.24s)]
*  This is from the book. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=298.72s)]
*  This is from August of 2020. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=299.72s)]
*  He says, quote, I had been absent for work for a few days because I had a benign polyp [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=301.92s)]
*  removed from one of my vocal cords. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=305.76s)]
*  I was just getting back into the swing of things, happy to be sitting at my desk in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=307.48s)]
*  my office going through mail that had piled up. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=310.44s)]
*  It was about 10.30 a.m. when I picked up a letter off of one of the stacks. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=312.8s)]
*  The envelope bore a Jacksonville, Florida return address. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  It was typewritten in an unusual font, but otherwise looked like the fan mail that I [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=319.68s)]
*  got every day. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=324.40000000000003s)]
*  Most of the time people ask me to sign a baseball card or an index card. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  Sometimes occasionally, he says, quote, they told me they hated me. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=329.24s)]
*  I opened the top of the envelope with a letter opener and took out a single sheet of folded [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=333.96s)]
*  white paper. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=337.88s)]
*  As I unfolded it, fine white powder shot up from the paper and drifted down onto my face, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=339.08s)]
*  my tie, my shirt, my hands, my pants, my desk and my chair. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=344.88s)]
*  I instantly feared anthrax or worse. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=350.0s)]
*  I immediately shouted to my assistant, Kim, do not come into my office. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=353.12s)]
*  Go get George and Brett, my security detail who were posted down the hall. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=357.24s)]
*  They sprinted to the doorway of my office, yelling, don't move, stay where you are. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=362.16s)]
*  Don't come out because you will contaminate everything else. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=366.44s)]
*  Following their instructions, I put the letter and envelope into a plastic bag for forensics. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=369.36s)]
*  George called the NIH Hazmat team who came to my office in their spacesuits. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=373.6s)]
*  They had me remove all of my clothes, which also went into a plastic bag, and they sprayed [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=378.12s)]
*  me down with chemical foam. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=382.58s)]
*  I thought, this is insane. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=384.36s)]
*  There I was standing naked, being sprayed down by guys in spacesuits. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=386.38s)]
*  My fate hinged on a call, giving me a preliminary analysis of the powder. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=391.7s)]
*  There were three possibilities. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=395.62s)]
*  It was a hoax and merely a harmless powder. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=396.62s)]
*  It was anthrax spores, and I would require four weeks of the antibiotic Cipro, but would [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=399.78s)]
*  probably survive. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=403.82s)]
*  Or it was ricin, and no matter what I did, I would be dead in a few days. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=405.98s)]
*  Ricin, which is formed from the seeds of castor beans, is lethal when inhaled or injected. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=410.46s)]
*  Christine, Dr. Fauci's wife, and our daughters were terrified that I might die. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=415.70000000000005s)]
*  Jenny was also furious, which is probably a reflection of her fear and concern for me. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=421.1s)]
*  Megan and Ali called multiple times asking, Dad, are you all right? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  Are you all right? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=428.66s)]
*  They all dreaded that I might say I was starting to feel sick. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=429.66s)]
*  My own emotions were complicated. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=433.26s)]
*  I felt like a complete idiot for opening what in retrospect was a suspicious letter, and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=434.62s)]
*  I was fatalistic about the outcome. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=439.22s)]
*  My mother died at age 56. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=441.82000000000005s)]
*  My father at 97. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=444.76s)]
*  At age 79 myself, I'd lived a long, full, happy life of achievement. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  My legal papers were in order because they're always in order. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=451.18s)]
*  As a physician, I've held the hands of many people as they died. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=454.76s)]
*  I do not fear death, but I was not ready to leave this earth yet, not by a long shot. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=457.24s)]
*  It should go without saying that this should not be something that happens in the life [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=462.12s)]

*  1.2 million Americans have died from COVID. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=473.36s)]
*  Dr. Fauci's book explains the government's response, the challenge of dealing with a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=476.76s)]
*  literally novel coronavirus, something new, learning as we go. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=481.8s)]
*  He also tells the story of trying to build a government response with a president who [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=487.38s)]
*  literally did not understand what was going on in some very fundamental ways, who told [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=492.04s)]
*  him, told Dr. Fauci, for example, that he didn't understand why he would get a flu [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  shot if he did not have the flu, as if he did not understand the difference between [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=502.72s)]
*  a treatment and a vaccine. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=508.08s)]
*  A president who asked why the flu vaccine couldn't just be used to prevent COVID, as [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=510.08s)]
*  if he didn't understand that diseases and viruses are different from one another. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=515.5600000000001s)]
*  A president who believed a Fox News host, Laura Ingraham, when she told him that there [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=520.24s)]
*  was a secret miracle cure for COVID. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=524.8s)]
*  A president who didn't understand how clinical studies disproving that had any more validity [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=528.28s)]
*  than what had been heard on the grapevine from someone he saw on the Fox News who had [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=533.64s)]
*  no subject matter expertise. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=537.76s)]
*  And it got worse from there. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=541.56s)]
*  This is also from Dr. Fauci's book. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=544.24s)]
*  Quote, on April 22nd, I attended a task force meeting where we were briefed by William [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=545.64s)]
*  N. Bryan, acting Undersecretary for Science and Technology at the Department of Homeland [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=550.12s)]
*  Security. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  Bryan explained two studies that showed how sunlight and humidity could kill the virus [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=555.24s)]
*  and substances such as isopropyl alcohol and disinfectants could be used effectively to [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=560.6s)]
*  clean non-porous surfaces. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=564.88s)]
*  The following day, he briefed the president in the Oval Office on these studies without [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=567.68s)]
*  Deborah Birx or me being present. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=571.68s)]
*  He then joined the president on the podium in the briefing room. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=574.8s)]
*  The result was the infamous press conference where Donald Trump appeared to endorse using [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=578.24s)]
*  bleach as a way to disinfect the lungs from COVID. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=582.36s)]
*  The president told the press, the White House press corps, quote, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=587.0s)]
*  Because you see, it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=599.24s)]
*  So it would be interesting to check that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=602.92s)]
*  Dr. Fauci says, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=607.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=613.16s)]
*  Poor Deb, meaning Deborah Birx, being on stage with the president during that musing, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  she must have been horrified. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=619.4s)]
*  And given her military background, it would have been difficult for her to contradict [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=620.84s)]
*  the commander in chief, especially publicly. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=624.36s)]
*  She looked as if she wanted to be any place other in the world but there. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  Sitting in front of the television, I knew we were going to have people who heard that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=632.6s)]
*  from the president and would then go ahead and try it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=635.88s)]
*  My phone immediately exploded with texts and calls asking me to comment. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=639.0s)]
*  I instantly realized that I and other scientists had to counter this message [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=643.32s)]
*  to keep Americans from ingesting bleach, which could literally kill them. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=647.8s)]
*  Dr. Anthony Fauci is in the bullseye of the Trump movement to this day, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=653.32s)]
*  as they seek to return to power. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=658.12s)]
*  He's in the bullseye of the Trump movement even after leaving the government. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=661.56s)]
*  And it is not because of COVID. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=665.4s)]
*  And it is not because of the controversial and difficult decisions of this most recent [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=667.08s)]
*  epidemic threat that he helped the country face down. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=670.6800000000001s)]
*  He has faced down plenty of those in his 54 years at NIH. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  What he's facing now is a political movement that cannot abide public health expertise at all, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=679.08s)]
*  because it cannot abide expertise at all, because that competes [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=685.08s)]
*  with the truths that are spouted from the head of the leader. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=690.9200000000001s)]
*  It is a movement that cannot abide authority and expertise from anyone other than their leader. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=694.44s)]
*  And they answer any such competition for him with menace. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=702.12s)]
*  And it's not romantic and it may be revolutionary, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=709.08s)]
*  but there's nothing sexy or dramatic or lovely about it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=713.0s)]
*  It is boring. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=716.6s)]
*  It is violent. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=717.72s)]
*  And it's about using force. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=719.0s)]
*  And it's a war against the U.S. system of government. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfPnu4vckNM&t=720.6s)]
