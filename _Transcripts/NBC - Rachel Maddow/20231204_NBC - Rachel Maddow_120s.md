# Cheney warns of Speaker Johnson's willingness 'to do things he knew to be wrong' for Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4)
*  One of the other things that you've talked about in terms of a second round and whether or not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=0.0s)]
*  January 6th was sort of a dress rehearsal or first effort and they'll be better at it the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=4.8s)]
*  second time around is the prospect that after the 2024 election maybe Republicans will still be in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=8.64s)]
*  control in the House, maybe Mike Johnson would still be Speaker. Given what Mike Johnson did [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=15.52s)]
*  in and around the 2020 election, what is the risk in terms of him potentially still being [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Speaker of the House, him controlling the House of Representatives in the aftermath of the next [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=28.24s)]
*  election? You know it's terrifying and I say that with no pleasure. It pains me that that's where we [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=32.72s)]
*  are but... You were friends with him. I was. We were elected the same year. Our offices were next [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=43.28s)]
*  door to each other and I believed Mike to be a man of principle. What I learned was that he was [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=48.64s)]
*  willing to do things he knew to be wrong in order to placate Donald Trump and again a situation [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  where you have a Speaker of the House who, as you detailed at the beginning of the show, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  so clearly set aside what he knew to be the facts, what he knew to be the law, what he knew to be our [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=67.2s)]
*  obligations under the Constitution in order to try to help Donald Trump in his efforts in 2020. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=72.64s)]
*  We cannot count on a majority of Republicans, on someone like that, to do the right thing, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=79.68s)]
*  to uphold the Constitution if, for example, we had an election that was thrown into the House [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=86.72s)]
*  if nobody got 270 electoral votes. So it's really serious. Or if they needed to certify [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  the electoral count. Yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6PApOBeIR4&t=97.52000000000001s)]
