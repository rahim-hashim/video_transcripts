# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: July 1
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk)
*  All right, we've got a bunch of stuff to cover tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=0.0s)]
*  First, the former president of the United States is going to be sentenced for 34 felony [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  convictions next week on Thursday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  The prosecutors who brought that case and who prosecuted in court that case against [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=10.84s)]
*  Donald Trump, they were due today to make their sentencing recommendation to the judge. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=15.92s)]
*  In a New York state case like this, it's not the jury that convicted Trump that will decide [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=23.92s)]
*  what his sentence is. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=29.52s)]
*  It's the judge who oversaw the case. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=31.0s)]
*  It's Judge Juan Marchand who will sentence Trump. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=32.76s)]
*  The maximum sentence under law that Trump could face is four years in prison. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=35.6s)]
*  It's very possible, however, that he might not get any prison time at all. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  Or if he does get a sentence of confinement, it's possible it could be home confinement. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=44.28s)]
*  We just don't know. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  On the one hand, what he's been convicted of, while it is 34 felonies, it's a nonviolent [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  crime. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=56.08s)]
*  And also he's a first-time offender. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=57.44s)]
*  He's never been convicted of anything before. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=59.32s)]
*  Those would certainly cut against him getting any significant jail time. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=61.72s)]
*  On the other hand, he does have three other major felony criminal cases pending against [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=66.56s)]
*  him at this moment. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=71.52s)]
*  He was fined by this judge for multiple violations of the court order in this case that required [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=72.76s)]
*  him to restrain himself from speaking about jurors and witnesses and court staff and the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  families of the judge and the lawyers in this case. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=82.84s)]
*  He's also shown absolutely no remorse whatsoever, which is the thing that judges are supposed [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=86.64s)]
*  to consider. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=91.44s)]
*  So all of those factors serve as sort of aggravating context. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=92.52s)]
*  Those might cut in favor of him getting jail time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=97.32s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=100.84s)]
*  This is why a person with the job title judge makes a decision like this and not randos [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=102.56s)]
*  like you or me. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=108.48s)]
*  Before the sentencing, the judge will get three pieces of advice, essentially, to help [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=111.5s)]
*  him make his decision. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=116.66s)]
*  He will get a not public facing confidential recommendation on Trump's proposed sentence [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=118.42s)]
*  from the probation department. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=126.18s)]
*  He will also get a sentencing recommendation from Trump's own lawyers, which presumably [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=128.18s)]
*  will be that he should get a cookie and a nice bag of treats because he's a good boy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=133.02s)]
*  And presumably he will also get the sentencing recommendation from prosecutors as well. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=138.17999999999998s)]
*  There is no rule about whether or not the prosecutor's sentencing recommendation is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=142.38s)]
*  made public either before the sentencing or during the sentencing or after that is all [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=147.61999999999998s)]
*  up to Judge Mershon as to whether he tells us what the prosecutors are asking for. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=152.14s)]
*  But I can also tell you tonight that it is not totally clear when the judge is going [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=157.5s)]
*  to get that sentencing recommendation from prosecutors. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=161.77999999999997s)]
*  It was due in today, but then something happened today. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=165.22s)]
*  Immediately following today's seismic Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, Trump's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=170.46s)]
*  lawyers asked the judge, advised the judge in the New York criminal case that they are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  going to ask him formally, they're going to file a motion asking him essentially to set [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=182.38s)]
*  aside Trump's guilty verdict, despite the jury's verdict in that case. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=187.86s)]
*  After the prosecutor, excuse me, after the defense, after Trump's lawyers notified the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=194.06s)]
*  judge that they were going to ask him to set aside the verdict, prosecutors then didn't [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=200.74s)]
*  send in their sentencing recommendations as they had been expected to do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=205.94s)]
*  Now as far as we know, the sentencing is still on. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=211.46s)]
*  But there is an element of uncertainty now as to what kind of a hitch this might be in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=215.36s)]
*  finishing up this criminal case in which Trump has already been convicted. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  We can report tonight that Trump's lawyers have asked that the sentencing itself be delayed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=224.5s)]
*  And we expect that Judge Marshawn will consider delaying the sentence after he gets that both [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=231.70000000000002s)]
*  that request from Trump's lawyers, but also after he hears from the prosecutors on that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=238.9s)]
*  matter. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=243.9s)]
*  Now that prosecutors have delayed submitting their sentencing recommendations, does that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=245.34s)]
*  mean the sentencing itself will be delayed? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=250.5s)]
*  Does that mean anything else material in terms of the sentence that Trump will likely face [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=252.46s)]
*  or when he will hear about it? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=256.86s)]
*  We don't know. We are waiting to hear from Judge Marshawn. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=259.1s)]
*  As we await Trump's sentencing in that case, this immunity ruling today from the Supreme [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=264.98s)]
*  Court is at hand. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=270.74s)]
*  And I'm not a lawyer. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=273.34000000000003s)]
*  It is, as far as I can tell, in my layman's understanding, it is as radical as anything [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=275.22s)]
*  I have ever seen from the United States Supreme Court. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=283.1s)]
*  I can certainly tell you that it is profoundly worse. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=286.54s)]
*  It is a profoundly worse ruling than even the most pessimistic observers predicted. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=289.76s)]
*  There was essentially one substantial aspect of immunity for Trump that Trump and his lawyers [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=295.38s)]
*  put to the court that they did not get. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=300.18s)]
*  That was this sort of internally contradictory, confusing proposal they'd made that a president [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=302.78s)]
*  could only be criminally prosecuted for crimes if you first impeached him in the House and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=307.5s)]
*  convicted him in the Senate. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=312.46s)]
*  The implication was that any failed impeachment effort would effectively immunize that behavior [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=314.46s)]
*  for life. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=320.97999999999996s)]
*  That thing about impeachment being connected in that way to a criminal prosecution, the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=323.34s)]
*  court threw that out as nonsense. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=328.74s)]
*  But they gave him everything else he asked for and more. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=330.3s)]
*  They gave him immunity in every other way that he asked for it, including for things [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=333.65999999999997s)]
*  his own lawyer conceded weren't among Trump's official acts as president. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=337.06s)]
*  Things that Trump's lawyer conceded were private acts were described in today's majority ruling [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=342.9s)]
*  as things for which Trump might nevertheless potentially get immunity. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=349.18s)]
*  So Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it in her dissent today. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=355.5s)]
*  She said that the court, quote, refuses to designate any course of conduct alleged in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=359.02000000000004s)]
*  the indictment as private despite concessions from Trump's counsel. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=362.90000000000003s)]
*  She continues, when asked about allegations that private actors helped implement a plan [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=367.66s)]
*  to submit fraudulent slates of presidential electors to obstruct the certification proceeding [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=372.26s)]
*  and Trump and a co-conspirator attorney directed that effort, Trump's counsel conceded the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  alleged conduct by Trump was private. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=382.24s)]
*  That says, quote, only the majority, meaning only the majority ruling in the court today [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=386.68s)]
*  thinks that organizing fraudulent slates of electors might qualify as an official act [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=392.56s)]
*  of the president. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  In other words, Trump may be even more protected from prosecution on the fake electors thing [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=400.52s)]
*  than even Trump asked for. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=405.48s)]
*  Justice Sotomayor's dissent is being cited widely today, not only because of its heat, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=409.28s)]
*  it is considerably hot, but also because of the light that it sheds on the practical consequences [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  of this ruling from the majority. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=422.52s)]
*  She says, quote, looking beyond the fate of this particular prosecution, the long term [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=425.56s)]
*  consequences of today's decision are stark. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=429.86s)]
*  The court effectively creates a law free zone around the president, upsetting the status [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=433.52s)]
*  quo that has existed since the founding. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  This new official acts immunity now lies about like a loaded weapon for any president that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=440.88s)]
*  wishes to place his own interests, his own political survival or his own financial gain [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=446.24s)]
*  above the interests of the nation. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=450.96s)]
*  The president of the United States is the most powerful person in the country and possibly [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=453.4s)]
*  the world. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=457.4s)]
*  When he uses his official powers in any way under the majority's reasoning, he now will [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=458.4s)]
*  be insulated from criminal prosecution, orders the Navy's SEAL Team Six to assassinate a [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=462.84s)]
*  political rival immune, organizes a military coup to hold on to power. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=467.86s)]
*  Immune takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=472.42s)]
*  Immune, immune, immune. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=475.7s)]
*  Let the president violate the law. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=480.06s)]
*  Let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=482.02000000000004s)]
*  Let him use his official power for evil ends, because if he knew that he may one day face [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=485.14s)]
*  liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=490.42s)]
*  to be. That's the majority's message today. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=495.16s)]
*  Even if these nightmare scenarios never play out, and I pray they never do, the damage [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=498.1s)]
*  has been done. The relationship between the president and the people he serves has shifted [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=502.62s)]
*  irrevocably in every use of official power. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=506.90000000000003s)]
*  The president is now a king above the law. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=510.58000000000004s)]
*  She closes, quote, Never in the history of our republic has a president had reason to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=514.22s)]
*  believe that he would be immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=518.58s)]
*  office to violate the criminal law. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=522.94s)]
*  Moving forward, however, all former presidents will be cloaked in such immunity. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=525.1800000000001s)]
*  If the occupant of that office misuses official power for personal gain, the criminal [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=529.5s)]
*  law that the rest of us must abide will not provide a backstop. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=534.7s)]
*  She says, quote, With fear for our democracy, I dissent. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=539.9000000000001s)]
*  Justice Sotomayor's dissent was joined today by Justice Kagan and Justice Jackson, the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=545.9000000000001s)]
*  three of them. And through Justice Sotomayor's writing, this dissent, they have at least [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=552.06s)]
*  done us the favor of writing what's kind of a speaking dissent. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=556.5799999999999s)]
*  It spells out not in legalese, but in plain English, the stark consequences of this [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=559.9399999999999s)]
*  ruling today. To his credit, actually, President Biden did the same tonight at the White [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=565.66s)]
*  House. He said, quote, Today's decision almost certainly means there's no limits to what a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=570.8199999999999s)]
*  president can do. This is a fundamentally new principle and it's a dangerous precedent. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=575.5s)]
*  The power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law, even the Supreme Court [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=579.7s)]
*  of the United States. The only limits will be self-imposed by the president alone. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=584.74s)]
*  But there are two practical consequences of this ruling that I feel like I need help in [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=593.34s)]
*  understanding tonight. I am worried about both of them, I have to tell you, but I feel [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=599.22s)]
*  like I need expert advice in terms of understanding what they really mean. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=602.62s)]
*  And so I'm going to ask for some help on two things in particular. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=607.2600000000001s)]
*  The first is this, which is not from the dissent, but from the actual ruling. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=611.74s)]
*  It's talking about the part of the federal indictment against Trump for the overthrowing [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=615.5400000000001s)]
*  the government stuff, for the January 6th stuff, the part of the indictment that relates to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=621.7800000000001s)]
*  him trying to use the Justice Department, trying to employ the Justice Department basically [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=625.22s)]
*  as a tool in his scheme to overthrow the government and hold on to power after he lost [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=631.1400000000001s)]
*  the election. On that point specifically, the ruling says this quote, The indictments [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=636.74s)]
*  allegations that the requested investigations were shams or proposed for an improper purpose [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=642.26s)]
*  do not divest the president of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=649.0600000000001s)]
*  functions of the Justice Department and its officials because the president cannot be [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=654.66s)]
*  prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=659.14s)]
*  Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussion, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=663.02s)]
*  his discussions with Justice Department officials, absolutely immune from anything related to [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=669.38s)]
*  his discussions with Justice Department officials. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=676.18s)]
*  My question is, doesn't that mean the president, any president here is being given overt carte [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=680.18s)]
*  blanche from the court that he or she can tell the Justice Department to do anything [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=686.38s)]
*  for any reason and it can never be reviewed for the life of that president? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=690.86s)]
*  Because if so, among other things, Richard Nixon would like his presidency back, please. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=697.62s)]
*  If if if everything that happens between a president and his Justice Department is absolutely [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=703.46s)]
*  immune from the criminal law, is absolutely immune from not only the prosecution, but [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=709.74s)]
*  investigation by the courts as a potential potentially criminal matter, that means that the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=715.34s)]
*  president can do things with the Justice Department that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=720.1s)]
*  I mean, what's the limit? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=725.38s)]
*  My second question is about what happens next in that federal case reference there about [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=729.62s)]
*  January 6th, the justices and the majority today, the judge with Chief Justice Roberts [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=735.5400000000001s)]
*  writing for them, said explicitly that they want portions of this case sent back to the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=740.98s)]
*  district court. So not the part that relates to Trump talking to Justice Department officials, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=746.34s)]
*  but the other parts of it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=751.86s)]
*  They want those parts of the indictment sent back to the district court, meaning to back to back to [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=754.4200000000001s)]
*  Judge Tonya, Chuckin's courtroom in Washington, D.C., essentially for her to determine in her [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=759.14s)]
*  courtroom whether or not Trump's Trump's actions as described in the indictment were [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=764.5s)]
*  official and therefore immune or were they not official, which might mean that charges on those [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=769.5s)]
*  matters can go ahead. What does that mean exactly? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=775.58s)]
*  What are the justices saying should happen in Judge Chuckin's courtroom and when and what will that look [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=779.4200000000001s)]
*  like to an American public that really is actively considering right now whether to send this [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=785.5s)]
*  particular felon back to the White House thanks to the Republican Party of the United States? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=791.34s)]
*  I concur with Justice Sotomayor's dissent today. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=798.3000000000001s)]
*  She hears what she said. She said, in every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=801.94s)]
*  With fear for our democracy, I dissent, end of quote. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=809.94s)]
*  Associated American people dissent. I dissent. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=815.34s)]
*  President Biden tonight at the White House responding to the Supreme Court's ruling that hands [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=821.1s)]
*  presidents, including himself, absolute immunity from prosecution for anything they can successfully [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=825.7s)]
*  argue was an official act. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=832.3000000000001s)]
*  The president name checked Justice Sonya Sotomayor's blistering dissent, which she delivered from the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=835.26s)]
*  bench at the court today. That dissent started, quote, Today's decision to grant former [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=840.82s)]
*  presidents criminal immunity reshapes the institution of the presidency. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=845.94s)]
*  It makes a mockery of the principle foundational to our constitution and system of government that [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=850.22s)]
*  no man is above the law. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=855.02s)]
*  Relying on little more than its own misguided wisdom about the need for bold and unhesitating [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=856.6999999999999s)]
*  action by the president, the court gives former President Trump all the immunity he asked for and [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=862.22s)]
*  more. She said, quote, Because our constitution does not shield a former president from [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=867.42s)]
*  answering for criminal and treasonous acts, I dissent. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=872.74s)]
*  Then she laid out the basis for her dissent. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=878.1s)]
*  Normally, when Supreme Court justices dissent, they use the word respectfully saying I [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=880.6600000000001s)]
*  respectfully dissent today. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=884.46s)]
*  Justice Sotomayor and also Justice Katanji Brown Jackson each struck the word respectfully and [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=886.4200000000001s)]
*  just wrote, I dissent. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=891.5400000000001s)]
*  And that is the kind of reaction we are seeing from legal scholars and experts everywhere today. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=893.5400000000001s)]
*  NPR's veteran legal correspondent, Nina Totenberg, just telling us moments ago that legal [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=898.26s)]
*  observers and experts, including what she described as sort of the both both sides of the aisle, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=903.46s)]
*  meaning both sides of the ideological number line, were, in her words, astonished by how [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=907.38s)]
*  radical this ruling was today. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=913.86s)]
*  Sherrilyn Eiffel, the former president and director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=916.14s)]
*  she responded to the ruling today by saying this. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=920.5400000000001s)]
*  She said, quote, Today's decision in Trump versus United States is a grotesque and hideous [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=923.1800000000001s)]
*  distortion of the rule of law by a majority of the highest court of the most powerful [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=928.62s)]
*  democracy in the world. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=933.78s)]
*  The national and global implications of upending this core principle of democracy is potentially [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=935.38s)]
*  catastrophic national and global implications. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=941.1s)]
*  Catastrophic. Joining us now is Sherrilyn Eiffel. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=945.66s)]
*  She is now the Vernon E. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=947.8199999999999s)]
*  Jordan, Jr. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=949.1s)]
*  Distinguished Chair in Civil Rights at Howard Law School. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=950.1s)]
*  Miss Eiffel, it makes me happy to see your face. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=953.86s)]
*  I'm really glad that you could be here tonight of all nights. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=956.9399999999999s)]
*  Thank you for making the time. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=959.14s)]
*  Of course. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=962.1s)]
*  So Justice Roberts criticized the liberal justices' dissent today, said they were [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=963.86s)]
*  striking a tone of chilling doom, essentially saying calm down, ladies, accusing them of [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=971.02s)]
*  overreacting and of portraying this ruling's consequences as something that they are not. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=977.22s)]
*  You clearly think the consequences of this ruling are, in your words, potentially [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=982.18s)]
*  catastrophic. Can you explain why you think so? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=986.54s)]
*  Yeah, I do. I do. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=990.9399999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel, for having me. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=992.1s)]
*  That was part of what was so disturbing about Chief Justice Roberts' opinion. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=994.7s)]
*  You know, if you're going to burn the house down, don't be mad that people call it arson. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=999.22s)]
*  You know, this decision is I talked about it being, you know, having catastrophic [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1004.66s)]
*  consequences because precisely of what Justice Sotomayor says about the rule of law, there is [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1009.78s)]
*  no question about the rule of what the rule of law means. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1015.38s)]
*  It means that the law applies equally to all rich and poor, high born and low born, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1017.78s)]
*  black, white, Latino. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1025.06s)]
*  It means that the one that one principle of law applies to everyone equally. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1027.86s)]
*  And the president, once he is no longer a president, is a citizen of the United States. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1033.46s)]
*  And therefore, the presumption is that he is covered as well by the rule of law. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1038.82s)]
*  To shatter that today is so incredibly shocking that I think many people are back on their heels. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1043.42s)]
*  And I say that it has global implications because our country is a tremendously influential [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1050.94s)]
*  country because of our power, because of our history, because of our national identity that we have [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1057.26s)]
*  worked so hard to to press to other nations. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1063.78s)]
*  We have held ourselves up as an exemplar of democracy. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1068.6200000000001s)]
*  And for the highest court in our land to send a signal not only to those in this country, but to the rest of the world, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1073.1s)]
*  that the rule of law is something that can be interrupted for a president of your same political party is incredibly [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1079.22s)]
*  dangerous. And the worst part of it, Rachel, is this is not a theoretical conversation. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1086.74s)]
*  We actually have experience with former President Trump. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1092.42s)]
*  We know what he is capable of. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1097.1s)]
*  We know the kind of excesses that he would like to and did engage in as president. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1098.8999999999999s)]
*  So this is not a case in which the court did not have before it the evidence of someone who would dangerously use the [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1105.3s)]
*  power that they so recklessly put in the hands of any president today. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1111.3s)]
*  I was interested in the in the way that Justice Sotomayor and her dissent kept going back to the particularities of the [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1116.5s)]
*  indictment and Trump's conduct, as if to say this is not a theoretical matter. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1122.62s)]
*  This is not something that we are describing, describing or deciding in the abstract. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1126.82s)]
*  I think making making that exact point implicitly. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1132.34s)]
*  Let me ask you about the very dark potential consequence of this. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1136.1399999999999s)]
*  And this, again, was raised explicitly by Justice Sotomayor. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1141.54s)]
*  The implications of the hypothetical assassination scenario. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1145.78s)]
*  You know, let's say a president ordered an element of the military to carry out an attack on somebody who he saw as a [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1150.46s)]
*  danger or as a political rival. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1159.78s)]
*  The justices seem to have made clear that that if the order to kill the person could be construed as something that was [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1162.66s)]
*  official, that the immunity matter is settled and that would actually be something for which a president could never be [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1170.78s)]
*  prosecuted. Is it that simple? [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1175.98s)]
*  I mean, how would that actually work in the legal system? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1178.9399999999998s)]
*  You know, it seems it seems impossible to imagine that that could be what they mean, although the plain reading of what [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1184.58s)]
*  they wrote, that is what they mean. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1190.02s)]
*  And we have a former president who, you remember, asked his defense secretary why we why they couldn't just shoot [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1191.62s)]
*  protesters, Black Lives Matter protesters in the legs. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1199.22s)]
*  This is someone who actually thinks in that way. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1203.1s)]
*  Now, one of the things that held Trump back when he was president was that very often the people around him would not [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1206.38s)]
*  carry out the things he asked them to do. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1212.42s)]
*  He asked his White House counsel over and over again to fire Jeff Sessions and he wouldn't do it. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1214.78s)]
*  He constantly asked people to do things and they would ignore him knowing that he wouldn't do it himself. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1219.9s)]
*  He wouldn't do it himself because he was at that time unsure of his liability. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1225.9s)]
*  Now he is sure that this Supreme Court thinks he would have no liability. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1230.54s)]
*  So, first of all, we have a category of things he can do himself. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1234.46s)]
*  He can strip military members from from their ranks for not following his orders. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1238.02s)]
*  He can accept cash bribes for pardons. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1244.46s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of things he can do, but then he also can order others to do things. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1248.3799999999999s)]
*  And the people that he's going to have if he is elected in his cabinet in his second round are going to be people of [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1253.46s)]
*  considerably less restraint than those he had the first time around and they were not particularly restrained. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1260.1s)]
*  So what this court has opened up to us is a true danger. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1266.22s)]
*  It is unleashed the full power of someone who has shown themselves to be utterly unfit to lead this country, someone [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1270.3799999999999s)]
*  who has no regard for restraint or ethics. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1277.62s)]
*  And and the fact that you can litigate it later, the fact that you can return to the district court or that you [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1281.8999999999999s)]
*  can address these matters in a lower court to make their way back up to the Supreme Court won't change the fact that [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1289.82s)]
*  people will be harmed, that people can be harmed and that our systems of government and that the rule of law can be even [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1297.1s)]
*  further degraded. Somewhere along the way, there are a majority of justices on this court who decided that they needed to [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1303.3799999999999s)]
*  be the last word on everything, that they could no longer trust the apparatus of democracy. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1310.34s)]
*  They could no longer trust federal agencies, thus overturning Chevron. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1315.06s)]
*  They could no longer trust women to make decisions about their bodies. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1318.66s)]
*  They could no longer trust university officials to decide how to build their classes. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1321.66s)]
*  And they could no longer trust the political system to to decide fairly how to pick their representatives so they [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1325.74s)]
*  couldn't interfere with partisan gerrymandering. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1332.82s)]
*  Now they've decided that determining whether or not the law covers the president of the United States and how much it does [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1335.3799999999999s)]
*  and when it does and when it doesn't is fully in their hands. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1342.26s)]
*  And they have just cut a wide swath of the president's actions, powers, official and unofficial that they have deemed [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1346.18s)]
*  barred from criminal prosecution. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1354.8600000000001s)]
*  It's stunning. And I hope people understand how significant this is, how much this day is one that will be remembered as as [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1357.1000000000001s)]
*  one that has very serious consequences for our understanding of the rule of law in this country. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1364.9s)]
*  We had better wake up and understand the consequences of this election and understand the consequences of having allowed a [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1370.34s)]
*  Supreme Court to have this kind of power in which they believe they cannot be checked by any level of government in our [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1376.5s)]
*  society and not trust the American people to make decisions for themselves. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1383.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm so alarmed. I'm so disturbed. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1387.98s)]
*  But I would say I feel also a sense of resolve. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1391.4599999999998s)]
*  I think they have fully shown themselves. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1394.06s)]
*  This court has played its hand. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1396.1799999999998s)]
*  Anyone pretending that we don't know what's going on with this court is doing that, is pretending. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1398.14s)]
*  And I think we now have to get very serious about what it means. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1403.54s)]
*  We are allowed to protect our democracy and we have to do so. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1406.74s)]
*  We have to do so at the ballot box. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1409.74s)]
*  And then once we prevail in elections, we have to make real decisions about what we want to do to ensure the Supreme Court is [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1411.54s)]
*  ethical, that the Supreme Court is acting in a way that is democratic. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1418.1s)]
*  And we have to pass laws that will close all of these loopholes that have been left open because we had the [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1421.7s)]
*  temerity to believe that norms and ethics would guard us against certain kinds of conduct. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1428.02s)]
*  That has not proven to be true. And so we have a lot of work to do. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1433.26s)]
*  And in the very near term, in four months, we will be making a decision about whether about who should be in the Oval [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1437.58s)]
*  Office holding what is now effectively unlimited and tyrannical power and what kind of person ought to be entrusted with [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1444.54s)]
*  that, which nobody should ever be entrusted with. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1453.18s)]
*  But now that's what we have. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1455.1s)]
*  Cheryl and I full now Howard Law School. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CFu8Ju-kSk&t=1456.86s)]
