# DOJ Acknowledges Investigation Of Fake Trump Electors; Clarifies Scope Of DOJ 1/6 Probe
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac)
*  This is the splash headline at the front page at CNN.com right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=0.0s)]
*  As you see there, it says, federal prosecutors looking at fake elector certificates. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=5.0s)]
*  At last. We have confirmation of what we thought might be going on here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=12.0s)]
*  Last night on the show, we talked about new reporting from Politico, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=17.0s)]
*  which indicates that investigators at the National Archives have themselves apparently [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=21.0s)]
*  opened a federal investigation into at least one set of these forged fake Republican electors [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=27.0s)]
*  from Arizona in the case of that reported investigation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=33.0s)]
*  We have also reported on attorneys general in at least two states referring this matter formally [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=37.0s)]
*  to federal prosecutors, to the U.S. attorneys in their states as a matter for potential federal criminal prosecution. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=42.0s)]
*  Well, now tonight, the story moves forward. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=49.0s)]
*  Thanks to a very rare interview that CNN scored with Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=52.0s)]
*  CNN has now got the U.S. Justice Department commenting on the record for the first time [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=58.0s)]
*  on the requests that they have received from state officials and others to investigate these forgeries, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=65.0s)]
*  to investigate the Republican electoral elector forgeries as as potential federal crimes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=71.0s)]
*  Quote, federal prosecutors are reviewing fake electoral college certifications that declared former President Donald Trump [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=79.0s)]
*  the winner of states that he lost, according to Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=85.0s)]
*  Monaco said, quote, we have received those referrals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=90.0s)]
*  Our prosecutors are looking at those. And I can't say anything more on ongoing investigations. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=94.0s)]
*  So there it is. Welcome to the ongoing investigation phase, everyone. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=103.0s)]
*  Everybody's been wondering if the United States Justice Department was going to let the whole overthrow the government thing just slide. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=109.0s)]
*  If the only people who are going to be even investigated for that plot to overthrow the U.S. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=115.0s)]
*  government were the low level people who took part in the smash and grab violent part of the scheme [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=119.0s)]
*  that played out at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th last year. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=125.0s)]
*  Well, now we know there are ongoing investigations into another part of the plot. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ9mulMd2Ac&t=129.0s)]
