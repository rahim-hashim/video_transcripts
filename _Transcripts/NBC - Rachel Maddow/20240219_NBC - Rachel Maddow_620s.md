# Maddow: The world needs Russian dissidents against growing threat of Putin aggression
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM)
*  If you're a dissident in Russia, if you defect from Russia, if you turn against Putin in Russia, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=0.0s)]
*  doesn't matter if you are no longer in Russia, he will send assassination teams anywhere in the world and hunt you down. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=5.64s)]
*  So there's a there's a clear message here, obviously, right? Don't be a Russian dissident. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Anywhere in the world, at least that's the very clear message from Vladimir Putin. The message from the rest of the world, of course, is [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=18.62s)]
*  do, do please be a Russian dissident because the world needs you to. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=26.68s)]
*  Because Vladimir Putin, now in his 25th year in power, is not someone for whom his ambitions or the damage [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=35.44s)]
*  he's willing to impose are things that are confined by Russia's borders. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=42.28s)]
*  He operates anywhere in the world doing whatever he wants. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=47.28s)]
*  It's like he can't try any harder to make clear that this is a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=51.08s)]
*  this is a whole world problem. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=55.800000000000004s)]
*  Now, let me let me show you part of a report that Richard Engel aired tonight on NBC Nightly News. Watch this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=58.24s)]
*  The Ukrainians broadcast warnings telling Russian troops to stop shelling at the risk of a nuclear disaster. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=67.0s)]
*  The warnings went unheeded. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=76.2s)]
*  Russian troops occupied the plant and the territory around it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=79.2s)]
*  Ukrainian forces held on to the far bank of the Dnieper River, leaving the nuclear power station right on the front line. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  Two years on, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has inspectors at the plant, is sounding the alarm. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  You're responsible for nuclear security all around the world. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=102.44s)]
*  Is this the most dangerous nuclear facility on the planet right now? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=102.94s)]
*  It's the most dangerous situation that we have. It's my job not to, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=107.88s)]
*  you know, panic, but at the same time I have to tell the truth of what is happening. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=113.44s)]
*  Nuclear experts point to three main dangers. First, a military strike on the plant, either accidental or deliberate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=120.52s)]
*  Second, a power cut. The plant's six uranium reactors require electricity for cooling. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=128.68s)]
*  But Ukrainian officials say three of the four power lines are damaged and the fourth is faulty. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=134.96s)]
*  There have already been eight blackouts as recently as December. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=141.64s)]
*  When you have a blackout, the cooling function of the reactors is lost and you could have a meltdown. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=145.48s)]
*  And finally, it's understaffed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=153.32s)]
*  Ukrainians say the Russians have been abusing employees. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=155.76s)]
*  11,000 people worked at the plant before, only 4,000 work there now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=160.0s)]
*  Irina Kokot is responsible for radiation detection for the Ukrainian government. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=165.88s)]
*  Her office predicts how, if there was a meltdown, a cloud of radioactive particles would spread across much of Ukraine and neighboring countries. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=170.88s)]
*  This is Istanbul, right here, the city of Istanbul. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=180.28s)]
*  Contaminated the entire city of Istanbul on the Black Sea? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  High level of contamination, yes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=188.32s)]
*  Catastrophe, a total catastrophe. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=190.76s)]
*  She says the fallout would last up to 100 years. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=192.76s)]
*  A nuclear disaster here would be felt around the world and leave large parts of Ukraine and beyond uninhabitable. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=196.76s)]
*  That is part of what Putin is bringing to bear on the rest of the world right now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=204.76s)]
*  You may also have seen the news just a few days ago, which started off as a sort of cryptic warning from the Intelligence Committee in the House [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=210.76s)]
*  about some kind of grave new national security threat from Russia that the American government needed to be addressing and talking to Congress about. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=218.2s)]
*  It started off with that cryptic letter from the House Intelligence Committee chairman. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=227.2s)]
*  It was soon reported all over the place that the point of concern was Russia developing a new nuclear capability that they would deploy in space. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=232.2s)]
*  A nuclear weapon, they have thousands of nuclear weapons just like we do, except this one would be put into orbit around the Earth. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=240.64s)]
*  So it could strategically be detonated to wipe out satellites orbiting the planet, which would have the effect down here on Earth of wiping out not only communications technology, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=248.64s)]
*  but navigation and military capabilities like missile defense. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=261.64s)]
*  The New York Times summed it up like this, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=266.64s)]
*  So here's the game plan, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=297.08s)]
*  We'll assassinate our enemies anywhere on Earth, including in Western Europe and even the United States, by any means we choose, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=299.08s)]
*  including by the use of military-grade nerve agents that we will dump willy-nilly in civilian areas, thus killing bystanders. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=305.08s)]
*  We will bring a war inside the gates of one of the world's largest active nuclear plants, threatening a continent-wide, century-long radiation disaster, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=315.08s)]
*  and no one and nothing is allowed to protect that site. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=325.52s)]
*  We'll do what we want with it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=327.52s)]
*  And we'll put nuclear weapons in orbit around the Earth for the first time in human history, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=329.52s)]
*  so we have the power to knock out not just your GPS and your cell phones, but your emergency systems and your power grids and your water systems and everything else. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=335.52s)]
*  Oh, and we'll invade Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014 and Ukraine again in 2022. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=345.52s)]
*  We'll get Europe back into the game of large land wars for the first time since World War II. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=350.96s)]
*  At the Munich Security Conference this weekend in Germany, NATO Secretary General shared new NATO intelligence. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=358.96s)]
*  He repeatedly shared new NATO intelligence that they believe what Putin intends to do next is try and attack on one of the smaller NATO countries on its border. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=364.96s)]
*  Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Baltic states, they are all NATO members. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=375.96s)]
*  New NATO intelligence says that Putin's next designs are on one of them. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=380.4s)]
*  If he indeed attacks one of them, which NATO now says they think he is planning on, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=384.4s)]
*  that would bring Russia into war with all 31 countries that are part of the NATO alliance, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=388.4s)]
*  which includes a little country called the United States of America. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=394.4s)]
*  There is not another entity like this on Earth. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=401.4s)]
*  There is not another country on Earth that is doing anything like this. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=404.4s)]
*  There is not another leader on Earth that is doing anything like this. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=407.84s)]
*  And so what do we do about it? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=414.84s)]
*  What do we, the United States, do about it? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=415.84s)]
*  What does the world do about it? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=417.84s)]
*  This is what the Russian embassy in London looks like in normal times, on a normal day. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=421.84s)]
*  This is what it looked like this weekend. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=428.84s)]
*  On the right side of your screen, that's what it looked like this weekend after Putin killed Russia's charismatic, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=430.84s)]
*  creative opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, at the age of 47 at a Siberian prison camp. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=436.28s)]
*  At the Russian embassy in London, they projected this image of Navalny onto the side of the building. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=444.28s)]
*  You see it takes up basically the whole side of the Russian embassy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=449.28s)]
*  Our Russian embassy is all over the world this weekend, in Eastern Europe, in Western Europe, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=453.28s)]
*  as far away as India, at the Russian consulate in New York, at the Russian embassy in DC. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=458.28s)]
*  People left flowers and signs in Alexei Navalny's name. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  Inside Russia, anybody leaving flowers or leaving signs or even just showing up in public to pay their respects, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=471.71999999999997s)]
*  for most of the weekend they got beaten up and hauled off by police. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  Hundreds of people. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  Arrested this weekend, literally for laying flowers in public, for holding a sign with Navalny's name on it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  In Munich, at that international Munich security conference, right after Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about the need [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  for the world to help Ukraine defend itself against this now two-year long Russian invasion, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  Alexei Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalny, appeared without announcement after Vice President Harris spoke. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  She appeared to everyone's surprise, making unannounced remarks, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=515.72s)]
*  asking the world to stand up, to stand together, to fight against the Putin regime in Russia. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=520.1600000000001s)]
*  Then this weekend she posted this sort of stunning, straight-to-camera video in Russian, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=529.1600000000001s)]
*  saying that she is not afraid that she will carry on her husband's work. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  She said that will start by naming and showing the faces soon of the people who carried out the murder of her husband at that prison camp. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  She said people do not need to be afraid, they need to do everything they can to fight against Putin's regime. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=549.6s)]
*  And of course we have to wonder if she is now marking herself for death as well, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=555.6s)]
*  by stepping forward into that kind of a role now that her husband has been killed for it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=561.6s)]
*  The whole world needs for there to be Russian dissidents. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=569.6s)]
*  Because the world needs for Russia to change. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=574.6s)]
*  The whole world needs for there to be Russian dissidents and needs for them to not only survive, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=578.0400000000001s)]
*  but ultimately to win. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  Because of the incredible threat, an increasing threat, an increasingly aggressive and unconstrained threat [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=586.0400000000001s)]
*  that Putin poses to the rest of the world as long as he remains in charge of Russia. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kw0L_whXOM&t=594.0400000000001s)]
