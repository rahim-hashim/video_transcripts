# Republican Senate candidate's dubious living situation raises legal questions about his vote
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c)
*  Some unexpected stuff going on in some U.S. Senate races right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, first of all, just the fact that incumbent Republicans in both Florida and Texas, these [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=3.84s)]
*  safe red states, are facing actual honest-to-goodness fights to keep their seats. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=9.68s)]
*  Ted Cruz in Texas and Rick Scott in Florida—Rick Scott in Florida is buying another $10 million [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=15.76s)]
*  of TV ads for the final weeks of the race, shelling out his own money. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=21.36s)]
*  Then there's Pennsylvania, where the Republican Senate candidate this weekend decided to campaign [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  outside a cheesesteak shop in North Philly. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=30.96s)]
*  That event ended with the manager of the cheesesteak shop saying that Republican Dave McCormick is, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=33.68s)]
*  quote, not welcome back. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  You're not welcome back. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=40.88s)]
*  Then Dave McCormick crossed the street to a local Baptist church, where the pastor there [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=43.2s)]
*  asked McCormick and his entourage to leave, because he didn't, among other things, want [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  photos of his church's members to be used by McCormick's campaign. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=52.64s)]
*  The pastor said, quote, you can Photoshop. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=56.56s)]
*  You can make things seem like they aren't. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=59.2s)]
*  Maybe they're going to post, we're eating dogs or cats, like in Ohio. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=61.04s)]
*  Forgive me if I'm wrong. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=65.84s)]
*  I don't trust these people. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  So that went great for the Republican Senate candidate in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=69.6s)]
*  Then there's Montana, where the Republican Senate candidate there is on tape repeatedly [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=73.2s)]
*  making really over-the-top, flagrantly racist derogatory remarks about Montana's Native [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=77.92s)]
*  Americans in a state where Native Americans make up fully 6% of the population. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=85.28s)]
*  Republican candidate Tim Sheehy first tried to claim that the recordings had somehow been [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=91.44s)]
*  deceptively edited before he was forced to admit that they are real and not at all deceptively [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=96.4s)]
*  edited. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=101.76s)]
*  He still refused to apologize for them, though. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=102.48s)]
*  There's also the kind of unbelievable ongoing lack of a resolution over that same Republican [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=105.36s)]
*  candidate, Tim Sheehy, saying a bullet in his arm was from him shooting himself accidentally [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=110.48s)]
*  when he dropped a gun in a national park. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=117.76s)]
*  But then he said the same gunshot wound was actually from him serving in Afghanistan. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  It can't be both. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=126.56s)]
*  He's refused to release any information that would clarify either way, even as the disputed [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=127.84s)]
*  gunshot wound has been a huge part of his campaign, which just seems completely untenable [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=133.76s)]
*  as we get closer to election day. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=138.56s)]
*  But yet here we are. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=140.0s)]
*  And oh wait, there's more. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=141.6s)]
*  If you were retiring from someplace cold like Michigan, you could do worse than this $1.6 [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  million estate in Cape Coral, Florida. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=149.92s)]
*  You can see it has beautiful views. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=153.6s)]
*  It has a very nice pool. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  This home is called an estate in its real estate listings. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=156.72s)]
*  It was purchased just two years ago in the summer of 2022. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=160.32s)]
*  It was purchased by Michigan Republican Congressman Mike Rogers. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=163.92s)]
*  He served seven terms in Congress. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=168.88s)]
*  He spent six years in the Michigan State Senate before that, all before he decided to pitch [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=170.48s)]
*  it all in and retire to Florida to live in his dream house. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, between D.C. and Michigan, I guess, I don't know if you can blame him for wanting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=179.28s)]
*  a taste of exceptional waterfront living in a much warmer location. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=183.2s)]
*  The problem is just six months after Mike Rogers bought his new dream home in Florida, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=191.04s)]
*  an even more prime piece of real estate opened up. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  Michigan Democratic U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow announced that she was retiring from the U.S. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=200.48s)]
*  Senate and this new Florida resident, Mike Rogers, he really wanted to run for that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=205.28s)]
*  Michigan U.S. Senate seat. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=209.84s)]
*  But unfortunately, that would mean he'd have to move back to Michigan. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=211.04s)]
*  Well, Mike Rogers decided he would buy this lovely little house in White Lake Township, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=214.72s)]
*  Michigan. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=223.52s)]
*  He bought it, then immediately knocked it down. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=224.72s)]
*  This photo was taken by local reporter John King of the Michigan Advance on April 30th. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=227.36s)]
*  It shows an empty plot of land where the house Mike Rogers bought used to be. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=231.84s)]
*  This picture, I think, redefines exceptional waterfront living. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=236.16s)]
*  Two months after this picture was taken, Mike Rogers registered to vote using that property [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=239.52s)]
*  as his home address. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=245.44s)]
*  Then one month after that, he voted for himself in the Republican primary for that U.S. Senate [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=247.28s)]
*  seat using that address as his voter registration location. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=253.52s)]
*  Now, all this is turning out to be a problem for U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=259.52s)]
*  According to the Detroit Free Press, the house that Mike Rogers is standing in is a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  house that Mike Rogers is still building on that spot isn't done. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=267.84s)]
*  It, quote, did not at the time he voted and does not now have a certificate of occupancy, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=272.88s)]
*  which means Mike Rogers could not legally live there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=279.11999999999995s)]
*  Quote, and if he didn't live there, he may have broken the law by using that address to vote. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  Joining me now is M.L. Elric. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  He's a Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter, currently a columnist for the Detroit [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  Free Press. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  He broke this story in his column this week. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  He's also the host of M.L.'s Soul of Detroit podcast. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=297.44s)]
*  Mr. Elric, thanks very much for being here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=302.08s)]
*  MR. ELRIC Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=303.68s)]
*  RACHEL BRENNAN Did I misunderstand any of that or did I pretty much get it the right way around? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=305.68s)]
*  MR. ELRIC No, I think the only misunderstanding and the Rogers campaign won't help us out with [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=309.76s)]
*  it is where does Mike Rogers actually lay his head? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=315.52s)]
*  Michigan's residency laws are very loose. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=319.04s)]
*  We're set up so that if you leave temporarily, if you go to college, if you become a veteran [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=321.68s)]
*  or you're serving overseas, you can vote at your old address. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=326.32s)]
*  The problem for Mike Rogers is we have no indication that he's ever actually lived at this address. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=329.68s)]
*  And while they say you can't go home again, if you're never there in the first place, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=334.96s)]
*  is it really your home? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=338.32s)]
*  RACHEL BRENNAN He previously had said that he was registered at his brother's [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=339.12s)]
*  home in Michigan. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=345.68s)]
*  And as I understand it from your reporting, you sort of spent some time hanging out around [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=346.96s)]
*  his brother's home asking neighbors, asking people who lived in the area if they had ever seen him. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=352.4s)]
*  It seems like, from your reporting at least, that his registration at his brother's home [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=358.08s)]
*  may also have been a bit of a ruse. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=362.79999999999995s)]
*  MR. ELRIC Yeah, I think anybody who's running for office, particularly in such a close race [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=364.4s)]
*  like this, doesn't spend a lot of nights at home. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=369.76s)]
*  We're a big state. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=371.76s)]
*  We have 83 counties and you want to get to all of them. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=372.64s)]
*  But you would think a former congressman who's living in your neighborhood will at least come [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=375.76s)]
*  by and say hi and say, can I get your vote? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=379.84s)]
*  The fact that his neighbors have not seen him is pretty surprising to me. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=382.4s)]
*  But the campaign assures us that at some point he really did stay there, which just means that he [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=388.24s)]
*  and his brother get along a lot better than me and my brother. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=393.68s)]
*  RACHEL BRENNAN Both them and their spouses in a house with one and a half bathrooms. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=395.92s)]
*  Let me ask you about one point. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=404.32s)]
*  I'm just going to read to you from your column on this matter. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=406.32s)]
*  There's still the question of whether Rogers committed a misdemeanor by using a home he could [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=409.36s)]
*  not occupy to register to vote, whether he committed a felony by voting in the August 6th primary, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=414.56s)]
*  and whether he can even legally vote for himself in the November 5th election. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=420.96000000000004s)]
*  You can't legally reside somewhere where there's no certificate of occupancy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=426.64s)]
*  If you don't legally reside somewhere, hard to say that you can register to vote there. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=430.16s)]
*  Are Democrats as political opponents, good government groups, watchdogs, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=435.2s)]
*  anybody pursuing this as a legal matter involving Mr. Rogers and potentially his ability to even [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=439.12s)]
*  vote for himself? The question of whether or not he might have broken the law by doing so in the past. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=445.2s)]
*  MICHAEL BESSERRA Yeah, we just broke this story on Sunday, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=448.88s)]
*  so I think the fallout is still kind of cascading through the Michigan political landscape. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  But frankly, given how Republicans are so worried about voter fraud and people voting illegally, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=458.56s)]
*  if anybody's going to raise a red flag on this, I would think it would be the Republican Party. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=463.76s)]
*  But then again, he is the Republican candidate, so maybe some other folks are going to say [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=468.0s)]
*  something. And unless he moves into that place before November 5th, there's always the chance [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  that when he goes to vote, somebody's going to say, excuse me, I'm challenging this gentleman's [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=481.12s)]
*  right to cast a ballot, presumably for himself. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=485.52s)]
*  Wow. ML Elric, columnist for the Detroit Free Press. Thank you for helping us understand this [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=488.79999999999995s)]
*  story. I appreciate your time. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwBUZ-v0T3c&t=493.76s)]
