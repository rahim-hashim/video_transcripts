# Ketanji Brown Jackson Invokes Constance Baker Motley As Confirmation Hearings Open
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po)
*  President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Constance Baker Motley to the federal judiciary in January [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=0.0s)]
*  1966. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=5.62s)]
*  By the end of that summer, she became the first black woman to serve on the federal [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  bench in the history of the United States. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=10.4s)]
*  But by that point, Judge Baker Motley had decades of experience litigating civil rights [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=12.66s)]
*  cases. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=18.14s)]
*  While working as the only woman lawyer at the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=19.14s)]
*  she was the protege of Thurgood Marshall, who of course went on to become the first [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=23.94s)]
*  black Supreme Court justice. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=28.02s)]
*  She wrote the original complaint in Brown v. Board of Education. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=30.02s)]
*  She represented clients like Martin Luther King Jr. after his arrest in Birmingham in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=33.54s)]
*  1963, and the more than 1,000 students who skipped class to protest segregation in Birmingham [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=38.1s)]
*  under the threat of police violence. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=44.06s)]
*  Motley was the first black woman to argue cases before the Supreme Court. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=46.54s)]
*  She did it 10 times. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=49.94s)]
*  She won nine of those 10 times. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=51.34s)]
*  And that is the story, legal legacy that President Biden's Supreme Court nominee, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=53.98s)]
*  Judge Katanji Brown Jackson, invoked today when she spoke to the Senate Judiciary Committee [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=58.36s)]
*  on day one of her confirmation hearings. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=63.12s)]
*  During this hearing, I hope that you will see how much I love our country and the Constitution [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=67.6s)]
*  and the rights that make us free. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=78.0s)]
*  I stand on the shoulders of so many who have come before me, including Judge Constance [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  Baker Motley, who was the first African American woman to be appointed to the federal bench [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=89.88s)]
*  and with whom I share a birthday. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=95.34s)]
*  And like Judge Motley, I have dedicated my career to ensuring that the words engraved [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=99.4s)]
*  on the front of the Supreme Court building, equal justice under law, are a reality and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=106.52s)]
*  not just an ideal. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=114.52s)]
*  Judge Katanji Brown Jackson, the first black woman nominated to the Supreme Court, spoke [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  to the committee for 10 minutes about her personal and professional background and her [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=124.16s)]
*  dedication to equal justice under the law. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=128.48s)]
*  She spoke only after several hours of remarks by committee members, which featured some [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=131.01999999999998s)]
*  prominent Republicans lobbing a range of critiques as she sat quietly listening. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=135.12s)]
*  There were complaints about her previous work as a public defender, her membership on a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=139.68s)]
*  school board, and the fact that President Biden did not choose a different black woman [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=143.24s)]
*  to be his nominee. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=147.44s)]
*  Other senators reminded the room that Judge Jackson had stood before the committee before. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=149.16s)]
*  She faced Senate confirmation hearings in 2009 for her nomination to the U.S. Sentencing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  Commission, in 2012 for her nomination to the federal district court in Washington, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=157.96s)]
*  again last April for her nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  She was confirmed each time, twice by voice vote and most recently by a nine vote margin [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=167.64s)]
*  with three Republicans supporting her nomination. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=173.12s)]
*  She also clerked for Justice Breyer, the justice who she seeks to replace. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=176.2s)]
*  With that extensive legal resume, she was able to make this assurance to the committee [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  today. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  On the day of his Supreme Court nomination, Justice Breyer said, quote, what is law supposed [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=186.2s)]
*  to do, seen as a whole? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  It is supposed to allow all people, all people to live together in a society where they have [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=198.92s)]
*  different views, so many different needs, to live together in a way that is more harmonious, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  that is better, so that they can work productively together. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=218.12s)]
*  If I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=225.92s)]
*  the Constitution and this grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=234.18s)]
*  these past 246 years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM0VrAzl6po&t=241.3s)]
