# 'Not well received': Hegseth, Vance embarrass themselves on international stage
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0)
*  Talk all we want about values. Values are important. But you can't shoot values. You [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=0.0s)]
*  can't shoot flags. And you can't shoot strong speeches. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=10.36s)]
*  You can't shoot with them? Or you can't shoot at them? You can't shoot with them? Are we [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=17.44s)]
*  sure he's not talking about shots? You know what I mean? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=27.08s)]
*  U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth at a meeting of the NATO defense ministers this [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=31.24s)]
*  week. I think that was supposed to sound tough. Came off a little more like something your [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=35.36s)]
*  least favorite uncle posts on Facebook next to a picture of an assault rifle and nine [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=38.68s)]
*  empty beer cans. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=43.28s)]
*  But Secretary Hegseth began this trip by bewildering not just our allies, but also a lot of people [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=45.72s)]
*  when he inexplicably blurted out that any peace deal in the Russia-Ukraine war would [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=53.12s)]
*  have to include Ukraine giving up its territory and abandoning its bid to join NATO. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  That would imply that the peace talks have already happened and Ukraine already had to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=66.12s)]
*  give everything up. Why would they talk? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=72.4s)]
*  We mentioned last night that Secretary Hegseth has now tried to walk those comments back. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=75.42s)]
*  But I think it is worth you hearing exactly how he started his remarks when he was trying [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=80.72000000000001s)]
*  to take back what he said the other day. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=86.92s)]
*  As it pertains to NATO membership not being realistic outcome for negotiations, that's [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=91.04s)]
*  something that was stated as part of my remarks here, as part of the coordination with how [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=96.48s)]
*  we're executing these ongoing negotiations. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  Can we say that again? Can we diagram that sentence? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=104.88s)]
*  That's something that was stated as part of my remarks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=108.88s)]
*  It's like he asked chat GPT to come up with the most passive voice way to say, you know [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=111.88s)]
*  what, I need to take back that dumb thing I said. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=117.88s)]
*  It's not just our allies abroad who reacted negatively to Pete Hegseth's comments. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=121.88s)]
*  After Hegseth made those comments, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=127.88s)]
*  Senator Roger Wicker responded by saying, quote, I'd prefer we don't give away negotiating [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=132.88s)]
*  positions before we actually get started. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=136.88s)]
*  After Hegseth then tried to take it back, walk back what he'd said and say he didn't [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=139.88s)]
*  really mean it, Senator Wicker then responded again, saying, quote, he made a rookie mistake. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=144.88s)]
*  I don't know who wrote the speech. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=149.88s)]
*  It's the kind of thing Tucker Carlson could have written. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=151.88s)]
*  And quote, Carlson is a fool, said the senator. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=154.88s)]
*  Again, that is a member of Pete Hegseth's own political party boldly criticizing his [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=159.88s)]
*  performance on this trip. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=164.88s)]
*  It's worth noting as Senator Wicker was making that unfavorable comparison to Mr. Carlson. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=166.88s)]
*  Mr. Carlson himself was posting a new interview with Hungary's authoritarian leader, Viktor [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=172.88s)]
*  Orbán, an interview where, as Politico puts it, quote, Orbán repeated Kremlin talking [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=178.88s)]
*  points that Russia invaded Ukraine in a bid to stop it from joining NATO. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=183.88s)]
*  Because, yes, Russia was on the ropes. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=188.88s)]
*  They were the real victim here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=191.88s)]
*  They just had to invade. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=193.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, today, Ukraine accused Russia's military of ramming a drone with a high explosive [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=195.88s)]
*  warhead on it into the former Chernobyl nuclear site. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=201.88s)]
*  The drone reportedly damaged the protective shield that is supposed to prevent radiation [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=205.88s)]
*  leaks from that famously radioactive site. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=210.88s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the damage was significant, but he says there [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=213.88s)]
*  are not currently signs of increased radiation. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=217.88s)]
*  And in all of this, the vice president of the United States managed to make things even [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=220.88s)]
*  more confusing, making his own sort of rookie moves on his own first trip abroad. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=225.88s)]
*  He told the Wall Street Journal that the U.S. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=230.88s)]
*  would potentially take military action in the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=232.88s)]
*  As in U.S. troops in Ukraine? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=236.88s)]
*  Everybody in this administration seems to be taking the approach that they should just [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=240.88s)]
*  say whatever pops into their head and try cleaning it up later. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=245.88s)]
*  Vice President Vance said that the Wall Street Journal had twisted his words. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=249.88s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal does not appear to have conceded they've done any such thing. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=253.88s)]
*  Joining us now from Munich, Germany, is former Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, who has [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=259.88s)]
*  stayed up till oh dark 30 to be with us tonight in the middle of the night. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=263.88s)]
*  Sir, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=267.88s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=268.88s)]
*  Always a pleasure to be on with you, Rachel. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=270.88s)]
*  These remarks from Pete Hegseth at the outset here speaking with NATO leaders were obviously [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=273.88s)]
*  not just damaging but embarrassing. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=281.88s)]
*  And he then tried to take them back. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=283.88s)]
*  We're in sort of a different situation with remarks that have since been made there by [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=285.88s)]
*  Vice President Vance. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=289.88s)]
*  I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about Vice President Vance's speech there [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=291.88s)]
*  and how it was received. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=295.88s)]
*  Well, first, it was just a rookie mistake is very generous. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=297.88s)]
*  I've negotiated with the Russians before. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=302.88s)]
*  They're tough negotiators. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=304.88s)]
*  And you don't just capitulate and give them what they want before you start the negotiations. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=305.88s)]
*  And the vice president could have clarified things today at the Munich Security Conference. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=310.88s)]
*  He could have devoted his speech to saying what the United States position is, what the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=314.88s)]
*  Trump administration official position is to try to clean it up. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=319.88s)]
*  But instead, he gave a speech about how democracy is failing in Europe. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=323.88s)]
*  He said that that was a bigger threat to Europe than Russia or China. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=328.88s)]
*  And he said that in a room filled with generals and admirals and Ukrainian soldiers. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=334.88s)]
*  And again, I don't need to tell you, Rachel, the irony of the vice president of the United [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=339.88s)]
*  States who works for President Trump telling the Europeans that they're doing a bad job [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=345.88s)]
*  at democracy, given what we are going through right now and given what we went through four [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=351.88s)]
*  years ago, really was quite insulting for this audience. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=355.88s)]
*  So it was just a it was a great opportunity to say clearly what their position was. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=359.88s)]
*  And instead, he chose to lecture them about democracy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=364.88s)]
*  I also understand that Vice President Vance made the decision in Germany at this meeting to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=368.88s)]
*  not meet with the German chancellor and instead to meet with the leaders of Germany's far [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=373.88s)]
*  right party, AFD, which is viewed by many Germans as the sort of unsettling inheritors of the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=380.88s)]
*  legacy of the Nazi party, frankly. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=389.88s)]
*  What do you make of this decision? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=392.88s)]
*  Is this a logistics decision or is this a loud message? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=394.88s)]
*  And if so, how is it being heard? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=396.88s)]
*  Definitely not a logistics decision. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=399.88s)]
*  The problem anybody that the vice president want to meet with, he could. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=402.88s)]
*  But it underscores the other message of his speech. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=406.88s)]
*  His speech was basically adopt our interpretation of values, right? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=409.88s)]
*  Mega values. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=414.88s)]
*  And again, these guys, there's a big contradiction. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=416.88s)]
*  They talk about sovereignty all the time. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=419.88s)]
*  But when it comes to German sovereignty, they're perfectly willing to get involved. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=421.88s)]
*  There's elections here in just a few days here in Germany. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=425.88s)]
*  And it was not well received. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=428.88s)]
*  I've been to this conference many, many times. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=430.88s)]
*  I cannot recall a speech that so many people were so insulted by. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=432.88s)]
*  Mike, the news out of Ukraine today, this video that we've seen of this drone with what appears to be a [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=437.88s)]
*  high explosive warhead on it smashing into the containment dome, sort of sarcophagus that covers the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=449.88s)]
*  highly radioactive Chernobyl nuclear disaster site. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=455.88s)]
*  Those images are so chilling and so unsettling. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=459.88s)]
*  Can I just ask your reaction to that? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=463.88s)]
*  Ukraine claims this is a Russian military drone. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=465.88s)]
*  Russia is essentially disclaiming responsibility for it. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=467.88s)]
*  How are you viewing this? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=470.88s)]
*  Well, Rachel, I spent most of my day today with Ukrainians, including soldiers. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=473.88s)]
*  They're fighting and they fought courageously for three years. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=479.88s)]
*  But when they hear our president say that he trusts Vladimir Putin and that he's going to do a deal with [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=483.88s)]
*  Vladimir Putin and then present it to the Ukrainian people and they experience what you are just showing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=488.88s)]
*  your viewers, there's a lot of dissonance there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=495.88s)]
*  They don't trust Putin. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=499.88s)]
*  Putin is their enemy. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=501.88s)]
*  And it makes them very nervous when the president of the United States, who they need and rely on to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=502.88s)]
*  continue to fight against the Russians, are saying he trusts Putin. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=508.88s)]
*  Former Ambassador to Russia Michael Mikhal joining us tonight live from Munich, where it is [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=514.88s)]
*  three fricking thirty in the morning. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=519.88s)]
*  Ambassador Mikhal, I now owe you at some point. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=522.88s)]
*  You can wake me up at three thirty in the morning for something. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=525.88s)]
*  I owe you at least a beer when you get back. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=527.88s)]
*  Thank you very much for being up at this at this time. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=530.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=532.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcVcc06Kn-0&t=544.88s)]
