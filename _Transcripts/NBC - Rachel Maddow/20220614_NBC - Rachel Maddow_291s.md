# Fascist Groups Best Understood As 'Nationwide Paramilitary Army': Expert
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM)
*  Police charging all 31 with conspiracy to riot, noting they planned to swarm several parts of Coeur d'Alene [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=0.0s)]
*  and carried paperwork similar to an operations plan that a police or military group would put together. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  They traveled in from states all across the country, allegedly united by white nationalism. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=12.64s)]
*  They appear to be affiliated with the group Patriot Front. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=17.92s)]
*  Why are white nationalists targeting a pride parade in Idaho or anywhere? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Historian Kathleen Ballew is the author of Bring the War Home, the white power movement in paramilitary America. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=28.08s)]
*  She's an expert on these kinds of movements. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=33.36s)]
*  Professor Ballew, thank you so much for making time for us tonight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=35.2s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=38.56s)]
*  So I've learned a lot of what I know about white power groups in this country and paramilitary movements in this country from your scholarship. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=40.0s)]
*  But I wanted to ask you about this impression that I have from recent news from the sedition and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  indictments for the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys for what we saw this weekend in Idaho. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=53.28s)]
*  I have this sense, this impression that these groups are now operating sort of as an adjunct, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=57.36s)]
*  a pretty close adjunct to what's happening in very right wing electoral politics. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=63.04s)]
*  They seem to be targeting the same targets, at least that are being singled out by right wing Republican politicians. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=67.68s)]
*  That feels unnerving to me. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=74.56s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you if that stands out to you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=75.92s)]
*  I think that's very concerning. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  And we don't know as much about that interface between mainstream politics and paramilitary white power activism and the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=81.12s)]
*  militant right as we do about the fringe of the movement. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=89.04s)]
*  But what we do know is that these groups are inherently opportunistic and they're prepared to use any open window to recruit and radicalize and foment violence. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=92.56s)]
*  And it's worth just mentioning that when we say the word white nationalists, sometimes people think that means overzealous patriotism. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=102.32s)]
*  But for these activists, the nation they envision is not the United States. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=109.44s)]
*  It's a transnational group of white people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=113.44s)]
*  It is a white ethnostate. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=116.32s)]
*  It is not the America defined by democracy and multiculturalism and multiracial identity. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=117.92s)]
*  That is the one that we live in. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=124.16s)]
*  It is a imaginary all white state. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=125.44s)]
*  So this is a very extremist movement. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  It's drawing in people, as you mentioned, from all over the country. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=130.32s)]
*  And the reason that we're seeing so many of these stories at the same time about Oath Keepers, Patriot Front, Proud Boys, the January 6th hearings, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=133.60000000000002s)]
*  all of these things are happening at the same time because this isn't a story about any one of these groups. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  This is a story about a groundswell. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=147.12s)]
*  And even though it appears as disconnected pods of activism, it's meant to do that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=149.44s)]
*  What it is is a nationwide paramilitary army that is prepared to do battle for its own purposes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=154.56s)]
*  Now, how much that can be wielded by the Republican Party, even on the very fringe, I think is open to question. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=161.28s)]
*  What do you make of the reports, including from NBC News, that after arresting these Patriot Front members in Idaho, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=168.56s)]
*  the actual police officers who arrested some of them, the police department, are getting doxed and are getting threatened? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=174.16s)]
*  Why are they threatening the police? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=179.6s)]
*  Yeah, you know, this has been kind of a push pull on social media because often there has been an issue with overlap [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=181.76s)]
*  between some of these groups and some people in law enforcement, and I would not paint that with one brush at all. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=188.8s)]
*  But, you know, Coeur d'Alene has a long history of dealing with these movements. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  Coeur d'Alene was the site of the Aryan Nations compound, which is an epicenter for this activity in the 1980s. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  It was nearby the the headquarter actions for Phineas Priesthood, which is a similar movement in the 90s. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  Folks up there are not new to this, and they're very aware of how violent it can become and how dramatically it can impact their community. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=213.11999999999998s)]
*  So I think, you know, one thing that stands out to me about the law enforcement response and is sort of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  emblematized in the doxing is that even structures of power are very much in the crosshairs of this kind of a movement. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=228.48s)]
*  There are other issues of people's homes being bombed in Coeur d'Alene, of people being run off the road, of people being harassed out of town. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=237.12s)]
*  It goes on and on like this. And, you know, bank robberies in nearby Spokane, Washington. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=245.44s)]
*  These activists and the movement they come from have done incalculable damage Coeur d'Alene over time. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=251.04s)]
*  Kathleen Ballew, the author of Bring the War Home, the White Power Movement and Paramilitary America, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=258.32s)]
*  which is an essential reference book for our times, I'm sorry. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  Professor Ballew, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yh1tArfQmM&t=267.12s)]
