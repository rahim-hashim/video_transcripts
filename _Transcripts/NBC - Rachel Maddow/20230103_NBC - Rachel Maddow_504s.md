# Weakness of McCarthy support already compromising GOP; threatens House functioning
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ)
*  This Congress did a ton of really practical stuff. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  It would be nice if we had a next Congress too. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=3.36s)]
*  And even if you don't have high expectations, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  what this next Congress is going to do, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=8.96s)]
*  given the leadership and how they're starting, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=10.68s)]
*  they are one of our branches of government, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=12.6s)]
*  one that we might technically need. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=14.5s)]
*  And this isn't the time to be giving any of them up. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  You might have seen this on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=20.76s)]
*  the editorial page of the New York Times today. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=22.68s)]
*  Headline here, a failed speaker vote for [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=25.6s)]
*  Coven McCarthy would be a historic event. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=28.26s)]
*  And this was written by a man who knows of which he speaks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=32.34s)]
*  His name is Brendan Buck. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=35.14s)]
*  He was an advisor to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=36.900000000000006s)]
*  the last two Republicans who served as speaker of the House. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=38.24s)]
*  He was an advisor to John Boehner and Paul Ryan. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Today he says this, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=43.300000000000004s)]
*  Opening day in the House of Representatives is typically [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  marked by the usual pageantry and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=47.5s)]
*  the fleeting promise that this Congress [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=49.06s)]
*  will work better than the last. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  That hope could be immediately dashed this year. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  If the House fails to elect a speaker on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=55.02s)]
*  the first ballot and descends into [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=56.94s)]
*  a floor fight unprecedented in modern times. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  A small band of Republican misfits has vowed to vote [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=61.5s)]
*  against Kevin McCarthy, the party's nominee for speaker. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=65.1s)]
*  With a razor thin majority, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=67.82s)]
*  just five Republicans voting against him [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=69.53999999999999s)]
*  could deny McCarthy the gavel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=71.74s)]
*  This would be no small event. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=73.68s)]
*  The House last failed to elect [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=75.82s)]
*  a speaker on the first ballot in 1923. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=77.78s)]
*  And it's only happened once since the Civil War. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=80.18s)]
*  Electing a speaker is a responsibility given [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=82.94s)]
*  the House by the Constitution. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=85.2s)]
*  Allowing the process to unravel into [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=87.48s)]
*  chaos would diminish the entire body. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=89.44s)]
*  McCarthy still has time to reach [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  an agreement with his critics and he should do [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=94.36s)]
*  all within reason to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=96.4s)]
*  secure the speakership on the first vote. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Otherwise, a self-serving power play by [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=99.92s)]
*  a small group of Republicans threatens to make [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=102.4s)]
*  a mockery of the institution and further cement [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=104.48s)]
*  the notion that the party is not prepared to lead. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  A failed vote would badly weaken [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=110.04s)]
*  McCarthy or whoever the new speaker will be. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=111.96s)]
*  This is an interesting point. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  The House is a majoritarian institution and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  a speaker's power is ultimately derived from [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  the ability to produce the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=121.96s)]
*  218 minimum votes needed to do business. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=123.0s)]
*  If Republicans are unable to muster the votes for a speaker, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=125.5s)]
*  it will make very clear from the outset that they cannot be [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=128.64s)]
*  counted on to fulfill the body's basic responsibilities, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=131.16s)]
*  such as funding the government and preventing [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=134.04s)]
*  a credit default by lifting the debt ceiling, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=136.0s)]
*  both of which will be required this year. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=138.0s)]
*  Should McCarthy come up short on the first ballot, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=140.44s)]
*  it could take several more votes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=143.0s)]
*  and days until we have a new speaker. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=144.88s)]
*  But no matter who emerges as the top House Republican, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=147.16s)]
*  the prolonged spectacle would leave [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=150.52s)]
*  the Republican majority hopelessly damaged from the start, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=152.92s)]
*  along with the institution of the House itself. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=156.38s)]
*  This would be damaging to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=160.32s)]
*  the institution of the House itself. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=161.72s)]
*  Joining us now is Brendan Buck. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=164.72s)]
*  He served as a senior advisor to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=166.8s)]
*  former Republican House speakers, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  John Boehner and Paul Ryan. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Buck, I really appreciate you [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=171.28s)]
*  making time to be here tonight. Thank you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  My pleasure. Thank you. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=174.24s)]
*  I feel like you're trying to raise the alarm here, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=176.08s)]
*  that this isn't just Washington drama, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  that there are consequences [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=182.68s)]
*  here beyond the personalities involved. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=185.08s)]
*  There's consequences here for Congress as an institution. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  I wanted to ask you here to talk about that tonight because I [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  feel like I haven't been that worried about Congress. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=192.44000000000003s)]
*  I think a lot of other people have been worried about [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  the resilience of our form of government writ large. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=198.04s)]
*  But I haven't been worried that Congress and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=201.0s)]
*  its ability to constitute itself and act in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=203.12s)]
*  normal terms has been at stake. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=205.56s)]
*  Why do you think that's at stake in this fight? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=208.0s)]
*  Well, I understand where you come from in that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=211.16s)]
*  You see headlines and it always seems to work itself out. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=214.48s)]
*  I think this is a situation where it may not work itself out, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=217.16s)]
*  at least not in the first couple of days. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=220.16s)]
*  Look, the Speaker of the House is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=222.56s)]
*  the second in line to the President. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=224.1s)]
*  Obviously, constituting a Congress is important. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=226.08s)]
*  They have some basic responsibilities, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=228.4s)]
*  but electing a Speaker is important. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=229.84s)]
*  Having a Speaker is important. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  As I said, there are a lot of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=233.6s)]
*  important things that they have to do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=235.12s)]
*  If Kevin McCarthy is not elected Speaker, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=236.96s)]
*  they're going to have to elect somebody else. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=239.52s)]
*  They might have to do that on the fly, completely unvetted. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=241.68s)]
*  Somebody who isn't even running for Speaker right now, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=244.76s)]
*  may end up being Speaker of the House in two days. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=246.88s)]
*  Someone you may not even be on your radar, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  could be Speaker of the House in two days. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=250.76s)]
*  That's a real reality that we're facing right now. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=252.76s)]
*  This, again, has not happened in a very long time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=255.28s)]
*  Nobody on the floor going into this process [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=257.56s)]
*  will have ever seen this before. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=259.48s)]
*  And so we'll have a bit of chaos. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=261.0s)]
*  It could be vote after vote. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  And ultimately, you don't know how it could play out. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=265.52s)]
*  And I think there's some serious, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=269.12s)]
*  serious consequences to that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=270.2s)]
*  It will show the American people [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  that the House is completely unprepared to lead. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=273.36s)]
*  As I said in the piece, 218 votes runs everything. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=276.88s)]
*  If you have 218 votes, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=279.76s)]
*  you can do just about anything in the House. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=280.88s)]
*  But if you don't have 218 votes, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=282.8s)]
*  you can't do much of anything. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=284.8s)]
*  And if Kevin McCarthy or whoever it may be, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=286.24s)]
*  starts off showing that they don't have 218 votes, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=288.8s)]
*  they don't have 218 people behind them, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=290.92s)]
*  he goes into a negotiation with Democrats, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=292.96s)]
*  he's dead from the beginning. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=295.2s)]
*  So his ability to get things done, I think, will be limited. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=297.36s)]
*  The House will again be a laughing stock. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  And it just does not set up Republicans very well [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=302.56s)]
*  for long-term success. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=304.44s)]
*  And I think it says a lot about how broken our politics are. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=305.48s)]
*  It's an interesting point that you raise about vetting. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=308.96s)]
*  I've been hearing a lot of interesting discussion, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  kind of discussed almost in sports terms, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=313.8s)]
*  about how the people who are against McCarthy, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=315.76s)]
*  or even if they're not against him, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=318.32s)]
*  they're kind of betting that he might not survive this. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=319.8s)]
*  They're keeping names out of the hat, effectively. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  They're not talking about who might be viable contenders. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=325.8s)]
*  There's nobody who's really standing up to run. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=329.2s)]
*  You yourself said in your piece today [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=331.52s)]
*  that you think Representative Andy Biggs [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=333.2s)]
*  has put his name forward essentially as a placeholder, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=335.04s)]
*  knowing that he'll never be speaker, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  but he's willing to put his name out there [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=338.92s)]
*  simply to be the person who represents the challenge. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=340.32s)]
*  But this is a further interesting point. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=343.08s)]
*  By nobody effectively running for it [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=345.36s)]
*  who has a real shot at it, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=347.48s)]
*  and this process starting anyway, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=349.0s)]
*  because of the constitutional imperative [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=350.84s)]
*  of the last Congress ending [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=352.72s)]
*  and us needing to start this thing, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=354.08s)]
*  we could end up with somebody being thrust [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=355.76s)]
*  into the very top levels of leadership [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=357.88s)]
*  around whom there hasn't been any more of debate [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=361.24s)]
*  outside their congressional district [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=364.88s)]
*  as to whether or not they're a member of Congress. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=366.52s)]
*  It might be somebody who's basically totally unknown [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=368.2s)]
*  and therefore totally unvetted at a national level. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=370.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think George Santos [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=373.56s)]
*  is gonna be the next speaker, but you're right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  It could be someone that is not at all on the radar [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=376.44s)]
*  and nobody that has had the vetting. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=378.96s)]
*  I think there are some really interesting [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  strategic decisions going on right now, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  and I have to give some credit [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=384.64s)]
*  to the Freedom Caucus members who are plotting here. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=385.68s)]
*  I think it's actually a good strategy for them [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=388.08s)]
*  to not put somebody out there. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=389.79999999999995s)]
*  It will be really hard for anybody to emerge, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=391.56s)]
*  particularly early on in this process, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  and openly say they are challenging Kevin McCarthy [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=396.32s)]
*  and actually beat him. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=398.88s)]
*  The reason for that is if Kevin McCarthy doesn't get it, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=400.52s)]
*  and I'm not saying that he won't, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=402.96s)]
*  he still has a very good chance of becoming speaker, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=404.4s)]
*  but if he doesn't, they still have to turn around [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=406.4s)]
*  and get 218 votes for somebody else. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=408.96s)]
*  Only four people can lose on that vote as well. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=412.2s)]
*  So if somebody comes, maybe a Steve Scalise, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=415.08s)]
*  who's in number two right now, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  says he's gonna challenge Kevin McCarthy, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=418.35999999999996s)]
*  that's gonna upset a lot of people, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=420.32s)]
*  a lot of McCarthy backers. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=421.55999999999995s)]
*  Whoever's the next speaker is probably gonna need [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy to vote for them if it's not Kevin McCarthy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=424.64s)]
*  So I think it's actually good politics for them [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=427.88s)]
*  to hold back, not put anybody up. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=429.8s)]
*  If Kevin McCarthy is not ultimately the speaker, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=432.04s)]
*  it's probably gonna have to come down to him [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=435.08s)]
*  at some point throwing in the towel, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  having enough votes and having enough embarrassment [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=439.0s)]
*  and saying, I just can't get there, I give up. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=441.64s)]
*  Because I don't think that anybody can outwardly [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=444.08s)]
*  challenge him or else they're gonna find the same trouble [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=445.64s)]
*  that they're in too, and that person may lose as well. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=447.96s)]
*  And the process, as you point out today, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=451.4s)]
*  whoever emerges, whether it's Mr. McCarthy or somebody else, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  this process will inherently weaken them [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=457.04s)]
*  to the point where the ongoing control of the Congress, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=461.44s)]
*  the ongoing control of the House [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=464.52s)]
*  in terms of what it's able to do, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=465.64s)]
*  will be in question from the very beginning. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=467.44s)]
*  As you said today, the embarrassment may be the point. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=469.08s)]
*  Brendan Buck, you have an invaluable perspective on this, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=472.44s)]
*  thanks to your experience working as a senior advisor [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=475.28s)]
*  to two previous Republican speakers of the House. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=477.72s)]
*  Thanks for joining us tonight, I appreciate your time. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=479.92s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate it, thank you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kug5lNDlgJQ&t=482.24s)]
