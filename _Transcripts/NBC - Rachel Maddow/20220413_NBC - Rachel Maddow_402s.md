# Russians Dare To Continue To Speak Out Against War Despite Kremlin Threat
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8)
*  Russian citizens inside Russia, where Putin has made it a criminal offense to criticize his war, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=0.0s)]
*  look what they're doing now. This is inside a Russian grocery store. You can see on the shelf [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  there that's instant coffee on the top shelf there, 400 rubles, means it's about five bucks for the jar. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=10.32s)]
*  But the description there does not say instant coffee. The description there says, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=15.84s)]
*  quote, the Russian army has bombed an art school in Mariupol. Around 400 people were inside it, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=19.92s)]
*  hiding from the shooting. That's what it says next to the price on that instant coffee. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=26.8s)]
*  Here's a display of picnic candy bars, again, in a Russian supermarket, 14 rubles. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=32.4s)]
*  And the description of that product, it says, Russian soldiers did not let 14 trucks with [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=38.64s)]
*  humanitarian cargo into the Khursan Oblast. Peaceful civilians there need food and medicine. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=43.92s)]
*  These replaced price tags in Russian supermarkets have started to turn up in the wild. We've started [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=50.32s)]
*  to see social media and reporters documenting them. But now we've got kind of a master list, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=58.24s)]
*  a grid of them that have reportedly been created by a Russian feminist anti-war group that was [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=64.56s)]
*  founded the day after Russia invaded Ukraine. Again, this is a homegrown group of Russians [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=70.4s)]
*  that are doing what they can to try to speak out against the war. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=77.91999999999999s)]
*  And as you see, there's a whole bunch of these. There's like 15 of these that they've made. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=82.0s)]
*  But you can see how under the radar they are, right? They look just like the kinds of price [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=86.32s)]
*  tags you'd see on supermarket shelves. You wouldn't notice unless you looked carefully. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=89.6s)]
*  But you look carefully and, I mean, look, we translated these. This one, the price tag's 20 [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=93.28s)]
*  rubles. And what's the item for sale there? It says, the Russian army has destroyed over 20 [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  medical establishments in Ukraine. Here's another one, price tag zero rubles. That might stand out [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=104.56s)]
*  to you. But then what's the description here? It says, people I know are hiding from Russian [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=110.72s)]
*  bombings in the metro. Zero of them are Nazis. Stop the war. Here's one that's listed at 4,300 [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  rubles. This is about, I think it's roughly about 50 bucks. It says, stop the war. In the first three [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=123.92s)]
*  days, 4,300 Russian soldiers died. Why is this not being talked about on TV? Here's another price tag [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=130.64s)]
*  80 rubles. The description here says, Russian war forces have destroyed 80 percent of the city of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=139.2s)]
*  Mariupol. What for? I'll show you one more. This one has a price tag eight rubles. It says, quote, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=144.64s)]
*  I haven't been in touch with my sister from Ukraine for eight days. I don't know what has happened to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=152.88s)]
*  her. Stop the war. The group that put these out, implicitly encouraging Russians to print them out [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=157.68s)]
*  and put them up on supermarket shelves in that country, the group that put this out set on their [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=166.72s)]
*  telegram channel by replacing something very routine with something alien and unnatural. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=172.8s)]
*  We show that there is not a single place in our country that will not be affected by the war. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  We do not let people simply close their eyes to what is happening. Again, these are Russians. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=182.96s)]
*  These are Russian citizens inside Russia now illegally trying to get this word out, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=188.8s)]
*  illegally trying to sneak their stated opposition to Putin and his war into some place, some place [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  in civil society, some place in everyday life where other Russians might see it and might know [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  that other people are against the war too. And they're being arrested for it. Yesterday, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=207.04s)]
*  a man was arrested for replacing price tags in a supermarket, reportedly with little homemade [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=213.12s)]
*  signs that said no to war. He is facing 10 years in prison, according to the local press. Today, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=218.56s)]
*  a young woman in St. Petersburg, an artist, was ordered held in prison until June. That's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=225.44s)]
*  pre-trial detention before she'll go on trial to face 10 or potentially even 15 years in prison [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=232.56s)]
*  for allegedly putting notes on price tags and a St. Petersburg supermarket notes [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=239.52s)]
*  in her case that allegedly described what Russia has bombed in Mariupol. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=244.4s)]
*  Remarkably, we have this photo of some of her friends turning up at the police station [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=250.08s)]
*  to bring her her things and to try to support her. I think they hope that this woman would be [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  released after her closed-door court hearing today. But, you know, honestly, if your friend [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=259.52s)]
*  is facing a decade in prison specifically for putting a note on a price tag, a note containing [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  true information, it takes some bravery for you to even show up at the police station to support [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  your friend for having done that. But look, these people did it. And this was her being brought out [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  of that closed-door court hearing today before they did take her off to jail. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=282.32s)]
*  Oh, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=289.52s)]
*  and then they take her away. But it's remarkable that Russians were willing to show up at the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=308.79999999999995s)]
*  police station to show their support for her, to applaud for her, given the threat to them [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=315.04s)]
*  for being seen to support someone who said something true about Putin's war. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=321.04s)]
*  Credit to the Wall Street Journal's reporters in Russia for their reporting on that and credit to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  Amnesty International as well for staying on the case of this young woman who is now looking at a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  decade or potentially 15 years in prison, again, for putting true information next to a price tag [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  in a Russian supermarket. Because what else can you do? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=341.6s)]
*  What is going to stop Putin from grinding away at Ukraine in this war for more days, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=348.08s)]
*  more weeks, maybe more months? What's going to stop him from killing thousands more, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=354.56s)]
*  10,000s more civilians? We don't know. But we do know that some Russians are trying. It is illegal [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=359.04s)]
*  for them to speak against the war. It's illegal for the Russian media to even describe it as a war. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=368.48s)]
*  But Russians are still trying and they're being arrested for it. But they're still trying. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=373.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDCjGZqQM8&t=398.48s)]
