# Prosecutor Exposes Another Facet Of Trump Scheme To Seize Voting Machines After 2020 Loss
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g)
*  Last week, Rachel reported that in addition to all these efforts to get federal agencies [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=0.0s)]
*  to seize voting machines, when President Trump invited delegations of Republican state lawmakers [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=4.84s)]
*  from Michigan and Pennsylvania to the White House a couple of weeks after the election, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=9.96s)]
*  he also talked to them about seizing the voting machines in their states. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=14.780000000000001s)]
*  That's according to new reporting from the New York Times. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=20.28s)]
*  And on November 20th, the very same day Trump was meeting with Republicans at the White [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=23.72s)]
*  House from Michigan, a lawyer for a Michigan county sheriff emailed a Trump lawyer claiming [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=27.92s)]
*  that his local sheriff, this local sheriff, had seized voting machines and ballots. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=35.2s)]
*  The sheriff, by the way, denied to us that he had actually done it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  So now that we know that right on or around that same day, November 20, 2020, Rudy Giuliani [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=43.84s)]
*  asked the local prosecutor in Antrim County, Michigan, to please seize the voting machines [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=50.86s)]
*  for the Trump campaign. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=55.6s)]
*  Now from the Washington Post today, quote, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=58.04s)]
*  In the weeks after the 2020 election, Rudolph W. Giuliani and other legal advisors to President [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=59.64s)]
*  Donald Trump asked a Republican prosecutor in northern Michigan to get his county's [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=65.0s)]
*  voting machines and pass them to Trump's team. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=71.88s)]
*  Antrim County prosecutor James Rossiter said in an interview that Giuliani and several [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=77.12s)]
*  colleagues made the request during a telephone call. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=82.08s)]
*  Rossiter said he declined. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=86.12s)]
*  I said, I can't just give them, say, give them here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=87.12s)]
*  We don't have that magical power to just demand things as prosecutors. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=91.48s)]
*  You need probable cause. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  Even if he had sufficient grounds to take the machines as evidence, Rossiter said he [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=97.72s)]
*  could not have released them to outsiders or a party with an interest in the matter. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=101.24s)]
*  A legal scholar said it was unusual and inappropriate for a president's representatives to make [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=107.52s)]
*  such a request of a local prosecutor. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=113.24s)]
*  I never expected in my life I'd get a call like this, Rossiter said. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  Trump and his allies tried to get the Pentagon to seize the machines. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=123.8s)]
*  Then they tried to get the Justice Department. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=127.92s)]
*  They tried Homeland Security. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=130.0s)]
*  They tried state lawmakers. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=131.7s)]
*  They tried a local prosecutor. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=133.48s)]
*  They never got anyone to say yes, but they really, really did try to make it happen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByIY36sE1g&t=136.32s)]
