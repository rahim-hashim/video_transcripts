# 'Pissed off at cowards and profiteers': Outrage grows over gun safety inaction
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4)
*  After the shooting in Nashville today, Nicole Hockley said this online. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=0.0s)]
*  She said, quote, we have the solutions, yet we mostly don't use them. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=6.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=10.0s)]
*  Because too many people love guns more than children and fight against solid measures, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=11.0s)]
*  praying for the families pissed off at cowards and profiteers. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=15.6s)]
*  Joining us now is Nicole Hockley. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=21.44s)]
*  She's co-founder and CEO of Sandy Hook Promise. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=22.64s)]
*  Ms. Hockley, it is nice to see you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=25.28s)]
*  I'm sorry that it's under terrible circumstances. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=27.88s)]
*  Thank you for taking time to be with us tonight. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=29.78s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=32.46s)]
*  It's always good to speak to you, but always under awful situations. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=33.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=37.54s)]
*  Let me ask you to expound a little bit on what you said today in the immediate aftermath [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=38.54s)]
*  of this news. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  You said we have solutions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  We don't usually, we mostly don't use them. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=45.7s)]
*  You said you were, you know, praying for these families, but you said you're angry. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=48.42s)]
*  You said you're pissed off at the cowards and profiteers. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=52.14s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=54.46s)]
*  Exactly that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=57.42s)]
*  I am so heartbroken and continue to be heartbroken every single day. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=60.06s)]
*  There have been so many incidences of gun violence, so many incidents of school shootings. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  My heart just can't take it anymore. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=70.06s)]
*  And now I'm just really pissed off. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=71.9s)]
*  There are too many people that just want to debate about this and want to talk about why [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=75.38s)]
*  we shouldn't talk about it now or that now isn't the time or that we need to protect [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=80.42s)]
*  gun owners first. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  I honestly think that the majority of gun owners want to see these solutions too. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=87.62s)]
*  They probably purchase their guns to protect their families. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=92.53999999999999s)]
*  They don't want gun violence. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=95.82s)]
*  They don't want school shootings. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  And neither does anyone else. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=99.86s)]
*  So why don't we take the solutions that are on the plate right now, such as safe storage, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=101.14s)]
*  such as background checks, such as magazine limits or even assault weapons bans and do [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=106.02s)]
*  something about it rather than this constant endless cycle of conversation that actually [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=111.06s)]
*  doesn't go anywhere when we know these solutions work and we know it's what people want. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=117.14s)]
*  Those practical measures that you just described, I'm thinking particularly the first three [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=123.06s)]
*  before the assault weapons ban, safe storage, background checks, magazine limits, the public [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=127.22s)]
*  opinion polling on that shows that not only do Americans want those things and support [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=133.5s)]
*  those kinds of practical solutions in overwhelming numbers, most gun owners do too. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=138.1s)]
*  And that's been true for a long time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=144.54s)]
*  And so I guess I'm wondering as somebody who's been working on this again in very practical [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=146.14000000000001s)]
*  ways, do you see any distance closing between the views of Americans, including gun owners [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=149.54s)]
*  and the advocacy groups and the politicians who won't allow for practical solutions like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=155.86s)]
*  those? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=160.74s)]
*  I think the distance is closing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=162.58s)]
*  And we saw a big gap in that decrease last year with the passage of the Bipartisan Safer [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=164.73999999999998s)]
*  Communities Act, where we saw that Congress could come together from both sides and agree [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=169.61999999999998s)]
*  on a set of common sense legislation that would prevent violence and in particular gun [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=175.33999999999997s)]
*  violence. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=179.94s)]
*  However, it's not enough. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=180.94s)]
*  We know there's still much more we need to do. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=182.62s)]
*  My organization continues to focus on teaching the signs. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=185.17999999999998s)]
*  How do you recognize someone who is going into crisis or who is in danger of hurting [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=188.26s)]
*  themselves or someone else and taking action? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=192.54s)]
*  But we also need the legislation to support and enforce that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=194.98s)]
*  And I still think there are far too many politicians in particular that are focused on their careers [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=198.26s)]
*  more than about being on the right side of history and doing the right things by kids. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=206.94s)]
*  That needs to change. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=211.89999999999998s)]
*  And also there is still a gun industry that is more focused on profits and measures. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  We still hear them talk about more people need guns. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  That's the way to prevent bad people with guns. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=223.06s)]
*  That's the way to prevent criminals. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=226.14000000000001s)]
*  Not every shooter is a criminal. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=227.86s)]
*  They don't start that way. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=229.54000000000002s)]
*  They start as a normal person and through a series of circumstances, it escalates into [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=231.3s)]
*  violence. The difference is they have access to firearms. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  So if we are better about how we ensure is someone capable of having a firearm, are they [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  mentally able to have that firearm? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=246.9s)]
*  Are they in crisis or not? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=248.98s)]
*  And stop thinking about money. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=250.82s)]
*  Stop thinking about careers. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=252.61999999999998s)]
*  Think about your children. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=254.1s)]
*  How do you want their school experience to be? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=256.02s)]
*  Do you want them to come home every single day? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=258.42s)]
*  If you don't care, then continue on the path you are. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=261.18s)]
*  If you care at all, then you need to do something about it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=263.9s)]
*  Nicole Hockley, the co-founder and CEO of Sandy Hook Promise, who knows of what she speaks. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, thank you so much for taking time to be here tonight, Nicole. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=274.38s)]
*  It is always good to see you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=277.86s)]
*  I swear you'll be back here on Happier Time soon. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=279.82s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT5Bzz--3m4&t=282.66s)]
