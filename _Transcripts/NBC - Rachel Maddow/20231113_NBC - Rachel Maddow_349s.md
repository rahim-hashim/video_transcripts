# Why the Supreme Court's new toothless code of ethics matters 'a little bit'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0)
*  Quote, the absence of a code has led in recent years to the misunderstanding that the justices [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=0.0s)]
*  of this court, unlike all the other jurists in this country, regard themselves as unrestricted [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=6.04s)]
*  by any ethics rules. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=11.14s)]
*  To dispel this misunderstanding, we are issuing this code. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=12.84s)]
*  See, they're only doing it to dispel this misunderstanding about how closely they have [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=16.72s)]
*  been following the ethics rules. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=22.52s)]
*  See, paying off a Supreme Court justice with like an RV or buying his mom a house or the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=25.12s)]
*  private jet and yacht trips. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=31.32s)]
*  That was all a misunderstanding by us, the American public, about just how ethical that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=33.46s)]
*  really is. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=39.06s)]
*  Or something. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  Joining us now is Dahlia Lithwick. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  She's legal correspondent and senior editor at Slate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=43.84s)]
*  She's also the author of Lady Justice, Women, the Law, and the Battle to Save America. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=45.92s)]
*  Dahlia, my friend, it's great to see you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=50.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=52.88s)]
*  Good to see you, Rachel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  How do you see this news that the Supreme Court has for the first time issued an ethics [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=56.96s)]
*  note, an ethics advisory that is apparently for us, but maybe not for them? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=61.08s)]
*  I like to think of it as an ethics aspiration. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=67.2s)]
*  Like it's a little wish casting. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  It's the court saying, it's not us, it's you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=76.44s)]
*  You misunderstood our ethics rules. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=81.36s)]
*  And so let us explain again these law-abiding ethics rules that we have not abided by. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=83.84s)]
*  But if we explain them again, you'll understand. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  Listen, you're right to be cynical, Rachel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  And I think I want to say something in the vein of what you and Michael Beschloss were [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=95.44s)]
*  just talking about, which is it feels like it's a joke that this is how institutions [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  police themselves. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=108.72000000000001s)]
*  But it matters a little bit that the Supreme Court, for the first time in history, responds [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=110.2s)]
*  to an American public that demands that it police itself. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  And so I'm not happy about these rules, which are purely advisory, which everyone is going [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  to tell you has no enforcement mechanism that feels like more of the justice gaslighting [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=127.28s)]
*  us and telling us that we misunderstood the ethics rules all along. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  It matters a little bit to me that Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett and Kagan and the Chief [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=139.68s)]
*  Justice think this is important enough to do right now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=145.56s)]
*  And so I want to be as grumpy as you are, because these are not real rules. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=151.0s)]
*  But I also want to signal that I think as far as institutions policing themselves go, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=157.6s)]
*  the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court, for the first time in history, takes note of American [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=164.78s)]
*  public fury at its ethics violations matters a tiny bit. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=170.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=174.9s)]
*  The responsiveness itself is an important part of the story here in them recognizing [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=175.9s)]
*  that their legitimacy does depend on us believing that they have legitimacy and that our opinion [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  as a public matters. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=188.38s)]
*  I take your point on that on on the specifics of what they put in print today is did they [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=189.94s)]
*  clarify their ethical rules in any way that would make a difference in any of the high [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  level headline scandals that we've seen that really do seem just like plain corruption [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=206.14s)]
*  and bribery scandals among a number of these judges? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=210.66s)]
*  No, it's the very opposite of that, Rachel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  This is to the extent that courts are meant to promulgate rules that either mean something [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=217.34s)]
*  looking backward or going forward. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=222.3s)]
*  This does neither. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=224.46s)]
*  Looking backward seems to exculpate the worst behavior we've seen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=225.9s)]
*  And going forward, this isn't a pledge or a promise. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=231.9s)]
*  This isn't binding, as everybody has said. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=234.78s)]
*  There's no mechanism by which to investigate or enforce these rules. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=237.9s)]
*  So this is really like it's a hallmark card from the court to us saying like, trust us [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  this time, we're really going to adhere to these rules that we promise we've been here [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=247.02s)]
*  to all along. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=251.86s)]
*  Nothing about this should make us feel good about going forward. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=252.86s)]
*  Justices committing to something because they will all decide for themselves. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=257.86s)]
*  So no, this isn't a code of ethics that can be cast in amber to mean something. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=263.18s)]
*  I think it signals a court that wants to be in some kind of conversation. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=270.3s)]
*  It's a generous word. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=275.82s)]
*  Let's call it a sermon on the mount. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=277.5s)]
*  But I think an attempt to say, holy cow, our popularity ratings are plummeting. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=279.58s)]
*  Our behavior has been appalling. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=287.9s)]
*  People get that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=290.58s)]
*  They don't think there should be a scenario in which multi-billionaires are determining [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  what cases come before the court and how those cases are decided. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=298.9s)]
*  They get that now. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=302.82s)]
*  And I think that the fact that Justices Thomas and Alito don't fully sign on to changing [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=304.18s)]
*  their conduct isn't the end game here. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=309.82s)]
*  The end game is a court that feels that it has to answer to us. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=312.06s)]
*  And I think that matters a little bit. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=315.7s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  And I think that's right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  Dolly Lithwick, that's the kind of conversation that I really always enjoy having with you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  You always teach me something. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=324.62s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here tonight. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=325.94s)]
*  Back at you, Rachel. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=328.41999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hczi-EmkTn0&t=334.14s)]
