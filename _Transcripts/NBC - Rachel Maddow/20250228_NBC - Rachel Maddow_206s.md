**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw)
*  I want to tell you and your people, you're the ally I've been hoping for all my life. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=0.0s)]
*  Not one American has died defending Ukraine. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=6.48s)]
*  You've taken our weapons and you've kicked their ass. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=9.92s)]
*  And I'm very proud to have you as our ally. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  The Russians are the bad guys. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=15.92s)]
*  They invaded, contrary to almost every international law, and they should be defeated. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=17.84s)]
*  And Ukraine is entitled to the promises that the world made to them. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=25.48s)]
*  Republican U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham and Roger Wicker praising Ukraine and Ukrainian [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  President Volodymyr Zelensky condemning Russia, saying Ukraine is an ideal ally, that they [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=38.88s)]
*  are entitled to the promises the world made them. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=45.8s)]
*  Those were not clips from two or three years ago. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=49.08s)]
*  Senator Graham and Senator Wicker said those things exactly two weeks ago. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=52.92s)]
*  That said, to be fair, we are in a news environment where two weeks can feel like an eternity. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=58.68s)]
*  So how about something not even two weeks ago? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=62.68s)]
*  How about something even more recent? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=64.53999999999999s)]
*  How about something from this morning? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=66.64s)]
*  Here's those same two senators greeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and sitting down [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=69.8s)]
*  with him for a meeting ahead of his trip to the White House today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=74.08s)]
*  You can hear Senator Wicker, the chair of the Armed Services Committee. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=76.76s)]
*  You can hear him in this next clip. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=80.32s)]
*  Delighted that you're here in the United States. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=81.91999999999999s)]
*  We're encouraged about the show of support. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  We have committee chairs. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=90.28s)]
*  We have the president. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=91.28s)]
*  But we're here today as a show of support. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=92.28s)]
*  We're here today as a show of support. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=97.44s)]
*  We are so encouraged you are here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=99.56s)]
*  We are delighted that I mention the show of support. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  After that meeting, Senator Lindsey Graham posted his own video about how excited he [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=107.08s)]
*  was to be supporting Ukraine today. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=111.24s)]
*  They were all so excited today. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=113.56s)]
*  Senator Wicker posted this picture of himself proudly shaking hands with President Zelensky, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=117.48s)]
*  calling the meeting a huge step forward in securing mutual prosperity and peace for Americans [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=121.72s)]
*  and Ukrainians. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=127.72s)]
*  This was today. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=129.24s)]
*  And you know what happened next. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=131.36s)]
*  Donald Trump and J.D. Vance screaming at President Zelensky in the Oval Office, hammering [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=134.24s)]
*  him with Russian talking points as the cameras rolled and rolled and rolled and rolled. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=139.12s)]
*  After that display, Senator Graham, who again, just this morning was so excited to show his [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=144.64s)]
*  support for Ukraine and President Zelensky, just hours after that, he called a press conference [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=151.68s)]
*  to demand that Volodymyr Zelensky must resign. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=157.0s)]
*  Senator Wicker, profile in courage, appears to have just quietly deleted his post from [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=162.0s)]
*  this morning, praising Volodymyr Zelensky and showing himself shaking his hand. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=168.64s)]
*  Courage, Senator Wicker. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=176.32s)]
*  We reached out to Senator Wicker's office tonight to ask what happened there. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=178.4s)]
*  Haven't heard back. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Lz35xtEXVw&t=182.28s)]
