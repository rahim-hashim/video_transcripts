# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 29
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A)
*  So, January 22, there's speculation that he is facing potential criminal charges. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=0.0s)]
*  So, he says, in January 22, quote, I hope we are going to have in this country the biggest [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=6.0s)]
*  protests we have ever had. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=10.88s)]
*  Then, a few months later, that fall, he said, if he was indicted, the United States would [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=13.6s)]
*  face, quote, problems, the likes of which perhaps we've never seen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=19.6s)]
*  In March 2023, he's indeed preparing to be indicted in New York, and he just sounds the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=25.28s)]
*  clarion call. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=30.340000000000003s)]
*  This is it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=31.42s)]
*  All capital letters. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=32.42s)]
*  He says, quote, protests take our nation back. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=33.42s)]
*  It's time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=36.2s)]
*  We just can't allow this anymore. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  We must save America. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=39.2s)]
*  Protest, protest, protest. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  He says it three times with three exclamation points. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  When Trump was indeed then indicted, when he was indeed then arraigned, these were all [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=46.84s)]
*  the people who came out to protest, protest, protest in favor of him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=51.6s)]
*  This was the biggest crowd he's had from any of these things. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=56.36s)]
*  This was it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=59.260000000000005s)]
*  Probably not enough to take the country back, certainly not with three exclamation points. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=60.260000000000005s)]
*  But that was the biggest he ever got. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=64.44s)]
*  Two months later, another indictment, this time in the classified documents case in Florida. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  Again, he demanded that his supporters rally for him in person. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=71.88s)]
*  Quote, all caps. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=76.2s)]
*  See you in Miami on Tuesday. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=77.68s)]
*  Local law enforcement prepared for crowd prepared for crowds of up to 50,000 people after he [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=79.96s)]
*  said that the actual crowd was closer to 500 people, not 50,000 people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=84.63999999999999s)]
*  Then last week, ahead of opening statements in his New York criminal trial, Trump tried [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=92.32s)]
*  cranking the handle again. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=96.91999999999999s)]
*  Seventy two hours until all hell breaks loose. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  If we fail to have a massive outpouring of peaceful patriotic support right here, right [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  now, all hell will break loose. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=104.8s)]
*  All hell did not break loose. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=107.52s)]
*  It was Rudy Giuliani's adult son and a smattering of other people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=108.6s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=114.08s)]
*  Trump has actually tried claiming that big throngs of people have been showing up to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=116.8s)]
*  protest and show their support for him in New York, or at least that people have showed [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  up trying to protest. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=127.16s)]
*  But he says police have been keeping them away. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=128.16s)]
*  He's tried claiming on social media that the area outside the court was, quote, completely [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  closed down. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=135.64s)]
*  He said, quote, thousands of people were turned away from the courthouse in lower Manhattan [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=137.6s)]
*  by steel stanchions and police. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=141.28s)]
*  And again, it's just not true. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=145.64s)]
*  People are not police are not turning people away. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=148.0s)]
*  There are no steel stanchions that are blocking his supporters from turning up and walking [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  around them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=156.2s)]
*  I mean, you can you can walk right up there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=157.2s)]
*  But by by Thursday, the third day of testimony in the trial this past week, it was just this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  one dude named Gary. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=165.72s)]
*  And that was kind of it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=167.8s)]
*  And so because he has not just been predicting protests on his behalf, he has been commanding [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  his followers to protest for him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  It is a little humiliating for Trump that this is happening, that he can't seem to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  summon a crowd. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=185.36s)]
*  It's also just an interesting data point, broadly speaking, as to whether or not Trump [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=186.36s)]
*  can command an angry mob at this point in his political trajectory. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=189.60000000000002s)]
*  Or are those days behind him? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=193.56s)]
*  I think the other way that this functions, though, is that it's an important reminder [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  that he's not getting what he wants in terms of daily stimulation, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=200.48s)]
*  He's not getting crowds of people lining the streets or standing outside the courtroom [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=205.0s)]
*  chanting for him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=208.8s)]
*  Nobody's out there for him. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=210.88s)]
*  The courtroom where his trial is taking place is old and dingy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=213.16s)]
*  It kind of smells weird. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=217.16s)]
*  And so starting tomorrow, he's heading into another week of long, detailed testimony. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=219.1s)]
*  We can expect that he will be disappointed, angry and perhaps delusional about the reasons [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=225.22s)]
*  that there are not people outside protesting for him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=229.78s)]
*  Inside the trial, if passed as prologue, he's likely to be bored and unhappy while not receiving [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=232.9s)]
*  the kind of response and adoration from the people he expects to deliver that to him. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=238.26s)]
*  Maggie Haberman at the New York Times recently put it this way. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=244.18s)]
*  She said, quote, It is hard to recall any other time Trump has been forced to be bored [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=247.34s)]
*  for so long. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=253.06s)]
*  Quote, the shared sense among many of his advisers is that the process may damage him [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=254.06s)]
*  as much as a guilty verdict. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=259.06s)]
*  The process, they believe, is its own punishment. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=260.54s)]
*  If the process is the punishment here, what should we expect from what these next few [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=264.98s)]
*  days are likely to be like with likely no more protesters and testimony that we can [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=269.38s)]
*  sort of see coming around the corner that seems like it might be more boring than anything [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=275.02s)]
*  that's yet happened. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=278.94s)]
*  How much worse is this about to get for him? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  And can he pull the ripcord to get out of it? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=283.26s)]
*  This is a live dynamic right now in the Republican Party in way more places than you would think. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=287.58s)]
*  Here, for example, is the AP headline on the Republicans U.S. Senate candidate in Pennsylvania. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=293.34s)]
*  David McCormick is gearing up for a Senate run in Pennsylvania, but he lives in Connecticut. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=299.22s)]
*  That seems bad. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=304.06s)]
*  I mean, if you think about a Pennsylvania Senate race, right, you will recall it wasn't [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=307.54s)]
*  that long ago that Republicans lost a shot at a winnable U.S. Senate seat. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=311.38s)]
*  Last time around, last election cycle when they ran Republican candidate Mehmet Oz, right? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=316.62s)]
*  Republicans ran Mehmet Oz, Dr. Oz, for that seat in Pennsylvania, and Democrats needled [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=323.78s)]
*  him relentlessly about the fact that he kind of lived in New Jersey. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=328.46s)]
*  And so what's he doing running in Pennsylvania? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=332.1s)]
*  Well, now the Republicans are going to try again in Pennsylvania, except this time they're [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=333.98s)]
*  running a guy who lives in Connecticut. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=337.58000000000004s)]
*  To try to maybe head off the same thing happening again, like what happened with Dr. Mehmet [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=342.74s)]
*  Oz, they have developed a backstory for their candidate this time around who lives in Connecticut. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=346.98s)]
*  They've decided that he's going to describe himself as someone who started with nothing, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=352.42s)]
*  who grew up on a family farm in Pennsylvania. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=357.58000000000004s)]
*  Did he start with nothing? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=361.98s)]
*  Did he grow up on a family farm in Pennsylvania? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=363.3s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=365.42s)]
*  Quote, Mr. McCormick has explicitly said that he grew up on a farm. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=366.42s)]
*  He claimed that he had, quote, started with nothing and that he, quote, didn't have anything. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=371.82s)]
*  He and his campaign have recently described his parents as school teachers. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=377.42s)]
*  In fact, Mr. McCormick is the son of a well-regarded college president who later became chancellor [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=381.82s)]
*  of higher education systems in Pennsylvania and in Minnesota. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=387.8s)]
*  David McCormick largely grew up at what is now Bloomsburg University in the president's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=391.9s)]
*  sprawling hilltop residence, which students called the president's mansion. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=396.94s)]
*  Or he started with nothing and grew up on a family farm. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=403.7s)]
*  So in Wisconsin, Republicans are running a Selena Meyer understudy who is from California, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=409.02s)]
*  whose bank is being sued for elder abuse and who says don't let people in nursing homes [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=414.9s)]
*  vote. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=418.62s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, Republicans are running a guy who lives in Connecticut who grew up in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=419.94s)]
*  a literal president's mansion and says it was a family farm where he was so poor. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=422.82s)]
*  But wait, there's more. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=427.82s)]
*  In Montana, Republicans really, really, really want to take the U.S. Senate seat there that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=428.82s)]
*  is currently held by popular Democratic Senator John Tester. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=433.54s)]
*  One of the things that makes John Tester really popular in a largely rural state like Montana [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=437.18s)]
*  is that Senator Tester is, for real, a real farmer, drives the tractor and everything. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=441.86s)]
*  Republicans have decided to run someone against Senator John Tester in Montana who is a person [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=447.62s)]
*  from Minnesota who grew up in the suburbs of St. Paul. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=452.98s)]
*  Since he has been running against John Tester, though, he has made a big deal of saying that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=458.06s)]
*  he grew up near farmland. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=462.06s)]
*  Turns out there was maybe farmland near the multimillion dollar lake house he grew up [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=467.14s)]
*  in in suburban St. Paul. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=472.86s)]
*  So that's pretty much just like being a farmer. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=474.9s)]
*  This follows another quite unusual controversy for this Montana Senate candidate in which [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=479.26s)]
*  he either dropped a loaded gun in a parking lot at Glacier National Park and the gun went [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  off when it hit the ground and he thereby shot himself in the arm, or he didn't really [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=490.53999999999996s)]
*  shoot himself in the arm by dropping a gun in the parking lot at Glacier National Park, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=495.82s)]
*  but he nevertheless went to the hospital anyway and while he did tell a U.S. park ranger [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=500.18s)]
*  that he dropped a gun in that parking lot and shot himself that day, he was actually [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=505.98s)]
*  lying about that to the ranger because really he was trying to conceal the secret truth [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=509.66s)]
*  that he had an unreported war wound that he didn't want anybody to know about. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=514.14s)]
*  But whatever happened, it was definitely near farmland. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=521.42s)]
*  You could smell it nearby in the vicinity. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=526.38s)]
*  Can I tell you, there's another one. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=529.58s)]
*  Michigan Republicans are thrilled that Democratic U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow is retiring in [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=533.06s)]
*  that state. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=539.26s)]
*  They would love to take that Senate seat in Michigan and so cue the headlines out of Michigan. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=540.62s)]
*  Quote, Michigan Republican candidate caught living in Florida. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=545.78s)]
*  This is about Republican Michigan U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=552.34s)]
*  His name is Mike Rogers. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=558.1s)]
*  This confluence of where he lives and his name led the Michigan advance to build the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=560.34s)]
*  perfect headline for this story, which is, quote, where is Mr. Rogers' neighborhood? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=566.1800000000001s)]
*  Mike Rogers, again, wants to be the senator for Michigan, but he does appear to be registered [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=573.86s)]
*  to vote in Florida at his very nice house in Cape Coral, Florida, where he is registered [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=578.3s)]
*  with the Republican Party of Florida voter status active. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=584.02s)]
*  Where is Mr. Rogers' neighborhood, indeed? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=588.5799999999999s)]
*  In Arizona, the Senate seat there is another one that Republicans would absolutely love [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=592.14s)]
*  to pick up with Kirsten Sinema retiring. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=596.5s)]
*  The Republican Senate candidate in Arizona, Carrie Lake, she does appear to live in Arizona, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=599.78s)]
*  which is a big plus for this crop of Republican Senate candidates, kind of a notable distinction, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=607.0999999999999s)]
*  in fact. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=611.9799999999999s)]
*  But in the case of Arizona, you're going to need more than that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=613.54s)]
*  Because this, for example, is the new ad that the Democratic Senate campaign committee just [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=618.3s)]
*  put out on Carrie Lake as a Senate candidate in Arizona and the issue of abortion rights [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=621.9399999999999s)]
*  in that state. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=627.6199999999999s)]
*  I'm incredibly thrilled that we are going to have a great law that's already on the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=638.06s)]
*  books. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=643.5s)]
*  I believe it's ARS 13-3603. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=644.5s)]
*  So it will prohibit abortion in Arizona, paving the way and setting course for other states [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=647.5s)]
*  to follow. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=653.0999999999999s)]
*  This law passed. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=657.66s)]
*  The Arizona Supreme Court said this is the law of Arizona. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=658.9799999999999s)]
*  But unfortunately, the people running our state have said we're not going to enforce [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=662.2199999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=665.9799999999999s)]
*  It's really political theater. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=666.98s)]
*  We don't have that law as much as many of us wish we did. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=668.5s)]
*  She's not enforcing the law. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=671.4200000000001s)]
*  So we don't have that law. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=673.4200000000001s)]
*  The only people who can enforce that law are our sheriffs. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=674.4200000000001s)]
*  And we need to start asking the sheriffs why we're going to enforce that law. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=678.4200000000001s)]
*  I haven't changed, actually, no. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=682.4200000000001s)]
*  Carrie Lake is the Republican Party's best idea of who they should run for the United [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=690.4200000000001s)]
*  States Senate seat that they really want to take this year in Arizona. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=694.7s)]
*  But I mean, clock the context, the specifics that she was offering there in that clip. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=699.9000000000001s)]
*  She wants individual sheriffs in Arizona to start enforcing the state's 1864 abortion [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=707.0600000000001s)]
*  ban. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=713.26s)]
*  Sheriffs and sheriff deputies, get out there. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=714.98s)]
*  Get to it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=718.22s)]
*  Get out on the streets. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=719.22s)]
*  Find out who's pregnant. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=720.58s)]
*  We want the sheriffs enforcing this. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=722.46s)]
*  Watch when you cross county lines. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=726.34s)]
*  There's a lot going on in the Republican Party right now. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=730.34s)]
*  And I know that the party's presidential nominee, their most recent former president, Donald [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=734.46s)]
*  Trump, I know he sucks up all the oxygen in the room. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=740.0200000000001s)]
*  And for obvious reason, he gets all the coverage, he gets all the commentary. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=742.74s)]
*  But note what is going on in the Republican Party in the Trump era apart from him. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=746.1s)]
*  I mean, just look at Arizona for a second. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=751.78s)]
*  In Arizona, they are not only running Carrie Lake for Senate. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=754.86s)]
*  This weekend, Arizona Republicans just chose their state's representatives to the National [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=759.74s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=764.98s)]
*  You know, it's called the RNC, the Republican National Committee. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=765.98s)]
*  It is actually a committee. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=769.86s)]
*  Every state sends two people to be part of the committee that makes up the RNC, that [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=771.22s)]
*  makes up the National Republican Party. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=776.14s)]
*  Every state gets two choices. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=778.0600000000001s)]
*  This weekend, Arizona Republicans picked their two choices. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=779.78s)]
*  They decided their two choices would be this person who was literally expelled from the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=782.78s)]
*  state legislature recently after only being there for about three months. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=789.3000000000001s)]
*  Here's how that was described in the Arizona Republic. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=793.98s)]
*  Quote, she was expelled from the Republican controlled house just three months into her [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=796.78s)]
*  term. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=801.14s)]
*  This after she staged an all day live streamed legislative hearing at which her witnesses [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=802.14s)]
*  talked about the many ways in which our elections were supposedly stolen. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=806.22s)]
*  The highlight was a Scottsdale insurance agent who slimed dozens of public officials and [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=810.6999999999999s)]
*  private citizens, making preposterous evidence free accusations that they all accepted bribes [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=814.98s)]
*  from the Sinaloa drug cartel. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=820.66s)]
*  The House Ethics Committee unanimously concluded that the state legislator not only knew what [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=823.86s)]
*  that insurance agent was likely to say during that hearing, but that the legislator actually [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=829.26s)]
*  took steps to hide the details from House leadership. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=834.1s)]
*  Then she lied about it to the ethics panel. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=838.7s)]
*  Now she's a top ranking official in the Republican Party. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=841.8199999999999s)]
*  She's one of Arizona's two representatives to the Republican National Committee, chosen [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=846.06s)]
*  this weekend by the Arizona Republican Party. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=850.26s)]
*  But they remember they get to pick two. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=853.26s)]
*  The second representative Arizona Republicans just chose to represent their state at the [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=854.8199999999999s)]
*  RNC is this person who was a very special variety of Arizona Republican state senator. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=859.04s)]
*  Here's how Lori Roberts at the Arizona Republic describes him today. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=866.16s)]
*  Quote, meet Jake Hoffman, Arizona's new Republican National Committee man. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=869.76s)]
*  This Queen Creek Republican burst into public view in 2020 when he ran an internet troll [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=874.9599999999999s)]
*  farm paying teenagers to post conservative talking points and baseless conspiracy theories [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=880.36s)]
*  on social media, all aimed at getting then President Donald Trump reelected. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=887.2s)]
*  The Washington Post in September 2020 exposed Hoffman's Rally Forge, a digital marketing [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=892.32s)]
*  firm where his job was to pay teenagers, some of the minors, to set up fake personas and [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=898.72s)]
*  blanket social media with thousands of nearly identical posts aimed at undermining confidence [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=905.4s)]
*  in the validity of the election and downplaying the impact of COVID-19. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=910.0s)]
*  In other words, Jake Hoffman wanted to fool you into thinking these were real people spontaneously [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=915.28s)]
*  expressing deeply held conservative beliefs instead of what they were. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=919.5799999999999s)]
*  A group of kids he was paying to deceive you. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=924.22s)]
*  The Post cast doubt on the integrity of mail-in ballots and said that Joe Biden is, quote, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=927.52s)]
*  being controlled by behind-the-scenes individuals who want to take America down the dangerous [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=932.48s)]
*  path toward socialism. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=937.64s)]
*  Quote, it's the kind of thing you might expect to come out of Russia. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=939.92s)]
*  Instead, it came out of Phoenix, or more specifically, Jake Hoffman's secret cell of paid teenage [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=944.6800000000001s)]
*  trolls. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=951.5600000000001s)]
*  That troll farm in Phoenix was exposed in September of 2020. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=955.88s)]
*  The same gentleman went on in December of 2020 to be one of the fake electors from Arizona [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=960.3000000000001s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=967.36s)]
*  He, in fact, is one of the fake electors who was just criminally indicted in Arizona for [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=968.36s)]
*  his alleged role in that scheme. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=973.4s)]
*  So he was indicted last week and named Republican National Committee man for the state of Arizona [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=975.12s)]
*  just days later. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=981.12s)]
*  So it's not like they didn't know he'd been indicted. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=982.12s)]
*  They knew he was indicted, then they picked him afterwards. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=984.68s)]
*  There are at least 53 people who have now been criminally charged with participating [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=990.92s)]
*  in the effort to keep Trump in power after he lost reelection in 2020. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=996.26s)]
*  And I'm not talking about the people who physically attacked Congress to try to intimidate and [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1000.92s)]
*  physically stop Congress from certifying the vote count on January 6th. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1006.0s)]
*  I mean, you can hive all of those hundreds of people off. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1009.6s)]
*  There are still at least 53 Republican Party officials and lawyers and activists who are [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1012.64s)]
*  facing felony criminal counts other than Donald Trump himself. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1019.5s)]
*  And this is sort of, this is me making my case to you. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1026.64s)]
*  I think it is an underappreciated part of the politics of the Republican Party in the [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1030.18s)]
*  Trump era. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1035.66s)]
*  I think it is an underappreciated part of politics in our country right now as Trump [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1036.7800000000002s)]
*  is trying to return to the presidency again. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1041.26s)]
*  That not only is he in the dock facing felony criminal charges as he tries to return to [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1043.9s)]
*  the White House, but also in the dock are the chair or former chair of the state Republican [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1049.18s)]
*  parties in Arizona and Michigan and Georgia and Nevada and serving Republican elected [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1056.74s)]
*  officials in all of those states and they are all swing states. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1065.22s)]
*  Trump adviser Peter Navarro is in jail right now. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1070.54s)]
*  Today, the U.S. Supreme Court again rejected another request from him to get out of prison. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1074.46s)]
*  He is currently serving time in prison for refusing to testify about his role in Trump's [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1079.02s)]
*  efforts to overthrow the government. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1084.06s)]
*  Trump attorney Jeff Clark just learned today that in his disbarment proceedings in California, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1086.3799999999999s)]
*  the Disciplinary Council for the State Bar Association is arguing to the court that there [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1091.4599999999998s)]
*  is no sanction other than disbarment that is suitable for Jeff Clark given what he did. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1095.36s)]
*  Quote, it would be inconsistent with our duty to the disciplinary system and to the profession [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1100.6999999999998s)]
*  to even suggest that a sanction other than disbarment should be contemplated. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1105.78s)]
*  By attempting to violate the rules of professional conduct, Jeff Clark, quote, betrayed those [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1110.74s)]
*  oaths and in doing so his country, lawyers who betray their country must be disbarred. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1115.1399999999999s)]
*  And I know that the former president himself, former president and Republican presidential [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1124.86s)]
*  nominee, I know him, him being on trial for multiple felonies is an amazing and unprecedented [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1131.26s)]
*  and frankly astonishing spectacle. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1136.98s)]
*  But stick a pin in that idea of astonishing, right? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1139.94s)]
*  Because the crime he is alleged to have quarterbacked to try to keep himself in power despite losing [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1144.32s)]
*  reelection, that crime is now a sprawling nationwide scandal that has resulted in dozens [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1149.6200000000001s)]
*  of Republican officials almost in almost all the swing states being criminally charged [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1157.22s)]
*  and in all of the prominent lawyers involved in that effort, either being criminally charged [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1162.66s)]
*  or having their law licenses put at risk or both. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1167.02s)]
*  And yes, Trump himself will be back in court tomorrow and there's stuff to know about that. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1171.18s)]
*  We're going to we're going to get to that tonight. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1175.42s)]
*  But no matter what happens to him in his own felony cases and in his own political trajectory, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1178.8600000000001s)]
*  do not lose sight of what is happening to the Republican Party while they have been [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1184.3s)]
*  drafting off him in the lead. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1188.68s)]
*  Because it is an astonishing story on its own. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVOJHRvR5A&t=1192.22s)]
