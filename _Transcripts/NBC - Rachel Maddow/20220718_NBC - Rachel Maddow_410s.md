# Doctors Sound Alarm As Ignorant Abortion Bans Hurt Medical Care, Cause Undue Suffering
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU)
*  In Wisconsin, a woman had an incomplete miscarriage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=0.0s)]
*  She bled for more than 10 days after emergency room staff would not remove the fetal tissue from her uterus. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=3.44s)]
*  They were afraid they could be prosecuted if they did so under a law banning abortion that is now in effect in Wisconsin. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=9.72s)]
*  Doctors at a hospital in Michigan found themselves treating a woman from out of state. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=16.96s)]
*  She had had to cross state lines to get care for a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=20.84s)]
*  An ectopic pregnancy is never viable. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=25.76s)]
*  Doctors say that it could have caused a rupture at any moment that could have killed this woman, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  but a doctor in her home state worried that the presence of a fetal heartbeat made a procedure to remove it illegal [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=32.96s)]
*  and wouldn't do it even though it risked her life. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=39.4s)]
*  In Louisiana, a doctor described treating a patient whose water broke at 16 weeks. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=43.08s)]
*  The fetus was not viable. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Continuing the pregnancy at that point would put the woman's life at risk. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=48.76s)]
*  The patient wanted her doctor to perform a common 15-minute abortion procedure. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=52.2s)]
*  But the patient was told that under Louisiana's new law outlawing abortion, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=57.16s)]
*  she would have to have an induced delivery instead. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  In an affidavit filed in court, the doctor said her patient, quote, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=64.28s)]
*  was forced to go through a painful hours-long labor to deliver a non-viable fetus, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  despite her wishes and best medical advice. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=73.96s)]
*  Quote, she was screaming not from pain, but from the emotional trauma she was experiencing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=76.72s)]
*  And then she hemorrhaged nearly a liter of blood. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  The doctor said, quote, there is absolutely no medical basis for my patient or any other patient in the state to experience anything like this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=85.56s)]
*  This was the first time in my 15-year career I could not give a patient the care they needed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=92.16s)]
*  This is a travesty. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=96.48s)]
*  One OB GYN in Texas described a recent patient who had started to miscarry and developed a dangerous infection in her womb. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=99.4s)]
*  The fetus still had signs of a heartbeat, though, so an immediate abortion, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=107.6s)]
*  which would be the usual standard of care, that would have been illegal under Texas's abortion ban. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=111.64s)]
*  The doctor said, quote, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=116.72s)]
*  We physically watched her get sicker and sicker and sicker until the fetal heartbeat stopped the next day and then we could intervene. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=117.52s)]
*  The patient developed complications, required surgery, lost multiple liters of blood, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=124.92s)]
*  and had to be put on a breathing machine, all because we were essentially 24 hours behind. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=130.12s)]
*  Those are just a handful of the stories that doctors have been willing to put on the record about the practical consequences all over the country of the Supreme Court overturning the right to an abortion. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=137.32s)]
*  It is not theoretical. It is happening now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=146.96s)]
*  We are already seeing mass chaos among OB GYNs, emergency room physicians and, quite frankly, pharmacists. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=149.72s)]
*  OB GYNs who are sitting on patients in emergency rooms while they bleed, while their vital signs become unstable, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=156.48s)]
*  while they're waiting for hospital lawyers to decide, is this patient sick enough? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=163.4s)]
*  That is Dr. Colleen McNicholas. She's an OB GYN who practices in Missouri and Illinois. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=168.8s)]
*  Joining us now is Dr. Colleen McNicholas. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=173.68s)]
*  She's chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region in southwest Missouri. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=175.68s)]
*  Dr. McNicholas, it's nice to see you. Thanks very much for making time to be here. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  Thanks so much, Rachel. Happy to be here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=184.28s)]
*  So in Missouri, one of the places you practice, abortion is now illegal except in medical emergencies that cause irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=186.88s)]
*  You said that standard in Missouri is basically causing mass chaos at a practical level in terms of what care doctors can provide and what women have to go through. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=199.44s)]
*  Is anything resolving over time? Is anything becoming more clear? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, we've heard you open with lots of stories from not just Missouri, but from across the country where physicians are really struggling because this medical emergency exception is totally unworkable. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=212.92s)]
*  Folks are not practicing the best medicine because they're afraid of going to prison. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=226.2s)]
*  In terms of what remedies are available here, I was curious when you talked about hospitals, lawyers and health systems, lawyers. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  Particularly big hospitals, big legal departments, big institutions that are considering issues like this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  Could they be taking a more proactive stance on this? Instead of telling doctors to wait for a patient to be sick enough, could they say, give your best care and if they come after you, if it comes to it, we will defend you? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  Is there a way to be more forward leaning on this, particularly doctors who have more institutional support than people who are operating in private or small practices? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=263.8s)]
*  You know, sure, it's always great to have the support of your institution and the lawyers there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=273.72s)]
*  But the truth is, if you live in a state with an aggressive and rabidly anti-choice attorney general, no reassurance from your hospital or from your hospital legal system or lawyers is going to make you feel comfortable enough to continue to provide that care when the reality is that it's a criminal penalty to violate this law. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=279.72s)]
*  And so it's just totally unworkable and has led to, as I said in the hearing, total chaos among a group of health care professionals who went in this to heal people and not to have to sit there and wait for other lawyers or attorney generals to tell them it's okay to proceed. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=301.64000000000004s)]
*  And you told that hearing last week that you wanted Congress to use every bit of your power to do something. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  What do you think they could do given what the Supreme Court has has undone? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=327.56s)]
*  You know, we've seen a good step in the statement around enforcement of EMTALA, the Emergency Medical Clause, that does say that hospitals and physicians, when presented with a patient in an emergency situation, must be treated. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=332.56s)]
*  But the truth is that's only going to affect the small minority of folks who need abortion care. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=347.56s)]
*  We need the administration and we need folks not just at the federal level, but at the state level and states where there is opportunity to further protect access to do so, to allocate funds and resources for patients who are needing to get that care, to provide safety and security for patients crossing state lines to get that care. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=353.48s)]
*  We really need a whole of government and truthfully a whole of medicine response to this public health emergency. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=371.48s)]
*  Dr. Colleen McNiglas, Chief Medical Officer of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region and southwest Missouri. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  I know this is a really difficult and as you say chaotic time. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for helping us understand. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  Thanks for what you do. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdLCx6naPU&t=407.48s)]
