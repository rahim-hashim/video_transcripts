# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Sept. 12
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns)
*  Here's more that we the American people now know, thanks to this new book from Jeffrey [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=0.0s)]
*  Berman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=5.16s)]
*  Quote, while Michael Cohen pled guilty, our office continued to pursue investigations [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=6.16s)]
*  related to other possible campaign finance violations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  When Bill Barr took over as U.S. Attorney General in February 2019, six months after [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=14.56s)]
*  Cohen's guilty plea, he not only tried to kill the ongoing investigations we were engaged [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=18.88s)]
*  But incredibly, he suggested that Cohen's conviction on campaign finance charges should [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=26.92s)]
*  be reversed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  Barr summoned my deputy Rob Kusami, who was overseeing the Cohen case, in late February [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  to challenge the basis of Cohen's plea as well as the reasoning behind pursuing similar [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  campaign finance charges against other individuals. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=42.84s)]
*  Kusami was told to cease all investigative work on the campaign finance allegations until [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=45.72s)]
*  until Maine Justice determined there was a legal basis for the campaign finance charges [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=51.72s)]
*  to which Cohen pled guilty and until Barr determined there was a sufficient federal [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=56.12s)]
*  interest in pursuing charges against others. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=60.16s)]
*  The directive Bill Barr gave my deputy Rob Kusami, which was amplified that same day [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=65.08s)]
*  by a follow-up call from Edward O'Callaghan, that directive was explicit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=70.16s)]
*  Not a single investigative step could be taken, not a single document in our possession could [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=74.82s)]
*  be reviewed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=79.24s)]
*  And if Maine Justice decided in the end that there was no legal basis for the charges, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=81.4s)]
*  well, the Attorney General of the United States would then direct us to dismiss the campaign [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=86.2s)]
*  finance guilty pleas of Michael Cohen, the man who implicated the Attorney General's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  boss, the President. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=96.0s)]
*  Barr's posture here raises obvious questions, Berman writes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=98.84s)]
*  Did he think dropping the campaign finance charges would bolster Trump's defense against [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=103.04s)]
*  impeachment charges? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  Was he trying to ensure that no other Trump associates or employees would be charged with [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=108.56s)]
*  making hush money payments or perhaps flip on the president? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=112.64s)]
*  Was the goal to ensure that the president could not be charged after leaving office? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=116.2s)]
*  Was it part of an effort to undo the entire series of investigations and prosecutions [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  over the past two years of those in the president's orbit? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=128.32s)]
*  At SDNY, Jeff Berman says he was told by Trump appointees to bring a prosecution against [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=134.76s)]
*  President Obama's White House counsel, despite the fact that that man had committed no crime. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=141.16s)]
*  Trump's attorney general also told Berman's office to stop investigating anybody else [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  who was involved in the campaign finance felonies that put the president's lawyer in prison, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=151.48s)]
*  campaign finance felonies that directly involved the president himself and were committed for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=157.2s)]
*  his benefit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=161.48s)]
*  They also tried to undo Michael Cohen's guilty plea. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=163.52s)]
*  They did not succeed in that, but they did delay by months any further investigation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=166.4s)]
*  into other people involved in Cohen's crimes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's not it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  Look at this from Berman's new book. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=176.60000000000002s)]
*  Trump's Justice Department tells SDNY not only that they want to evaluate the basis [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=178.96s)]
*  of Cohen's plea and they want SDNY to stop investigating anybody else who might have [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=184.22s)]
*  been involved in those crimes committed by the Trump campaign to try to cover up evidence [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=189.4s)]
*  of alleged affairs. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  SDNY also contacted was also contacted by Trump's Justice Department senior officials. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=197.56s)]
*  And they were told that they needed to get rid of all mentions of individual one in the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=204.52s)]
*  Michael Cohen indictment. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=209.96s)]
*  SDNY said no to that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=212.36s)]
*  They resisted, but SDNY officials did take out of the Michael Cohen related court filings [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=215.48s)]
*  the most direct language they'd had in those filings saying what role Trump played in those [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=220.96s)]
*  crimes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=227.16s)]
*  Here's how Berman describes it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  Justice interfered when the information was being finalized. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=230.4s)]
*  After Michael Cohen agreed to plead guilty, the charging instrument for him became an [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=234.6s)]
*  information rather than an indictment. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=238.44s)]
*  Berman says quote, it was about 40 pages long and it referenced a person identified as individual [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=242.52s)]
*  one as having acted in concert with Cohen. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=247.52s)]
*  There was zero doubt as to the identity of individual one. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=250.08s)]
*  It was Donald J. Trump. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=252.6s)]
*  After SDNY sent the indictment, the information to main justice, quote, the next day, Robert [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=254.28s)]
*  Kuzami, my deputy who was overseeing the case, received a call from Edward O'Callaghan. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=259.52s)]
*  O'Callaghan was aggressive. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=264.44s)]
*  Why the length? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=266.03999999999996s)]
*  He wanted to know. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=267.12s)]
*  He argued that now that Cohen was pleading guilty, we don't need all this description. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=268.35999999999996s)]
*  Kuzami responded, what exactly are you concerned about? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  O'Callaghan proceeded to identify specific allegations he wanted removed, almost all of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=276.12s)]
*  which referenced individual one, Donald Trump. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  It quickly became apparent to Kuzami that contrary to what O'Callaghan professed, it [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  wasn't the overall length or the detail of the document that concerned him. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=288.68s)]
*  It was any mention of individual one. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=292.56s)]
*  Kuzami and O'Callaghan went through a handful of these allegations, some of which Kuzami [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=295.96s)]
*  agreed to strike, others he did not. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=299.36s)]
*  Sensing that this was going to be a long and adversarial process, Kuzami told O'Callaghan [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=302.32s)]
*  that he was now aware of O'Callaghan's concerns and the team would redraft the information [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=306.16s)]
*  and remove certain non-essential details. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=310.6s)]
*  The team was tasked with the rewrite. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=313.12s)]
*  They stayed up most of the night. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=314.52s)]
*  The revised information in Cohen's case was now 21 pages down from 40. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  It removed certain allegations, including allegations that individual one acted in concert [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=323.6s)]
*  with and coordinated with Cohen on the illegal campaign contributions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=329.8s)]
*  The information now alleged that Cohen acted in concert and coordinated with, quote, one [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=336.68s)]
*  or more members of the campaign. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=342.08000000000004s)]
*  So individual one, Donald Trump, he did this stuff with Donald Trump becomes, he did this [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=345.72s)]
*  stuff with someone from the campaign. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  The specific mentions of Cohen committing this crime, this federal felony, in concert [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=356.28000000000003s)]
*  with and coordinating with Trump in the commission of the crime, those specific references were [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  taken out of this court filing to not mention Trump specifically. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=367.6s)]
*  And the investigators in that case were also directed by main justice that they needed [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=374.8s)]
*  to stop investigating anybody other than Michael Cohen for these crimes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=378.76s)]
*  And that delay lasted for months. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=384.12s)]
*  So now we know, right? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=387.6s)]
*  I mean, Michael Cohen kept saying in public, why am I the only person getting in trouble [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=388.6s)]
*  for this? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  It's not like I did it for myself. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=393.08000000000004s)]
*  It's not like I did it alone. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  Jeffrey Berman never gave a single interview while he was serving as U.S. attorney. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=397.16s)]
*  Now he's a former U.S. attorney. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=401.64000000000004s)]
*  And in his new book, he says that Bill Barr and Jeffrey Rosen and Rich Donahue and Edward [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=403.56s)]
*  O'Callaghan all participated in these sustained, very improper efforts by the Justice Department [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=409.36s)]
*  to corrupt federal law enforcement and to corrupt the power of federal prosecution to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=418.0s)]
*  help President Trump and respond to his whims and hurt his enemies. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=422.6s)]
*  Berman also says he was removed from his office because something about his work as U.S. attorney [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=428.24s)]
*  threatened the reelection of the president in 2020. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  First of all, what was that? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=436.0s)]
*  But second of all, what do we do here? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=438.6s)]
*  What do we do with this? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=440.6s)]
*  I mean, it is a problem for us as a country that we elected a president who wanted to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=441.6s)]
*  use the Justice Department like this. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=445.32000000000005s)]
*  We know that's a problem, I think. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=447.0s)]
*  One could argue, though, that it's an even bigger problem that there were all these senior [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=448.76000000000005s)]
*  Justice Department officials who were happy to do it, who did it, who perverted not just [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=452.32000000000005s)]
*  investigations but prosecutions and pleadings and sentences. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=458.68s)]
*  They actually did it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=462.8s)]
*  A corrupt man, a corrupt leader is a tragedy. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=465.52s)]
*  A law enforcement agency that has proven itself to be corruptible, that needs to be fixed. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=470.52s)]
*  This has to be fixed. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=478.16s)]
*  I will tell you tonight, since we have been on the air, the Senate Judiciary Committee [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  has just confirmed to us that they are launching an investigation into the claims made in Mr. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=485.8s)]
*  Berman's book. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=491.0s)]
*  In a letter sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland tonight, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=492.0s)]
*  the number two Senate Democrat, said, quote, These reported claims indicate astonishing [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=496.12s)]
*  and unacceptable deviations from the department's mission to pursue impartial justice, which [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=500.52s)]
*  requires that its prosecutorial decisions be free from political influence. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=505.12s)]
*  Senate Judiciary Committee has announced that it is launching this investigation. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=509.52s)]
*  Senator Durbin has told the Justice Department to hand over to the Judiciary Committee all [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=513.8s)]

*  to the Michael Cohen case, the John Kerry case, and the Gregory Craig case, as detailed [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=524.8399999999999s)]
*  in Jeffrey Berman's brand new book. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=530.28s)]
*  Joining us now is Jeffrey Berman, former U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=533.9599999999999s)]
*  York from 2018 to 2020 when he was forced out by former Attorney General Bill Barr and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=537.04s)]
*  he refused to resign. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=542.84s)]
*  His new book is holding the line inside the nation's preeminent U.S. Attorney's Office [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=544.3199999999999s)]
*  and its battle with the Trump Justice Department. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=547.92s)]
*  Mr. Berman, the book comes out tomorrow. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=551.12s)]
*  I really appreciate you being here tonight to talk with us about it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=552.88s)]
*  This is a lot. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=555.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  First, let me just ask you, I've read the book closely backwards and forwards as have [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  members of my staff and helping me prepare to talk with you tonight. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=563.9s)]
*  But I readily admit that I may have gotten some of these things wrong as I tried to sum [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=566.84s)]
*  them up. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=570.2s)]
*  I'm sorry if I said that struck you as wrong or misguided. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=571.6400000000001s)]
*  No, no, it was great. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=573.6400000000001s)]
*  All of it very accurate. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=576.6400000000001s)]
*  I have to ask you about this breaking news first. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=579.6400000000001s)]
*  Senator Dick Durbin, he chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, is the number two senator. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=581.6400000000001s)]
*  He's written to the Justice Department tonight and announced that the Judiciary Committee [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=587.6400000000001s)]
*  is launching a formal investigation. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=591.76s)]
*  He's asked the Department to hand over its documents and communications around these [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=593.76s)]
*  episodes that you described. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=600.56s)]
*  Do you believe that there will be documentation that these communications will be noted in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=601.56s)]
*  some way that the Department can provide to the Judiciary Committee so they can investigate [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=609.56s)]
*  these allegations? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=614.56s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure there are documents that are going to be available. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=615.56s)]
*  You know, Rachel, my book, as you know, is all about transparency. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=618.56s)]
*  You know, I wanted people to understand the full scope of the outrageous and improper [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=624.2399999999999s)]
*  political interference by Trump's Justice Department in the cases of the Southern District [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=631.92s)]
*  of New York. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=636.88s)]
*  It demonstrates what Trump is capable of and what he's likely to do, and it also provides [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=637.88s)]
*  a front-line view of just how vulnerable our justice system is. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=643.88s)]
*  The book is about transparency, and I welcome this investigation, this congressional investigation, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=650.24s)]
*  because I think a light has to be thrown on this kind of outrageous conduct that really [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=657.24s)]
*  corrupted the Department of Justice and turned it into a political instrument for the president. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=663.12s)]
*  Some of this conduct you are describing for the first time in this book, but some of this, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  for lack of a better phrase, squawked about at the time that they forced you out as U.S. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=677.48s)]
*  attorney. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  You put out this remarkable press release at the time. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=683.8000000000001s)]
*  You insisted that you would not resign, that when Bill Barr said you had resigned, that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=686.96s)]
*  he was lying about that. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=691.0s)]
*  It was a remarkable confrontation and sort of a stand-up moment on your part. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  I remember it unfolding late at night one Friday night, the summer of 2020, and I was [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=697.72s)]
*  just agog watching it happen in real time. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=701.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, I knew. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=704.1600000000001s)]
*  You saidâ [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=705.1600000000001s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=706.1600000000001s)]
*  It was a time that if Barr got me out the way he wanted to, he would put an outsider [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=707.88s)]
*  in that office who he trusted, and our sensitive investigations that were going on would have [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=714.28s)]
*  been jeopardized. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=720.7199999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, I was very noisy. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=722.28s)]
*  I told the entire country what I thought Barr was doing and how he crossed the line. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=725.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think because of that very noisy exit, as you said, Audrey Strauss took over as Acting [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=730.2199999999999s)]
*  U.S. Attorney, and she's a person of the highest integrity and an icon of the New York [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=736.96s)]
*  bar. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=741.52s)]
*  When you put out that press release, when you pushed back in that noisy way, you saidâI'm [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=743.8000000000001s)]
*  quoting from it hereâ [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=748.36s)]
*  "...our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=749.36s)]
*  I intend to ensure that this office's important cases continue unimpeded." [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=752.76s)]
*  And you explain in the book that you chose those words carefully because they reference [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=758.32s)]
*  the actual language of the criminal statute on obstruction of justice. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=763.0s)]
*  I have to ask, the implication of that explanation in your book is that it's possible that you [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=767.88s)]
*  believed it was sort of a crime what happened to your office, that what Trump appointees [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=774.24s)]
*  were trying to do to SDNY was criminal obstruction of justice. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=778.12s)]
*  Is that the implication that you are raising here? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=782.12s)]
*  Well, I haven't focused on whether it's a crime or not, but I can tell you it violated [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=783.96s)]
*  all the norms and traditions of the Department of Justice, which is supposed to be independent [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=789.52s)]
*  from politics. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=795.76s)]
*  And Trump turned the department into his own personal law firm. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=797.8s)]
*  He put in people who would do his bidding, and they would target Trump's political enemies [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=802.24s)]
*  and assist Trump's friends. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=811.4399999999999s)]
*  And it was a disgrace. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=813.68s)]
*  And that's what I kind of detail in the book, several instances of that. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=815.38s)]
*  You say throughout the book how you tried to stay and fight to keep SDNY from being [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=821.9399999999999s)]
*  corrupted, from the kind of hostile takeover that you describe having taken place in another [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=828.42s)]
*  very eminent U.S. attorney's office. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=832.66s)]
*  You have a few different times you say variations of I didn't want to get fired and replaced [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=837.72s)]
*  by somebody who would be completely compliant, as you just mentioned. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=841.22s)]
*  But I do have to ask you why, when they made you take the individual one language out of [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=845.9s)]
*  the Cohen information, when they told you to prosecute John Kerry or they told you to [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=852.1s)]
*  prosecute Greg Craig and do it before the election, why didn't we hear this from you [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=856.58s)]
*  then or if you couldn't do it then while you were still holding the job, why didn't [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=861.1s)]
*  we hear it from you when you were fired? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=864.86s)]
*  Well, there are rules, laws and statutes and regulations that prohibit DOJ employees and [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=866.54s)]
*  former employees from talking about ongoing cases and investigations as well as conversations, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=874.9s)]
*  internal conversations relating to those cases. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=883.54s)]
*  And we are bound by that. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=886.34s)]
*  And so for example, when I gave congressional testimony after I got fired and I went to [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=889.26s)]
*  the ethics office of the Southern District of New York and the ethics office at Maine [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=896.18s)]
*  And I said, what can I talk about? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=901.32s)]
*  Because there were ongoing investigations that were politically sensitive at the time [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=904.28s)]
*  I got fired and Barr knew about them. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=909.52s)]
*  And can I talk about it? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=913.16s)]
*  And the ruling that came down and I respected it is that you can't talk about any ongoing [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=915.5600000000001s)]
*  investigations because they might be jeopardized. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=921.48s)]
*  You can't talk about any other cases that went on. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=923.92s)]
*  You can't even talk about the conversations that you had with other Department of Justice [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=926.68s)]
*  employees except for the two days before you got fired, you can talk about Bill Barr and [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=933.4399999999999s)]
*  that's the authority I had when I went into my congressional testimony. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=939.8399999999999s)]
*  And quite frankly, it was frustrating because I couldn't tell the whole story and the whole [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=944.04s)]
*  story needed to be told. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=949.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's the reason I wrote the book. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=951.38s)]
*  And the book was put through pre-publication review by the Department of Justice. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=954.1999999999999s)]
*  I followed all the rules still. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=958.9599999999999s)]
*  I've never violated an internal DOJ rule or statute. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=961.16s)]
*  To this day, I'm in compliance with every rule and statute. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=965.88s)]
*  The book has been entirely vetted by the Department of Justice and I've gotten permission to publish [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=969.4s)]
*  it. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=974.26s)]
*  And that's, I think, why you don't hear more Department of Justice people talking about [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=975.26s)]
*  the cases they're working on, the investigations, conversations with other people because they're [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=979.4s)]
*  restricted from doing so and if they're to behave in an ethical manner, they can't do so. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=984.28s)]
*  You do say, towards the very end of the book, something that has, that resonates very loudly. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=995.4s)]
*  You say that you believe the reason you were forced out was based in politics. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1002.74s)]
*  The timing five months before the election was not an accident. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1006.84s)]
*  And you say that you believe Barr forced you out of that job at SDNY because he no doubt [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1010.32s)]
*  believed that by removing me, he could eliminate a threat to Trump's reelection. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1014.38s)]
*  How was your work as U.S. Attorney a threat to Trump's reelection? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1019.32s)]
*  Well, at the time I was fired, the Southern District of New York was working on a couple [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1022.2800000000001s)]
*  politically sensitive cases. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1029.04s)]
*  One of those cases is the Steve Bannon, We Build the Wall case. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1032.2s)]
*  And we were very close to indicting that case around the time I got fired and Barr knew [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1036.94s)]
*  about the case. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1042.38s)]
*  And as you know, that case was indicted by the Southern District of New York by Audrey [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1044.06s)]
*  Strauss who took over as acting U.S. Attorney after I was fired and she brought that prosecution. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  And then, you know, President Trump pardoned Steve Bannon, which was an outrageous pardon. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1057.74s)]
*  But that's one of the cases that we were investigating and we were very close to indicting. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1065.26s)]
*  And the other case was the Ukraine investigations arising out of the Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1071.54s)]
*  indictments. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1077.02s)]
*  And that was something that we had been investigating for quite a while and we continued to investigate [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKzcNipv2Ns&t=1079.02s)]
