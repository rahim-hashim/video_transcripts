# Photojournalist Captures The Humanity Surviving Putin's Onslaught
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08)
*  Let each of us, if you're able to stand, stand and send an unmistakable signal to the world, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=0.0s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=7.0s)]

*  Thank you, President Biden. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=12.0s)]
*  Thank you, President Biden. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=13.0s)]
*  During his State of the Union address tonight, leading a standing ovation for the people [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=14.0s)]
*  of Ukraine, represented in that chamber tonight by the First Lady's guest, Ukraine's ambassador [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=16.36s)]
*  to the United States, who sat with First Lady Jill Biden tonight. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=21.36s)]
*  Here's some images you should just take a look at of people in Kyiv, in Ukraine's capital. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=25.48s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=31.48s)]
*  A boy practicing with a rifle outside his home as his mother looks on. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  This group of four women, including a teacher in the center there who is crying as she waits [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=37.96s)]
*  to deploy with the Ukrainian military. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=42.64s)]
*  This group of men getting a briefing before they go out to join the fight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=44.5s)]
*  All these pictures were taken by an award-winning American photojournalist named Lindsay Adario [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  who's covered war zones for 20 years now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=54.76s)]
*  Right now she's in Ukraine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=58.04s)]
*  She's documenting the conflict for the New York Times. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=59.04s)]
*  And she joins us live now from Kyiv, where we're just coming up on 7 a.m. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  Lindsay Adario, thank you so much for being here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=65.88s)]
*  It's a real pleasure to have you with us. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=70.6s)]
*  I know that you have experience covering wars and war zones for more than 20 years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=72.36s)]
*  Are there misconceptions that you think the American public has about what's happening [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=79.28s)]
*  in Ukraine? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=83.18s)]
*  Are there things that you think we are either misunderstanding or just not seeing yet that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=84.22000000000001s)]
*  you think we should know? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=87.94000000000001s)]
*  I think this is actually one of the rare cases where there are not misconceptions. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=90.94000000000001s)]
*  I think in many of the wars I've covered, war can be raging in one part of the city, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=95.4s)]
*  but life goes on in the other part of the city. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=101.58000000000001s)]
*  That was common in Baghdad and Afghanistan and in many of the wars I've covered. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=104.26s)]
*  Here actually, it's pretty grim. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=109.54s)]
*  People are really preparing for the worst. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=112.42s)]
*  There are lines at grocery stores. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=114.78s)]
*  People are not panicking, but there are lines everywhere. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=116.56s)]
*  ATM's, pharmacies, people are trying to stock up because no one really knows what will happen. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  I think the thing that has been so moving to people around the world, particularly to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=126.78s)]
*  the American readers of the New York Times, is your photos showing regular Ukrainians, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=132.5s)]
*  civilians, people who have never thought of themselves as fighters, transforming themselves [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=137.3s)]
*  in this moment of crisis into soldiers, into warriors for their country. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=141.9s)]
*  I have to ask about what it's like to document that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=146.9s)]
*  This is not soldiers against soldiers. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=150.02s)]
*  It's not the Ukrainian army versus the Russian army that you are showing us in these images [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=151.94000000000003s)]
*  so much as it is the Russian army bearing down on school teachers and kids and moms. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=156.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, for me, war has always been about the civilian toll. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=163.94000000000003s)]
*  It's always been about the effect that war has on women and children and people who are not fighting. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=167.9s)]
*  I think that's the most important because they are always pretty often the biggest casualty of war. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=174.02s)]
*  For me, something like Julia, this teacher, we saw her from a distance. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=180.1s)]
*  We were trying to get access to this volunteer base. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=186.38s)]
*  Everything is very tense. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=189.22s)]
*  It's very hard to get access to every single one of these photos because people are suspicious. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=190.58s)]
*  They're worried about who we are or are there infiltrators among amongst us? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=195.58s)]
*  And so we finally got access and entered this van. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=200.38000000000002s)]
*  And I started talking to her along with Andre, who is working with me as a videographer and a fixer and a translator. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  And suddenly I realized she was crying. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  And there are moments when I'm photographing where I'm doing my job and I'm so focused and I'm trying to focus on getting a picture and doing a composition. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=215.22000000000003s)]
*  But then I realized these are people, these are people fighting for their country. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  They are people who are like leaving everything they have and going to fight. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=228.33999999999997s)]
*  And that says a lot. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about a photo that you took that was on the front page of The New York Times today. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=236.06s)]
*  It shows mothers holding their kids in a shelter inside a hospital in Keeve. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=242.77999999999997s)]
*  What can you tell us about the context of that that shot today, how those moms and kids are doing? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=247.98s)]
*  What was what was going through your mind when you when you took that remarkable image against on the front page of The Times today? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean, what I'm witnessing is this incredible resilience and people are just sort of resigned to the fact that this is what's happening. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  They've gone down. You have all of these mothers. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=268.86s)]
*  There are maybe a dozen, maybe two dozen mothers who have shifted down into a shelter beneath the hospital, a children's hospital here in Keeve. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  And they're just continuing to sterilize bottles, take care of their children, trying to stop them from crying. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=281.02s)]
*  Everything that any mother like myself has dealt with in the comfort of our own homes, they're doing it in a basement. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=286.9s)]
*  And, you know, I don't see anyone complaining. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=293.94s)]
*  No one is complaining. People are really just trying to band together and move on. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=297.34s)]
*  And it's just really heartbreaking. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=302.14s)]
*  Photojournalist Lindsay Adario live from Keeve, where we're coming up on on 7am, the sixth day of this war. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=304.53999999999996s)]
*  Lindsay, you are doing a huge public service and I know you're doing it at personal risk. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=311.41999999999996s)]
*  Please stay safe. Thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKViO8Btf08&t=315.41999999999996s)]
