# Irish Fishermen Plan To Disrupt Russian Naval War Games: 'Our Presence Is Our Protest'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E)
*  So off the coast of northern Norway, the government there operates a field of undersea sensors [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=0.0s)]
*  that among other things can detect the movements of passing submarines. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=6.68s)]
*  Unexpectedly and in a still unexplained incident back in November, someone or something cut [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  the cables linking those undersea sensors to their control stations on the shore. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Cables were ripped out, the sensors themselves were messed with, but the cables were cut. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=26.52s)]
*  And suspicion immediately fell on Russia as the potential culprit, particularly because [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=32.4s)]
*  they're known to have the capacity to mess with undersea cables, and they've done so [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=36.56s)]
*  before. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=40.72s)]
*  But the incident at least officially remains unsolved, although lots of Norwegian sources, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=41.96s)]
*  including government sources, have been sort of indicating that their top suspect in this [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=47.68s)]
*  sabotage is the Russian military. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=52.8s)]
*  And that happened in November. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=55.6s)]
*  Then two weeks ago, what happened again? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=57.88s)]
*  Another set of undersea cables off the coast of Norway were mysteriously cut. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  This time it was cables that, among other things, they supply data to a huge commercial [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=65.56s)]
*  ground satellite array, a satellite array that Russia has been complaining about for [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=70.4s)]
*  years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=75.44s)]
*  Russia says that that satellite array, they think it's secretly and illegally being used [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=76.44s)]
*  for military communications when it's not supposed to be. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  But that satellite array is not being used for anything now because somehow the undersea [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=84.44s)]
*  cables that supply data to it, they again appear to have been messed with. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=87.86s)]
*  The cables appear to have been cut. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=91.64s)]
*  And then there's Ireland. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=93.7s)]
*  Couple of months before the first set of Norwegian undersea cables was mysteriously cut, couple [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=96.32s)]
*  of months before that, the Irish government got righteously freaked out when this Russian [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=102.4s)]
*  ship turned up right off the coast of Donegal in northwest Ireland. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=108.68s)]
*  Officially, this is an oceanographic research vessel that's operated by the Russian Navy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=114.16s)]
*  But it's a very high tech, very recently built vessel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=119.8s)]
*  And in terms of its technical capacity, lots of governments around the world think that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=122.44s)]
*  this is a huge spy ship. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=126.72s)]
*  And they think specifically the Russian Navy built this ship to target undersea cables. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=128.32s)]
*  Among other things, this ship can launch a bunch of different small manned submarines [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=134.94s)]
*  that can dive super deep. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  They can dive like 20,000 feet deep. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=140.84s)]
*  And when this ship turned up off the coast, the west coast of Ireland in August, here's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=144.4s)]
*  how the Times reported at the time on Irish worries that that Russian ship weirdly maneuvering [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=148.32s)]
*  off the Irish coast might be messing with undersea cables and communications. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=154.12s)]
*  See the headline there, Russian spy ship monitored off coast of Donegal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=159.72s)]
*  Quote, a Russian spy ship built to carry out clandestine undersea missions is being monitored [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  by the defense forces off the west coast. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=167.44s)]
*  The Yantar, which is part of the Russian Navy, arrived unexpectedly off the Donegal [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=169.7s)]
*  coastline on Tuesday night. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=173.66s)]
*  The vessel is equipped with, again this is in August last year. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=176.0s)]
*  The vessel is equipped with manned and remote operated submersibles used to attach listening [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=179.54s)]
*  devices to undersea cables that carry internet traffic between continents. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=184.7s)]
*  There's at least one commercial subsea cable in the general region where the Russian vessel [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=189.82s)]
*  is loitering. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=194.33999999999997s)]
*  The ship spent the early hours of Wednesday morning traversing the seas to the north of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  Mayo and west of Donegal in a zigzag fashion, suggesting it was searching for something [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=199.56s)]
*  beneath the waves using sonar. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=204.78s)]
*  The ship moved to a location to the west of Kilibegs, I guess is how you say it, Kilibegs [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=208.02s)]
*  fishing harbor. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday afternoon before moving further out into the Atlantic, the vessel's behavior [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=215.0s)]
*  was described as highly suspicious by military sources. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=218.7s)]
*  Again that was August. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=224.38s)]
*  The Irish government, Irish Defense Forces, is freaking out about that Russian spy ship [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=227.36s)]
*  off its west coast, particularly because it was in the vicinity of those cables and particularly [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=230.48s)]
*  because of what everybody thinks the Russians are doing with undersea cables right now in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=235.08s)]
*  the advance potentially of its next invasion of Ukraine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=238.76s)]
*  Well now next week, again off the coast of Ireland, Russia says it's going to mount major [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=244.36s)]
*  naval war games exercises. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=250.16s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=253.68s)]
*  The exact location of the drill is an area known as the Porcupine Sea Bight, southwest [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=255.46s)]
*  of Cork. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=261.66s)]
*  That exact location is also causing anxiety in Ireland. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=262.98s)]
*  If the purposes of the exercises are benign, it would be far easier for Russia to hold [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=266.74s)]
*  these exercises closer to its own shores. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  Military sources say it's not unheard of for foreign navies to conduct drills inside the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=273.5s)]
*  Irish economic zone. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=278.14s)]
*  But they usually have a good reason for it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=280.14s)]
*  It makes sense for the Royal Navy to conduct exercises in that area of the Atlantic because [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=282.66s)]
*  that's on their doorstep. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't make practical sense for the Russians to be there, said one naval service source. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=288.0s)]
*  If the Russian military exercises are linked to an invasion of Ukraine, they may serve [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=293.64000000000004s)]
*  one of several purposes according to military planners. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  One is psychological, to remind NATO of the Russian Navy's freedom of movement, which [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=300.8s)]
*  may make NATO members think twice about launching retaliatory military action. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=304.86s)]
*  Another possibility is strategic. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=310.88s)]
*  If the situation in Ukraine deteriorates significantly, one of the first priorities of NATO would [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=313.44s)]
*  likely be to box in as much of the Russian fleet as possible into their ports. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=318.02s)]
*  It is in Russia's interest to disperse its ships in international waters ahead of any [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=322.64s)]
*  such eventuality. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=327.34s)]
*  For Ireland, the worst-case scenario is that Russia is positioning itself to disable the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=329.92s)]
*  subsea infrastructure running along the southern coast and connecting Europe and North America. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=334.92s)]
*  The Russian military drills next week are due to take place directly above the nexus [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=340.36s)]
*  of many of the internet cables that connect the two continents, that connect North America [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=344.52s)]
*  and Europe. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=349.52s)]
*  Cutting those cables would immediately cripple the economies of NATO countries and Ireland. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=350.68s)]
*  Cutting the cables was described by one naval source as the perfect counterpunch against [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=356.74s)]
*  any NATO or US military response in Ukraine. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=361.12s)]
*  Quote, if I wanted to invade Ukraine and hamstring my opponents, I would want to cut those cables. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=364.24s)]
*  It would be lights out for the economy of Western Europe. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=369.8s)]
*  I mean, every country in the world, every country in the West, is worried about Russia [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=373.24s)]
*  potentially starting this new war. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=378.2s)]
*  Everybody except for our friends at Fox News primetime who are apparently rooting for Russia [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=380.84000000000003s)]
*  in this instance and wouldn't mind a war. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=384.32s)]
*  But elsewhere in the West, everybody's worried about it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=388.12s)]
*  And this is Ireland's very specific concern of how they might be in the middle of it in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=393.24s)]
*  the way they really do not want to be in the middle of it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=397.72s)]
*  The problem is for all of Ireland's concern about it and for as forewarned and forearmed [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=400.36s)]
*  as they are about it because of that Russian spy ship turning off their coast just a few [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=405.0s)]
*  months ago, there's not much that Ireland itself can do about it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=408.44000000000005s)]
*  I mean, Ireland, I mean, no offense, but they do not have much of a Navy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=412.6s)]
*  Ireland literally has no military radar in the entire country. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  They don't have military radar. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=422.76000000000005s)]
*  They have navigational radar, but no military radar. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=424.16s)]
*  Ireland does not have a single ship that's capable of like launching a helicopter off [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=427.24s)]
*  of it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=430.76s)]
*  They just they just don't have that kind of military capacity. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=431.76s)]
*  So what can they do? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, you know what Ireland does have to defend itself in this instance? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  It has very annoyed fishermen, Irish fishermen who are so mad about what Russia is going [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=445.12s)]
*  to do with these war games off their coast next week that they, the fishermen say that [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=454.64s)]
*  they personally have a plan to stop it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=459.44s)]
*  Fishermen say they're considering plans to peacefully disrupt Russian naval exercises [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=465.4s)]
*  off the Southwest coast next month. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=470.0s)]
*  The decision by the Russian Navy to conduct live gunnery and a missile firing exercise [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=472.2s)]
*  116 nautical miles off the mizzen next month is causing huge concern for fishermen gathered [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=477.08s)]
*  on the pier in Castletown Bear this morning. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=483.44s)]
*  If someone came into your backyard and said they were doing an army exercise, you wouldn't [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=486.64s)]
*  be happy about it either would live fire. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=491.48s)]
*  The Russian military exercise is due to take place over five days near the Porcubine Bight, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=493.24s)]
*  an area within Ireland's exclusive economic zone, rich with prawns and blue whiting, giving [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=497.96s)]
*  rise to fears for the fishing grounds and marine life. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=503.76s)]
*  They're not going to be firing bow and arrows at each other, you know, but I mean, this [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=506.76s)]

*  So our protest is our presence outside there that we're going to continue to fish out there [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=521.0400000000001s)]
*  and we're raising the awareness that we're there when this is happening. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=525.12s)]
*  The sea is our working environment, it's where we should be safe, we shouldn't be dealing [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=529.0s)]

*  In a statement this evening, the Russian embassy said that it had spoken to the fishermen's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=539.24s)]

*  the military exercise would be a reckless and irresponsible act which could put both [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=548.56s)]

*  Fishermen say up to 60 trawlers will fish in the area in peaceful protest. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=565.76s)]

*  When one boat needs to return to port, another will head out so there is a continuous presence [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=578.72s)]
*  on the water. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=582.4s)]
*  If that is in proximity to where the Russian military exercise is going on, we are expecting [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=583.4s)]
*  that the Russian naval services will abide by anti-collision regulations. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=587.4s)]
*  Will abide by anti-collision regulations, which sounds well and good, but sir, to be [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=592.4s)]
*  clear, do you mean you're going to go out there in your little Irish fishing boats and [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=598.0400000000001s)]
*  confront the Russian navy? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=602.1600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=605.2s)]
*  Yes, they are perfectly clear that is what they are going to do. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=606.64s)]
*  This was Morning Ireland this morning on RTE. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=610.2s)]
*  Are you planning to face down the Russians, Patrick? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=616.2s)]
*  Well, we're entitled to go fishing in areas outside there. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=619.52s)]
*  This is our waters. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=622.44s)]
*  Let me put it this way to everybody else to understand this. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=623.72s)]
*  Can you imagine if the Russians were applying to go onto the mainland of Ireland to go launching [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=626.8399999999999s)]
*  rockets? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=630.76s)]
*  How far would they get with that? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=631.76s)]
*  It's so different to fishermen. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=633.2399999999999s)]
*  This is our ground. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=634.4s)]
*  This is our farm. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=635.4s)]
*  This is where we are and are living. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=636.4s)]
*  Why should somebody be able to come in and do that in our waters, in our territorial [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=637.4s)]
*  waters just by your leave? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=640.88s)]
*  This is a very important ground where fish come to spawn, the mackerel, and we don't [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=643.04s)]
*  know what's going on out here. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  So for us, we should be entitled to go fishing there. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=649.8s)]
*  And if we're fishing there, then these boats and these vessels, warships shouldn't be [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=652.76s)]
*  having war games. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=656.5600000000001s)]
*  And not only that, these warships will be followed by submarines and we have our gear [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=657.76s)]
*  out behind our boats. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=663.08s)]
*  What if they get tangled in it? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=664.08s)]
*  This has happened before. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=665.48s)]
*  Boats have been sunk by these vessels. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=666.48s)]
*  This is a real concern to us. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=668.84s)]
*  And we in our industry feel that nothing's being done here like everything else. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=670.6s)]
*  And we want to act. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=675.36s)]
*  And this is how we're going to act. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=676.36s)]
*  It sounds a bit risky. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=677.36s)]
*  Sounds a bit risky. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=681.0s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=684.0s)]
*  But that is the plan. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=685.0s)]
*  The whole world, to Vladimir Putin's great delight, the whole world is on tenterhooks [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=687.0s)]
*  waiting to find out whether Russia is going to start another war. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=692.2s)]
*  Irish fishermen, on the other hand, are heading out to actively stop it and fish for mackerel [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=696.08s)]
*  while they're at it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=702.12s)]
*  God bless them, every single one of them. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUKJ2V3W0E&t=704.08s)]
