Video Description: As Americans become increasingly aware of the likelihood that Republicans will try to subvert a potential 2024 election loss by Donald Trump with a plan to hijack the election administration apparatus and prevent (or just make a mess of) the election certification process, more people are wondering how to stop such a scheme from happening. Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, talks with Rachel Maddow about a new expert report that outlines strategies for combating efforts to interfere with the certification of the vote.

# EXCLUSIVE: New report aims to protect election certification from Trump subversion strategy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM)
*  It is called, say it with me now, Project 2025. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=0.0s)]
*  And it has become a point of central discussion in this presidential election year. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=3.4s)]
*  It's because this playbook was designed for Trump, came out of sort of Trump world, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=10.56s)]
*  but it also is because it outlines policies that voters, as a general matter, really, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=17.56s)]
*  really, really don't want. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=23.84s)]
*  So this was created for Trump by people associated with Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=26.2s)]
*  Trump, now realizing how unpopular it is, he keeps trying to distance himself from it, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=30.08s)]
*  saying he has no idea who these people are who wrote this thing. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=33.88s)]
*  Unfortunately for him, here he is on a private plane with the guy who's in charge of it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=36.96s)]
*  His running mate, J.D. Vance, is also pals with the Project 2025 guy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=41.96s)]
*  He just wrote a foreword for his new book. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=45.24s)]
*  Then there's this over at the AP a few days ago. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Former Trump administration official teasing the fact that he is currently writing the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=50.68s)]
*  super secret transition playbook that Trump will use if he's reelected in November. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=54.32s)]
*  This guy planning the transition. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=59.0s)]
*  You will notice the headline offers a helpful reminder that this isn't the first playbook [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=60.96s)]
*  he's written. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=64.8s)]
*  The guy planning the Trump transition is a, quote, Project 2025 architect. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=65.8s)]
*  Six of Trump's cabinet officials collaborated on the drafting of the Project 2025 playbook. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=72.68s)]
*  Another 140 Trump administration staffers had a hand in working on it in some capacity. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=77.56s)]
*  All of that put together makes it a hard sell for the Trump campaign to claim that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=83.64s)]
*  they had no idea who these people are who wrote up this thing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=86.76s)]
*  And that was before this happened. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=91.08s)]
*  ProPublica has now obtained and published 14 hours of training videos put together by [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=92.72s)]
*  Project 2025. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=97.9s)]
*  They're essentially tutorials for members of the future Trump administration. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=98.9s)]
*  And the videos are interesting to look at in their own right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=104.88s)]
*  But for the Trump campaign, trying to say that no Trump people have ever had anything [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=107.36s)]
*  to do with this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  They've never heard of anything, any of these people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  They don't even know where this thing came from. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  For the Trump campaign trying to make that case, these new videos are not going to help [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=118.63999999999999s)]
*  them make that case. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=122.55999999999999s)]
*  Hello, my name is Jeff Small. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=124.55999999999999s)]
*  I was a presidential appointee in the Trump administration. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=127.28s)]
*  My name is Caroline Levitz and I am a former political appointee in the Donald J. Trump [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=129.72s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  I served in the Trump administration. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=135.79999999999998s)]
*  Pam, you started on day one of the Trump administration and you stayed until the final hour. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=137.8s)]
*  Shocking that I made it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=145.44s)]
*  Poor Pam. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=146.84s)]
*  They must have really put her through the wringer. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=147.84s)]
*  Of the 36 different people who appear in these videos that are obtained by ProPublica, 29 [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=151.56s)]
*  of the 36 of them are people who directly worked for the Trump administration or the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=158.32s)]
*  Trump campaign. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=163.32s)]
*  We have fresh new polling today from UMass Amherst painting a very clear portrait of [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=164.92s)]
*  why the Trump campaign continues to try to pretend like they have no ties to Project [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  2025, no matter how unsustainable that claim is. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=174.48s)]
*  Part of the findings of this poll are that even people who voted for Trump in 2020, they [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  by clear majority say they do not support the policies in Project 2025. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=185.48s)]
*  The same poll also took a snapshot of the electorate since Biden dropped out of the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  presidential race. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=194.12s)]
*  Back when this poll was taken in January, Trump led Biden nationally by four points [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=195.12s)]
*  with Kamala Harris now at the top of the ticket, though she leads Trump nationally by three [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=200.0s)]
*  points. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=204.8s)]
*  So a total turnaround there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=205.88s)]
*  And you're starting to see that same turnaround for Democrats in important swing states too. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  Late last month after Biden dropped out, Harris was tied with Trump in swing states, the swing [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=212.88s)]
*  states of Michigan and Pennsylvania. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=217.8s)]
*  Trump was up by one point in Wisconsin. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=219.4s)]
*  If you look at that same poll now in all three of those states, Harris leads Trump plus four. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=222.04s)]
*  It's a turnaround. It really is. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=229.8s)]
*  And it's nationally and it's in the important states. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=231.24s)]
*  And what this means, if you're the Republican ticket, is you're going to need a new strategy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=233.44s)]
*  You're either going to need to turn this campaign around to make people like you more. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=239.2s)]
*  Or you're going to need to figure out a way to win in a different way. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=243.64s)]
*  And I have been talking here on MSNBC with some urgency about this since around the time [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=247.64s)]
*  of the RNC because of what I'm seeing as what clearly appears to be an emerging strategy [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  for Republicans this year, which is to mess with the count of the vote, to have local [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=260.52s)]
*  Republican officials deny certification of the vote county by county. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=266.28s)]
*  You'll remember in 2020 when the violent mob was sicked on Congress, they were there [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  to block the certification of the vote nationwide. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=276.16s)]
*  Well, this time around, they are professionalizing the effort to block the certification of the vote. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=278.4s)]
*  They're systematizing it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=283.2s)]
*  They're starting with trained Republican officials at the local level in states all [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=284.72s)]
*  across the country so they can make a bigger swing at it this time. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=289.28s)]
*  And I have been talking a lot about this on MSNBC. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=294.24s)]
*  I hear from you guys a lot every time I do it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=296.96s)]
*  I've had a lot of feedback on this, but some real experts in this field are talking about it, too. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=299.36s)]
*  Not just about how worrying this problem is for November, but also what can be done to stop it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=305.52s)]
*  There's an urgent new report on the subject that I have been talking about for weeks here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=312.08s)]
*  We're revealing it here for the first time tonight. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  It's from CREW, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=319.36s)]
*  It's called Election Certification Under Threat, a legal roadmap to protect the 2024 election, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=323.28s)]
*  including from 35 officials who have refused to certify results. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=330.4s)]
*  The report tracks this sort of burgeoning crisis across eight different states so far, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=335.28s)]
*  where, in fact, there have been dozens of Republican local officials who have been [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=340.08s)]
*  refusing to sign off on proper tallies of lawful votes. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=344.0s)]
*  Is this a Republican strategy that holds any promise of essentially hamstringing the electoral [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=348.0s)]
*  count, of messing up the election and the administration of the election at the point [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=356.16s)]
*  of the counting of the votes, making official the vote tallies? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=363.6s)]
*  Do they have any real prospects of messing up the vote in November using these tactics [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=367.76000000000005s)]
*  that they have been essentially test driving in states all across the country in lower-profile [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=374.48s)]
*  elections? Joining us now is Noah Bookbinder. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  He's president and CEO of CREW, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Bookbinder, thanks very much for joining us. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=385.36s)]
*  Thanks for the advanced look at your report. I found it really interesting. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=387.04s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=390.56s)]
*  So I have been talking about this sort of with increasing concern for the last few weeks, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=393.36s)]
*  because it looks to me like Republicans at the county level and now starting to be at the state [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=397.36s)]
*  level are test driving an effort that they're going to try in November to effectively prevent [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  the election from being made official, to prevent the vote tallying to go forward in any sort of [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=411.68s)]
*  normal way. Do you think that is what they're trying to do? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=418.47999999999996s)]
*  I think it is absolutely a thing that is going to happen. I think that we've seen these county [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=422.56s)]
*  officials in multiple states attempt to stop the certification of votes in elections of, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=427.52s)]
*  in many cases, very little consequence. And they were doing it essentially as a run through [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=438.48s)]
*  for an election of a great deal of consequences, which is the one this fall. So I think there's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=442.72s)]
*  almost no question that this is going to happen. And it seems to be happening in a way this year [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  that is more systematic than it has in the past. So that's deeply, deeply concerning. I think the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=454.8s)]
*  good news is that it's clearly illegal in all of these states. And there are steps that can be [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=460.24s)]
*  taken to effectively halt it in all of these states. And you single out some of those in a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=465.84s)]
*  way that I think is very succinct and helpful. You write about state election boards, secretaries of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=473.28s)]
*  state attorneys, general local prosecutors should in advance of the election explicitly tell [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  county officials that they do not have discretion to refuse to certify the election, warn them in [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=484.96s)]
*  advance that they may be treading into essentially criminal law territory if they do this. We've seen [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=490.8s)]
*  that happen in a couple of states already. That's right. In Michigan, the secretary of state and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=496.08s)]
*  other officials have been very clear that the law provides for legitimate ways to challenge elections [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=501.76s)]
*  if there are questions about fraud or questions about the count. County certification is not one [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=509.04s)]
*  of those ways. It is essentially a ministerial process. It's not a way to challenge results. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  In Michigan, officials have told these county officials, you can't do this. And if you do, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=520.48s)]
*  there will be consequences. And I think that both potentially could deter some of these people from [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=525.9200000000001s)]
*  trying this. And it also puts them on notice so that if they do try to disrupt the election [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=532.4s)]
*  and they are prosecuted or they are challenged civilly, they won't be able to say they didn't [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=540.24s)]
*  realize they couldn't do this. So that's something that we'd like to see in all of these states. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=544.72s)]
*  And again, we've seen it happen in Michigan, but we haven't necessarily seen that happen [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  even in every state where it has already been tried, let alone in states where [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=555.04s)]
*  officials don't yet know if Republicans are going to try it. It does seem like there are sort of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=560.72s)]
*  different tactics legally available to state officials in various states. In some cases, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=564.8s)]
*  you can have a court essentially order public officials to do this. In some states, you can [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=571.36s)]
*  have the state election board take over the job of a county election official if they're refusing [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=575.84s)]
*  to do their job. In other places, you can have a local official remove. But there isn't the same [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=580.24s)]
*  playbook available legally in every state. It does seem like the one thing that every state could do [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=585.44s)]
*  right now is give advice to every elections board in the state, get it on record to every elections [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=593.2800000000001s)]
*  board in the state that they should not do this and it's not within their rights to try it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=599.6s)]
*  That's absolutely right. I mean, there we've seen in different states a number of these different [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=606.24s)]
*  responses work. We've seen in New Mexico and Nevada where they've gone to court and gotten orders [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=611.6s)]
*  to ordering these county officials to certify the vote and that's worked. But the reason why [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=616.72s)]
*  we're putting this report out is to say, here's the law in this state, here's what can be done [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=625.6s)]
*  so that state officials can get out there and warn these folks and be ready to act. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=630.88s)]
*  In a lot of states, I think the signs have been positive. In a state like Georgia, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=637.92s)]
*  it's very alarming because you have the state election board going in just the opposite direction [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=642.4799999999999s)]
*  and even though the law is very clear, you have the state election board actually trying to say [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  that county officials can refuse to certify. That's definitely a place to really keep an eye on. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=652.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01_HKARXWOM&t=659.92s)]
