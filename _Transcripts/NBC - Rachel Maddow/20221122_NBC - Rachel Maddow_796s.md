# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Nov. 21
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE)
*  Joining us now are Matthew Haynes and Nick Grzecha. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=0.0s)]
*  They are the co-owners of Club Q, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=3.84s)]
*  where this mass shooting happens. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=7.04s)]
*  Mr. Haynes, Mr. Grzecha, I am so sorry [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=9.76s)]
*  for what you have been through. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=11.88s)]
*  Thank you for being willing to be with us tonight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=12.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=16.88s)]
*  Let me just ask you first, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=18.44s)]
*  I've tried to summarize the basics of what we know [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=19.68s)]
*  about what happened and what we've been told by officials. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=22.72s)]
*  Is there anything that I've gotten wrong [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=25.32s)]
*  or anything else that you can add to us [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=26.96s)]
*  that you think the country should know tonight [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=28.92s)]
*  about what happened and what the response was like [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  once this horrible incident got underway? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=33.28s)]
*  I think what people need to remember the most [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  are the innocent victims. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  They're no longer with us tonight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=44.6s)]
*  The 18 people that were injured, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=47.28s)]
*  the countless more people that have trauma injuries. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=49.72s)]
*  That's what I think everybody, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=54.32000000000001s)]
*  that's the biggest part tonight is memorandum. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=56.08s)]
*  Absolutely, that's what we see behind us. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=59.36s)]
*  That's what we see. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=61.24s)]
*  I will add that we've had tremendous community support. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=63.6s)]
*  We've had tremendous support [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=67.56s)]
*  from the local Colorado Springs Police Department. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=69.12s)]
*  We've had tremendous support from the mayor [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=71.88s)]
*  and all of the state officials. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=74.6s)]
*  So we couldn't have asked for more support. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=77.36s)]
*  The reaction that night was outstanding. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=81.28s)]
*  We had so many police officers, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=86.0s)]
*  we had such a response. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=87.9s)]
*  We've had a very good history [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=90.14s)]
*  with Colorado Springs Police over the years [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=91.58000000000001s)]
*  and it just really shone that particular night, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=93.98s)]
*  that tragic night. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  I know that two of the victims who lost their lives [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  on Saturday night were your employees, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  Daniel and Derek. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=103.38000000000001s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about them? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=104.26s)]
*  They were wonderful. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=108.94s)]
*  They were, their mother employees, their family. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=111.18s)]
*  They, yes, they were the heart of what Club Q is. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=114.54s)]
*  They are what most of our customers [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=119.3s)]
*  would have had experienced. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=123.5s)]
*  They both were incredibly passionate. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=124.9s)]
*  They worked amazingly well together. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=128.54s)]
*  They were great friends. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=130.98s)]
*  These are our true family members. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=133.38s)]
*  They're the Nick and I's family members [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=136.02s)]
*  and so many people behind us. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=138.3s)]
*  So many lives that they've changed [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=140.22s)]
*  and I think I cannot do their memory justice [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=142.42s)]
*  when you look on their Facebook pages [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=147.38s)]
*  and you look what everyone else [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=149.01999999999998s)]
*  and all the individual experiences people have had [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  with these two wonderful men. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=153.22s)]
*  It tells an amazing story [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=156.22s)]
*  and it's what the last 20 years of Club Q has been about [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=158.06s)]
*  and not just Club Q, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=162.26s)]
*  but they embody what this type of bar is, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=163.54s)]
*  what a community bar is and what community really is. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=167.77999999999997s)]
*  They were amazing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=173.26s)]
*  I wanted to say a lot of what we're learning as a country [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=175.22s)]
*  learns of this story and learns more about Club Q [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=179.66s)]
*  and learns about what happened on Saturday night. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=182.38s)]
*  I think one of the things that people are really struck by [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=184.26s)]
*  is that all sorts of different people were there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=186.26s)]
*  Definitely, gay people there, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  queer people there, transgender people there, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=191.66s)]
*  also straight people there with their families, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=194.14s)]
*  people in multi-generational groups enjoying the show, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  it just felt like the most diverse, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=201.74s)]
*  imaginable group of people there [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=205.06s)]
*  and people who have come out in support [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=207.82s)]
*  of what happened there tonight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=209.34s)]
*  And I wondered if you could speak to that a little bit, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=212.18s)]
*  especially given how much political hate [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=215.22s)]
*  has been directed at the queer community [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=218.18s)]
*  and particularly at the trans community [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=220.1s)]
*  over these past couple of years from the political right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=222.1s)]
*  That is what Club Q is. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=227.66s)]
*  That is what a queer space is. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=229.57999999999998s)]
*  It's a space that all of these people can gather together [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=231.7s)]
*  without hate, without prejudice to feel safe. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  And that's every night at Club Q. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=243.34s)]
*  It's every night at every queer bar across the world. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=245.54s)]
*  And that's the devastating thing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=249.7s)]
*  is this community has now lost their space. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=251.66s)]
*  But the community that they've built inside that space [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  can't be taken away. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=258.3s)]
*  We talk about hate, but for all the hate, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=260.54s)]
*  there is still so much love. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  And that's what we've had in this bar. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=265.7s)]
*  And that's what the Saturday night was a representation [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=269.1s)]
*  of what every night is there. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=272.66s)]
*  It is full of a community of people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=274.38s)]
*  And when I say community, I don't mean just gay people. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  It's all of the allies. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  It's all of the people and all of the support we have. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=281.06s)]
*  This is 2022 after all. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  And we have come a long way than where we started [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  20 years ago here, building this business. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  And so there's a lot of victories we've all had, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=292.90000000000003s)]
*  and we do receive so much support from so many walks of life. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  Matthew Haynes, Nick, or Zecha, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=302.34000000000003s)]

*  thank you for being with us. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  I know it's an incredibly difficult time. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate you being here tonight. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=310.94s)]

*  You've learned stuff from it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=350.3s)]
*  I have. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=351.38s)]
*  And what's amazing about it, by the way, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  is to hear these people's voices. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=353.5s)]
*  I know you've talked about this on the show before, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=354.9s)]
*  but normal Lindeen, that's a voice that sticks with you. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=356.38s)]
*  But even hearing John Rogge, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=358.98s)]
*  the Department of Justice prosecutor [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=360.26s)]
*  you were just talking about, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  I'd never heard his voice before. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. It's amazing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=363.78s)]
*  You know, it's funny when we've been, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=364.74s)]
*  since the podcast has been out there, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=366.3s)]
*  one of the recurring conversations I've had [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  is that people even involved in the news business [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=370.26s)]
*  have come to me and say, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=372.94s)]
*  where'd you find these actors? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=373.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=374.94s)]
*  And I'm like, oh no, no, no, this is all archival tape. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=375.78s)]
*  It really does, like, you can't believe that this stuff is, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=378.86s)]
*  I guess also you kind of want it to be ancient history [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=381.38s)]
*  so you can't believe there's tape of them, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=383.98s)]
*  but it's not that ancient. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=385.58s)]
*  I mean, the 40s is history that we can reach to. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=387.06s)]
*  We all know people who are alive when this happened. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=389.74s)]
*  And there just aren't that many instances [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=392.7s)]
*  in American history where you get people [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=395.14s)]
*  put on trial for sedition. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=396.34s)]
*  So the number of points on the number line, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=398.85999999999996s)]
*  there just aren't that many to connect. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=402.78s)]
*  I have to ask you, and I don't want to assume that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=404.26s)]
*  because you just said those nice things [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  because you're in the podcast [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  that you agree with every point of it, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=410.26s)]
*  but let me ask if you agree with that basic thesis [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=411.65999999999997s)]
*  that the justice department clearly has a role, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=414.62s)]
*  but they shouldn't be seen as the silver bullet, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=418.65999999999997s)]
*  that there have been real weaknesses [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=420.62s)]
*  in the way they've approached these things in the past. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=422.06s)]
*  I think that's absolutely right. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, one thing that I think you point out well [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=424.65999999999997s)]
*  in the podcast I talked about in the book as well [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=426.46000000000004s)]
*  is that a lot of the activity we're talking about [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=428.1s)]
*  up until the point where people are actually committing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=430.14000000000004s)]
*  sedition or other crimes is constitutionally protected. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=432.5s)]
*  First Amendment, Second Amendment, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=435.62s)]
*  a lot of the groups that we're talking about here [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=437.06s)]
*  are saying really nasty things about people. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=439.26s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  Most people would agree with that, but it's not a crime. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=442.18s)]
*  Even some of the more militarized groups [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=444.58000000000004s)]
*  when they're training with weapons and things like that, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=446.14s)]
*  that still protected Second Amendment activity [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=448.26s)]
*  in a lot of ways. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=450.22s)]
*  And so I think the important point here [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=451.06s)]
*  is that the law has a role, certainly, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=453.14s)]
*  but there's a wider civil society role [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=457.18s)]
*  in sort of policing the spectrum of extremism [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=458.42s)]
*  and the spectrum of our politics. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=461.14s)]
*  And in terms of that civil society role, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=462.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that I was really heartened by, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=464.38s)]
*  and for anybody who's partially listened to the podcast [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=468.14s)]
*  and hasn't got to the end, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=470.74s)]
*  there's ways in which it has a bad ending, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=472.02000000000004s)]
*  but one of the, I think, surprising good endings [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=473.46000000000004s)]
*  is that there's all these members of Congress, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=476.06s)]
*  including members of Congress who are really powerful, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=478.22s)]
*  who are powerful enough to go to the attorney general [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=480.46000000000004s)]
*  and get a prosecutor fired, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=483.1s)]
*  to go to the president and get another prosecutor fired, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=484.38s)]
*  to get a Justice Department report buried [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=487.42s)]
*  that was otherwise gonna be public. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=489.5s)]
*  I mean, members of Congress with a ton of sway. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=490.98s)]
*  Nevertheless, when their activities around this stuff [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=494.58s)]
*  come to light, the voters throw them out. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=496.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=498.26s)]
*  And it's sort of surprising, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=499.1s)]
*  given how powerful some of them were. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=500.3s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=502.18s)]
*  And you see some of these names [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=503.0s)]
*  are household names in this period, right? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=503.98s)]
*  Senator Burton K. Wheeler, who's alluded to, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=505.94s)]
*  this was one of the leading lights [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=508.06s)]
*  of the progressive movement at one time, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=509.3s)]
*  one of the leading lights of the Democratic Party [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=511.06s)]
*  being bandied about as a potential presidential contender [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=513.3s)]
*  even in 1940, when no one knows [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=515.74s)]
*  if Roosevelt's running for his third term. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=517.3399999999999s)]
*  So this is a man who has obtained semi-legendary status. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=519.42s)]
*  And what's interesting to consider is [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=522.62s)]
*  if he had died, perhaps, in the late 1930s, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=524.14s)]
*  might well be a venerated figure today in American politics. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=526.8599999999999s)]
*  But because of what happens later on, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=529.5799999999999s)]
*  he loses his seat in 1946, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=531.62s)]
*  the Democratic primary reputation is tanked. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=533.54s)]
*  So how do you square that in terms of accountability? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=536.4599999999999s)]
*  Obviously, this is the resonant point [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=539.66s)]
*  that looms large for us now, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=541.2199999999999s)]
*  given the challenges that we've got, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=542.46s)]
*  the sedition trial now, pending potential charges [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  against the president for his role in this. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=546.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, you get somebody like John Rogge, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=548.5400000000001s)]
*  like the prosecutor that preceded him, William Maloney, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=551.46s)]
*  bringing these cases in court, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=553.96s)]
*  they don't end up resulting in convictions, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=556.6600000000001s)]
*  even though they implicate [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=559.34s)]
*  these powerful members of Congress. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=560.74s)]
*  Certainly, those members of Congress [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=562.34s)]
*  never find themselves in the dock, let alone in jail. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=563.7800000000001s)]
*  But you do also get them voted out. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=567.98s)]
*  It's a civil society form of accountability [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=570.42s)]
*  that's driven essentially by journalism, by activism, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=573.06s)]
*  by people coming to know what they did [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=576.5s)]
*  and judging them for it, even though they're not locked up? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=578.54s)]
*  Ultimately, this is about the voters, right? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=581.9s)]
*  I mean, there is a ton of journalism done on this. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=583.38s)]
*  There's incredibly hard-hitting ads [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=585.4599999999999s)]
*  that are run against these candidates [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=587.3s)]
*  when they're up for reelection [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=588.5s)]
*  at various points during the war. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=589.5s)]
*  But ultimately, this is about the voters. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=590.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think when I was doing this research initially, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=592.74s)]
*  my first reaction was, why isn't this story better known? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=595.3s)]
*  I think you've had the same reaction doing the podcast. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=597.2199999999999s)]
*  But also, I think when I got to the end of it [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=599.5s)]
*  and sort of realized that there was sort of a form [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=601.4200000000001s)]
*  of almost justice in this way [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=603.9000000000001s)]
*  against these individuals who engaged [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=606.02s)]
*  in pretty bad behavior in the 1930s and 40s, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=607.6600000000001s)]
*  that was heartening, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  that the voters did ultimately punish [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=611.26s)]
*  virtually all of the figures that are included in this. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  Not all of them, virtually all of them. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=615.7800000000001s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=618.4200000000001s)]
*  I mean, maybe there'll be an ultra-season two someday. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=619.82s)]
*  I don't know, and I know that your research [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=621.94s)]
*  on this era continues. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=623.58s)]
*  But one of the things that happens [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=625.1s)]
*  to the sedition defendants who aren't convicted [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=626.4200000000001s)]
*  and who kind of melt back into the sauce of American society [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=628.74s)]
*  is that some of them at least end up providing [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=631.74s)]
*  some of the core, really radical basis [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=634.38s)]
*  for a very far-right part of the American, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=637.7s)]
*  pro-fascist, pro-Nazi, in many cases, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=641.74s)]
*  Holocaust denying part of what becomes the next era [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=643.94s)]
*  of far-right American politics. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=647.26s)]
*  I mean, the members of Congress who are associated [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=649.1400000000001s)]
*  with these folks get voted out and become obscure figures [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=651.0600000000001s)]
*  and die in obscurity. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=653.38s)]
*  But some of these defendants end up becoming part [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=654.98s)]
*  of stuff that is really scary in terms of what comes next [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=658.42s)]
*  on the American far, far right. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=660.86s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=662.26s)]
*  I mean, some of these figures become associated [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=663.1s)]
*  with people like Gerald L.K. Smith, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=664.42s)]
*  who I know you mentioned in today's episode, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=665.74s)]
*  a very, very anti-Semitic inheritor [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=667.98s)]
*  of the Huey Long sort of machine in Louisiana [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=671.06s)]
*  and also this sort of rabble-rousing style of speaking. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=673.78s)]
*  You know, Huey Long is a figure until the late 1960s, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=677.18s)]
*  early 70s in American politics. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=679.74s)]
*  And some of these figures are closely associated [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=681.74s)]
*  with his move. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=683.82s)]
*  And Elizabeth Dilling, another figure you talk about [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=684.66s)]
*  in the podcast, I mean, she's active until the late 1960s [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=687.34s)]
*  when she dies as sort of a red-baiting conspiracy theorist. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=690.34s)]
*  So absolutely, I mean, many of the sort of leading lights [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=693.86s)]
*  of this movement politically, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=697.14s)]
*  especially in the America First Committee, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=699.22s)]
*  they pay a pretty steep political price. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=700.82s)]
*  Their careers are mostly over by the 1950s. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=702.58s)]
*  But the rank and file sort of melt back into society. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=705.1800000000001s)]
*  And that's one question I always ask myself [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=707.62s)]
*  in this research that I don't have an answer for yet [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=709.4200000000001s)]
*  is what happens to everybody else? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=711.1800000000001s)]
*  We were talking hundreds of thousands of people [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=713.22s)]
*  who are involved in these things. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=714.74s)]
*  Yeah, America First Committee had a million members, right? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=715.94s)]
*  A million members. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=717.98s)]
*  And Father Coughlin, right? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=718.82s)]
*  The most popular radio host of all time. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=719.6600000000001s)]
*  30 million listeners a week by some estimates. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=721.62s)]
*  What happens to those people? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=724.22s)]
*  Yeah, well, you'll know it before I do. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=725.2600000000001s)]
*  And hopefully I'll be right there on your heels. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=729.1400000000001s)]
*  Bradley Hart, I really appreciate all that you did [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=731.86s)]
*  to help us tell this story. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=734.34s)]
*  Your work in this as a historian is absolutely, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=736.9000000000001s)]
*  absolutely totally invaluable. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=739.82s)]
*  Again, where is it? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=741.62s)]
*  Bradley Hart's book is called [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=743.74s)]
*  Hitler's American Friends, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=744.94s)]
*  the Third Reich Supporters in the United States. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=746.66s)]
*  Sir, thank you. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=748.78s)]
*  Thank you very much. Congratulations on this. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=749.62s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=750.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=751.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHMhRK-GyE&t=781.5s)]
