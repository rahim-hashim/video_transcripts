# Boy Who Fled Ukraine Alone Reunites With Mother In Slovakia
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M)
*  Last week we introduced you to 11 year old Hassan, a Ukrainian refugee who was forced to flee his home to escape Russia's assault. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=0.0s)]
*  So far about one and a half million children have fled Ukraine and according to the United Nations, for almost every second this war continues, another child becomes a refugee. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=8.0s)]
*  But Hassan made his 600 mile voyage alone, traveling from southeast Ukraine to the Slovakian border with nothing but a backpack, a plastic bag and this phone number written on the back of his hand. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=18.0s)]
*  It was that phone number that connected him to siblings in Slovakia. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=31.0s)]
*  Now according to the Slovak Ministry of the Interior, Hassan, quote, won over everyone with his smile, fearlessness and determination, worthy of a real hero, end quote. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=35.0s)]
*  But this was not the first time war displaced Hassan and his family. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=45.0s)]
*  The first time was about 11 years ago when he was just a baby. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=49.0s)]
*  Hassan and his siblings had to flee to escape violent conflict in their home country of Syria. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=53.0s)]
*  Russia, of course, intervened in the Syrian conflict with airstrikes to help the Assad regime, striking both rebel held military outposts and civilians. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=58.0s)]
*  At the time, Hassan and his family fled to his mother's native country, Ukraine. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=69.0s)]
*  They have not seen their father since they escaped Syria. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=73.0s)]
*  The family says he disappeared in the fighting after Hassan successfully escaped Russian violence again. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=76.0s)]
*  This time in Ukraine, his mother, Julia, expressed her gratitude to Slovakia in a video saying, quote, I am very grateful that they saved the life of my child in your small country. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=82.0s)]
*  There are people with big hearts. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=93.0s)]
*  Julia said she had to stay in Ukraine to take care of her mother who could not move on her own. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=95.0s)]
*  But as the intensity of the Russian assault increased, Julia decided she had to just take her mother and their dog and try to make it to Slovakia. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=100.0s)]
*  And she succeeded. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=108.0s)]
*  This week, she was reunited with her children with the help of Slovak police officials. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=110.0s)]
*  She got to greet each of her kids with a hug after war threatened to separate this family a second time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=115.0s)]
*  This was the look on Hassan's face. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=121.0s)]
*  When after weeks apart, he finally got to hold his mother again. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=123.0s)]
*  Pure joy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=127.0s)]
*  Now that the family is safely back together, the Slovak police force says Hassan's older brother is looking to secure accommodations for the family and set up schooling for his siblings. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=129.0s)]
*  They are beginning a new life together, defying the threat that war poses to all families caught in its path. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CCKNo3JQ4M&t=138.0s)]
