# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 13
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM)
*  We have a simple and very powerful concept in the U.S. judicial system. Prosecutors in the courts [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=0.0s)]
*  are not supposed to air accusations against anyone without giving the accused person the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=4.64s)]
*  opportunity to refute the allegations and to defend themselves. It's a pillar of American [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=10.4s)]
*  justice that is due process, that is innocent until proven guilty, that is fair play. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=16.8s)]
*  And in Fulton County, Georgia, the district attorney there, Fannie Wallace, cited that need [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=23.04s)]
*  to be fair to any future defendants when she told a judge last month that she did not want [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=27.36s)]
*  release to the public a special grand jury's report on its investigation into 2020 election [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=33.76s)]
*  interference by Donald Trump and his associates. District attorney Wallace was basically saying, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=40.8s)]
*  I know there is this grand jury report. I know that special grand jury said they want their [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  report released to the public, but I say, no, don't do it. Don't give it to the public. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=51.76s)]
*  She's basically saying, wait for me to file indictments in court or not. Let the allegations [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=56.96s)]
*  be aired that way against people who will then be given a fair shot to defend themselves against [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=62.08s)]
*  those charges in court. Otherwise we should keep them secret. Well, today we know the judge hearing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=65.76s)]
*  this case agreed with her argument in part. The judge in the case ruled against releasing the full [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=72.56s)]
*  grand jury report at this juncture, except he decided he does want to release three sections of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=80.08s)]
*  it. The introduction, the conclusion, and this other part, which is interesting and sort of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=86.48s)]
*  unexpected. It's what he describes as the part of the grand jury's report in which the grand jury [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=94.24s)]
*  expresses its concerns about witnesses potentially lying to them under oath. The judge says that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=98.8s)]
*  section can be released because it doesn't name individual names of people who the grand jury [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  is accusing of lying. The judge says in his ruling, quote, because the grand jury does not [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=109.92s)]
*  identify those witnesses, that conclusion may be publicly disclosed at this time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=115.44s)]
*  But it's two bottom lines from this judge's ruling today. First, material from this report, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=121.84s)]
*  at least the introduction, the conclusion, and this part about people lying under oath, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=127.76s)]
*  it's going to be coming out to the public as of Thursday this week. And secondly, we know this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=131.68s)]
*  also from the judge's ruling. It does seem crystal clear from his wording today that the grand jury [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=137.36s)]
*  has recommended that people should be indicted under Georgia state law in this case. This again [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  from Judge McBurney's order today, quote, the final report provided the district attorney with [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=149.68s)]
*  exactly what she requested, a roster of who should or should not be indicted and for what, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=154.56s)]
*  in relation to the conduct and aftermath of the 2020 general election in Georgia. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=160.08s)]
*  Victor Orban in Hungary, just like Vladimir Putin in Russia, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=165.04s)]
*  he also led his country into a full blown moral panic about gay people and trans people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=170.56s)]
*  And in both countries, they use that in particular as a way to not just hurt and scapegoat queer [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  people. They used it as a way to consolidate yet more control over the media and over schools [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=184.0s)]
*  at all levels. In Orban's case, he then led a moral panic about schools themselves, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=191.2s)]
*  declaring war on the one truly prestigious internationally influential graduate school [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=197.44s)]
*  in Hungary, a school called Central European University. Central European University is very [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=202.16s)]
*  influential and important in Hungary. It had an important publishing house, a really important [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  library, a very important and highly ranked law school. Victor Orban couldn't stand that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=212.32s)]
*  He demonized it. He forced that university out of Hungary altogether in 2019. This past year, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=218.08s)]
*  he took control of 11 more universities. And then after making his way, eating his way through the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  media and eating his way through academia, just like Putin, he then ate the judiciary too. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=234.0s)]
*  Orban forced out judges in huge numbers and then appointed all their replacements. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=241.84s)]
*  And then he just created a whole new court system in which he appointed everyone in it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=247.68s)]
*  And they all report to him, including him deciding which cases go to which judges on an individual [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=252.0s)]
*  level on his own say so. Once he got complete control of the judiciary, he wrote himself a new [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=258.96s)]
*  constitution in which he gave himself the power to do all the things that had previously been [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=266.72s)]
*  struck down as unconstitutional when his country used to have real courts. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=271.28s)]
*  It is easier to see it. It is easier for us as Americans to see these patterns [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  when they're farther away, right? When we can see them in other countries, particularly when [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  we can see them happening simultaneously in different countries that are all run by authoritarian [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=287.11999999999995s)]
*  leaders. And the patterns aren't that hard to discern because you see the same ones in history [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=292.55999999999995s)]
*  that you see in modern life. All authoritarians kind of do all the same things. Authoritarian [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=298.4s)]
*  rule is a pretty simple thing, right? Basic idea of authoritarian rule is I'm in charge, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=304.08s)]
*  nobody else gets a say. If that's your goal, your roadmap basically only has one road on it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  Set about making sure that nobody else has a say. Set about undermining and disempowering any other [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=317.52s)]
*  institution, any other entity that might challenge you or tell the truth about what you're doing. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=323.68s)]
*  Undermine it, disempower it, take it over, shut it down, ultimately kill it off. It's the same [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=331.6s)]
*  pattern everywhere. It's the same playbook everywhere. And that is why it is unnerving [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=338.08s)]
*  to see elements of the American right going for it in the small ways where they can too. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  They can't do it federally, but they're doing it in the states wherever they can, right? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=352.64s)]
*  I mean, what's called Central European University in Viktor Orbán's Hungary [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=358.4s)]
*  might reasonably be called the New College of Florida here in the United States, where the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=363.2s)]
*  ambitious, hard right Republican governor of that state moved quickly from stoking a moral [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=369.12s)]
*  panic about gay people and trans people to asserting ideological control of education broadly. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=374.8s)]
*  And then demonizing and taking over one scapegoat college in particular. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=383.2s)]
*  You might also see some of this at work just today in West Virginia. NPR reporting on how Republican [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  governor Jim Justice in West Virginia has declared war on West Virginia public broadcasting, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=395.44s)]
*  which is increasingly important as a news source in West Virginia, particularly as the news business [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=402.24s)]
*  has led to the collapse of lots of local news gathering operations. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=406.8s)]
*  But at West Virginia Public Broadcasting, Jim Justice has decided that's got to go too. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  So he's gotten rid of the professional leadership. He installed his own communications director as [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=416.0s)]
*  the new CEO. And now they've started firing reporters who have reported on scandals and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=421.36s)]
*  failures in Governor Justice's administration. And I could describe that West Virginia situation as [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  a scandal. I think for most Americans who value the idea of a free and independent press, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  it would be seen as a scandal. But just watch if what Jim Justice is doing with the media [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=439.28s)]
*  in West Virginia, if that starts getting national attention, just watch other Republican governors [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=445.52s)]
*  will see what he's doing and try to emulate it themselves. Because this is what's in style right [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=450.08s)]
*  now on the American far right. It is a race to outdo each other with this stuff now. And we know [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=455.2s)]
*  where it ends. We've seen this playbook lots of different places. We can see it all around the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=464.4s)]
*  world. As we reported here just a couple of weeks ago, Putin has just put his foot on the neck [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=469.35999999999996s)]
*  of one of the last remaining Russian language news organizations, an independent news organization [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=478.32s)]
*  called Medusa. Medusa wasn't even able to operate inside Russia at all. They're based outside Russia, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=483.44s)]
*  but they cover Russia and they publish in the Russian language. Putin has just declared that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=489.28s)]
*  even though they are not in Russia, Medusa is not allowed inside Russia anymore. And beyond that, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  he's declared them to be effectively almost like a terrorist organization, at least a criminal [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=502.4s)]
*  enterprise. Putin has legally branded the news organization Medusa an undesirable organization, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=507.76s)]
*  which means anyone in Russia who reads anything from Medusa or shares it online or gives them [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=513.76s)]
*  money, subscribes to them, donates, even anybody who gives an interview to a Medusa reporter for [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=519.28s)]
*  their reporting. They could be arrested for that too. That could be seen as a criminal act. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=524.64s)]
*  And as we reported here a couple of weeks ago, the Medusa staff is defiant. They're scared, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=531.2s)]
*  but defiant. Their staff put out a statement in response to this action by Putin saying, quote, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  we'd like to tell you that our new undesirable status doesn't worry us that it means nothing, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=540.8s)]
*  but that would be untrue. We are afraid. We fear for our readers and for those who have [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  collaborated with Medusa for many years. We fear for our loved ones and our friends, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=550.56s)]
*  but we believe in what we do. We believe in freedom of speech. We believe in a democratic Russia. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=555.28s)]
*  The stronger the pressure, the tougher we will resist it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=560.16s)]
*  That was two weeks ago. And indeed tonight, two weeks hence, two weeks after we first brought you [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=563.52s)]
*  that report, Medusa is still there. They still exist. I mean, tonight you can look at them [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=571.6s)]
*  online medusa.io. They offer English language translations of their reporting. Here they are [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=576.16s)]
*  tonight online publishing independent accounts of the death toll of Russian soldiers in Ukraine, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=582.56s)]
*  which of course is something you will never get from Russian state media. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=588.48s)]
*  Here's something they posted earlier today, an account of a report on Putin being too afraid [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=592.16s)]
*  now to travel by air. He is now reportedly only traveling by heavily armored train traveling by [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=598.16s)]
*  train instead of by plane means that nobody can monitor his flight data. They also have reportedly [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=605.84s)]
*  painted this train so that it's a stealth operation. It now looks just like a regular Russian [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=611.36s)]
*  railways train, except you can tell it's the special Putin train because it has two extra axles [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=618.4s)]
*  to deal with all the extra weight because it is heavily armored. And also all the other trains [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=623.76s)]
*  have to move and get out of its way because it doesn't stop at any stations. You can find that [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=628.48s)]
*  report tonight at medusa.io. Medusa is still there. They are still working, still piecing it [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=634.24s)]
*  together under threat. As every single independent news organization in Russia has now been shut down [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=639.68s)]
*  or criminalized or forced out of that country. And this is the authoritarian playbook, right? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=646.8s)]
*  I mean, this isn't just Russia. This is authoritarianism. You can't have total [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=653.12s)]
*  dictatorial control of a country as long as that country still has, you know, an independent source [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=657.68s)]
*  of fact or information or perspective or God forbid, scrutiny or criticism of the dear leader. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=664.4799999999999s)]
*  If you're going to have unitary control of a country, you must get rid of the free press. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=669.52s)]
*  It is a systematic thing for authoritarians and it is the same for authoritarians everywhere. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=676.96s)]
*  I mean, you might remember a couple of years ago, remember the Nobel Peace Prize a couple of years [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=682.48s)]
*  ago, went to two people who didn't know each other, even though they do the same type of [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=685.6800000000001s)]
*  work in two different parts of the world. It went to an editor from Russia, the man on the right, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=690.96s)]
*  and an editor from the Philippines, the woman on the left. These two shared the Nobel Peace Prize [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=695.6s)]
*  in 2021. Well, by the following year, by 2022 in the Philippines, her news organization was ordered [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=700.96s)]
*  shut down by the Duterte administration. It was ordered shut down in June. By July, she personally [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=708.0s)]
*  was sentenced to prison in the Philippines. The action was even quicker in Russia. Again, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=714.4s)]
*  this is the editor of the Philippines entity and that Russian entity sharing that Nobel Peace Prize [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=720.16s)]
*  in 2021. By March 2022, his Russian news organization, Novaya Gazeta, was forced out of Russia. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=726.48s)]
*  That was in March 2022. In April 2022, he was attacked physically on a train. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=735.92s)]
*  The US government said it was the work of Russian intelligence. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=744.48s)]
*  Dmitry Muratov then put his Nobel Peace Prize medal up for auction with the proceeds to benefit [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=746.8s)]
*  Ukrainian refugees from the war. He raised over a hundred million dollars doing that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=752.4799999999999s)]
*  But attacking the press, attacking any source of information, of expertise, authority, anything [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  that can rationally offer an authoritative, credible perspective other than the fact that [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=770.16s)]
*  you're the leader, you've got to get rid of that. That's the playbook. I think it's much easier for [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=775.92s)]
*  us to see this far away than it is for us to see it close up. Particularly when you can see it [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=781.12s)]
*  happening not just in one other country, you can see it happening basically the same way in a whole [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=786.24s)]
*  bunch of different countries where the only thing those countries have in common is that they have [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=791.2s)]
*  authoritarian leaders. You see attacks on the press in Russia under their authoritarian leader [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=794.72s)]
*  and you see attacks on the press in the Philippines under their authoritarian leaders. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=799.92s)]
*  You also see it in Hungary under their authoritarian leader. In Hungary, the way their [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=804.0799999999999s)]
*  leader Viktor Orbán did it was he got his party and oligarchs and loyalists close to him to just [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=809.36s)]
*  forcibly take over ownership of about 80% of the media, 80% of the entire media landscape in the [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=815.8399999999999s)]
*  nation of Hungary. Then the remaining 20%, the remaining independent press that they didn't [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  outright own, they started just arbitrarily revoking the licenses of those entities to operate, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=831.04s)]
*  calling them what else? Fake news. These protests in Israel today are because the far right leader [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=838.0799999999999s)]
*  there has just proposed effectively that he's going to take over the judiciary. He says the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  courts in his country are, in his words, quote, out of control and the courts are going to take [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=852.88s)]
*  control and the courts need to be controlled. And so his party is now advancing legislation [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=859.76s)]
*  in which he will control the courts, just like Viktor Orbán did in Hungary. Because of course, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=865.92s)]
*  an independent judiciary is just as necessary to a democracy as it is anathema to a leader [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=872.48s)]
*  with authoritarian designs. Now, the personal context here in Israel is that the prime minister [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=878.48s)]
*  who's trying to do this is personally facing serious corruption charges in the courts. So of [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=887.28s)]
*  course, he thinks the courts are out of control and they must be brought under his purview. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=892.8s)]
*  That's also why you see the protests saying things like, crime minister and no one is above the law. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=898.16s)]
*  They see the authoritarian would-be leader of Israel, right? They see that's their accusation. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=904.8s)]
*  They see him as essentially moving to get rid of the independent judiciary in that country, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=911.2s)]
*  both to consolidate his own power and to save himself from his own legal liability. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=917.6s)]
*  Putting that pillar of democracy on the chopping block, both because he wishes to put it on the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=925.04s)]
*  chopping block, but also because it serves him personally in a very short-term and transactional [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=931.2s)]
*  way. That's what has led to all the protests. That's what has led to the accusations of creeping [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=935.92s)]
*  authoritarianism from that leader in Israel. And again, I do think it's easier to see these things [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=942.0799999999999s)]
*  when they are far away from us, right? To see how similar they look between all these disparate other [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=949.12s)]
*  countries as they, you know, slough off democracy one after the other with or without a fight in the [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  streets. But it's also for us at home, I think it is worth us watching it in other countries, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=959.76s)]
*  to learn the pattern, but also to recognize the signs that we're not immune. Because in this [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=967.36s)]
*  country, our most prominent far-right leader has been, of course, subjected to multiple criminal [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=972.8s)]
*  and counterintelligence investigations by the FBI and the U.S. Justice Department. And so we have [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=980.24s)]
*  seen and we have gobbled over the past several years as he started waging and then escalated and [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=985.36s)]
*  escalated and escalated further his attacks on the Justice Department and on the FBI in particular, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=990.88s)]
*  to the point where not just him, but his party now considers the FBI effectively to be an enemy, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=997.12s)]
*  and they attack it at every turn, and they're talking about defunding the FBI, and they talk [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1002.96s)]
*  about wanting its leaders arrested. I mean, that has been amazing enough for something to happen in [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1007.36s)]
*  American politics. It still almost feels like it's something we're watching happening in another [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1012.24s)]
*  country, these Trump mega Republican attacks on the FBI and the Justice Department. Right? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1016.24s)]
*  As Trump has been under investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department, he has trained his [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1023.6800000000001s)]
*  sights on the FBI and the Justice Department. But where is that going? Because we now know that [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1028.64s)]
*  three days from now, on Thursday of this week, former president and current presidential [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1038.08s)]
*  candidate Donald Trump, as of Thursday this week, is likely to understand that he's no longer just [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1043.36s)]
*  facing scrutiny and investigation from law enforcement agencies. He is likely, not certain, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  but likely to find out this week that he's about to be under court scrutiny as well. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1056.3999999999999s)]
*  Today, a judge in Georgia announced that the special grand jury investigating Trump's efforts [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1062.96s)]
*  to stay in power after losing reelection in 2020, the report on the special grand jury's [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1067.04s)]
*  investigation into that matter, which is meant to inform the prosecutor's decisions about seeking [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1072.32s)]
*  indictments in that case, that grand jury report is about to be partially unsealed for the public. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1077.92s)]
*  And we're going to talk about the details of that in just a minute, because they're important. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1085.28s)]
*  But the bottom line is a big picture story for our democracy. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1088.48s)]
*  I mean, Trump may not find himself being charged in Georgia, just as he may not find himself being [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1095.04s)]
*  charged in New York State, where a grand jury is investigating him as well. He may not find himself [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  being charged in federal court in Washington, where multiple grand juries are investigating [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1104.96s)]
*  him now too. It's possible he won't face charges in any of these places, right? But if he is, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1108.8s)]
*  that process of us adjusting to that as a democracy is about to start now, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1115.28s)]
*  because the first grand jury we are going to hear from substantively is the one in Georgia, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1120.72s)]
*  and we are going to hear from them this week. And if you thought it was a bad look for our [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1125.04s)]
*  American version of one of these guys to be attacking the press for challenging him, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1129.68s)]
*  to be attacking the FBI and the Justice Department for investigating him, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1134.32s)]
*  what's around the corner for us as a democracy if he is indicted? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1137.52s)]
*  What's around the corner for us if he is indicted is an attack on the specific system that now [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1146.16s)]
*  poses the threat to him, the specific system that holds the power to indict him, to potentially [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1151.92s)]
*  arrest him, to put him in court, to put him on trial. It is one thing to invade against the people [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1159.04s)]
*  investigating you. What do you do when the court compels you to do something? Do you attack that [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1165.8400000000001s)]
*  system with the same vehemence and with the same willingness to burn down one of the pillars of [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1173.28s)]
*  our democracy? I mean, all around the world, we know what it looks like when far-right leaders [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1178.8s)]
*  try to disassemble those kinds of systems in order to assert and protect and maintain [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1185.6s)]
*  total power for themselves. We have never had to contend with that here. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1190.1599999999999s)]
*  We have a lot to learn quickly about how we're going to shore those things up so they stay [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1196.1599999999999s)]
*  standing about what is very likely coming. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YI-Uu-PtPM&t=1200.4s)]
