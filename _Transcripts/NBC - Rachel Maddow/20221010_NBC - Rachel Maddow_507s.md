# Russian Escalation In Ukraine Raises Question Of Corresponding Increase In U.S. Support
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU)
*  Today, Russia launched the largest airstrikes since the start of the war, saying they were [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=0.0s)]
*  retaliating for the attack this weekend on their newly built bridge to Crimea. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=5.4s)]
*  Crimea, of course, another part of Ukraine that Russia took over several years ago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=10.6s)]
*  The attacks by Russia today were not carried out by Russian troops making ground advances. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=15.5s)]
*  The Ukrainian military has been pushing Russian forces back and retaking the parts of Ukraine [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=20.82s)]
*  that Russia had invaded with ground troops. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=25.84s)]
*  Now, what happened today all over Ukraine, including in the capital city, including in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=28.0s)]
*  western Ukraine, far from the front lines, what happened today were these long-range [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=32.92s)]
*  Russian airstrikes on population centers, on cities, including the capital city, on [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=37.32s)]
*  civilian infrastructure. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=43.76s)]
*  And that poses a big question for us, for the United States. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=47.04s)]
*  As of now, one of the items on Ukraine's wish list that we have not given them are long-range [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=51.6s)]
*  missile systems so they could answer Russian long-range airstrikes in kind. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  Joining us now is John Kirby, retired Rear Admiral in the United States Navy, former [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=64.92s)]
*  Pentagon Press Secretary, now the spokesman for President Biden's National Security Council. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=68.44s)]
*  Admiral Kirby, it's a real pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=72.12s)]
*  Thank you for making the time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=74.36s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=75.36s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=76.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=77.36s)]
*  Let me just ask, first of all, if I got any of that the wrong way around or if there's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=78.36s)]
*  anything important that I'm leaving out, just in summing that up briefly there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=82.84s)]
*  No, no, I thought that was a terrific way to introduce our conversation tonight, Rachel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=87.88s)]
*  The conversation today with President Zelensky was useful, certainly helpful for President [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=93.52s)]
*  Biden. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=99.32s)]
*  And it was really important for President Biden to convey to President Zelensky that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=100.32s)]
*  we are going to continue our support, as the president has said, for as long as it takes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=104.44s)]
*  And that includes, as we, as you sort of did in your introduction, it includes continued [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=108.72s)]
*  air defense support. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=113.12s)]
*  We have provided 1,400 stingers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=114.36s)]
*  These are short-range shoulder-fired air defense missiles. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  We have helped get through other countries some longer-range air defense systems like [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  the S-300, which is something that the Ukrainians are comfortable using, gotten that into the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=125.68s)]
*  country. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=130.6s)]
*  And just recently, we've agreed to procure eight what we call NASAMs, which is a National [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=131.6s)]
*  Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, which will also greatly improve their ability for [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=137.78s)]
*  air defense purposes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=143.04s)]
*  So we're going to stay committed to this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=144.04s)]
*  We're going to talk to them every day, just like we did today, and make sure that we're [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=146.28s)]
*  meeting their needs as best we can. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=149.44s)]
*  And what about offensive weapons? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=151.92s)]
*  I mean, being able to disrupt, intercept, shoot down Russian incoming is one thing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=153.64s)]
*  But we know the Ukrainians want advanced rocket systems, advanced missile systems, and things [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  with perhaps a longer range than we've been willing to give them before. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=165.76s)]
*  I know that you're not going to break news here in terms of what the United States is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=169.16s)]
*  willing to give Ukraine that we haven't previously given them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=172.2s)]
*  But what can you explain to us about the thought process and the kind of parameters in which [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=175.44s)]
*  the U.S. government feels like it has to be able to operate to both help but not go too [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=179.76s)]
*  far to potentially provoke a Russia-NATO conflict? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=184.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, these are iterative conversations, honestly, that we're having with them almost [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=187.4s)]
*  every day. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=194.2s)]
*  And you know, if you remember way back in February, now almost eight months ago when [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=195.2s)]
*  this war started, the real demand signal was for Javelin anti-tank missiles because it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=198.2s)]
*  was those big convoys moving on Kiev, and they needed to get those armored vehicles [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=202.96s)]
*  stopped. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  Then it was about stingers, right, in more short-range air defense. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=209.32s)]
*  As Putin decided in the spring that he was going to focus on the Donbass, which is a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=213.8s)]
*  lot like Kansas, it's open farmland, small villages and towns, we knew and the Ukrainians [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  knew that they were going to need artillery, what we call long-range fires, the ability [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  to hit targets far away on the ground, from the ground. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=227.16s)]
*  And so we provided dozens and dozens of howitzers, artillery pieces, as well as literally tens [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=230.32s)]
*  of thousands of pieces of ammunition for them, as well as these highmars that I know you've [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=236.16s)]
*  been talking about, the advanced rocket systems that are highly mobile, highmars, that's what [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=240.24s)]
*  that means. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=246.56s)]
*  They've got, you know, almost 20 of those on the ground. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=247.56s)]
*  So we're going to keep evolving the needs as the war changes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=250.84s)]
*  And you are starting to see, as President Zelensky said today, clearly a stronger need [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=254.84s)]
*  right now for air defense. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=260.36s)]
*  And so we're going to have that conversation with them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=261.76s)]
*  We're going to keep we're going to keep changing the capabilities that we provide to make sure [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=263.48s)]
*  we're meeting their needs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  Look, they are in the fight of their lives, literally. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  And some of that video footage that you showed, I think, demonstrates the degree to which [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=272.2s)]
*  Mr. Putin was going after civilian infrastructure and civilian targets with no regard for innocent [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=276.32s)]
*  civilian life. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=282.74s)]
*  We know that the fight is serious there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=283.74s)]
*  And we're going to keep making sure that, again, the capabilities we give them are helping [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=286.66s)]
*  them in that fight, helping them defend their territory. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=290.14s)]
*  There's been a bunch of reporting recently. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=293.3s)]
*  I feel like our capacity as Kremlin ologists have sort of waxed and waned over the course [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=295.5s)]
*  of my lifetime in terms of how much we understand about what's really happening in St. Peter's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=300.66s)]
*  Square over there. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=304.90000000000003s)]
*  But I feel like there's been a lot of reporting recently that war hawks, real hardliners within [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=305.90000000000003s)]
*  the Russian power structure, have been exerting a lot of pressure on Putin to escalate attacks [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=313.26s)]
*  on Ukraine. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=318.90000000000003s)]
*  That may be some of what he is responding to. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  You saw an interesting reflection of that, I thought, today, when the Ukrainians said [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=321.62s)]
*  that we don't believe today's missile strikes by Russia were in response to the bridge attack [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=327.04s)]
*  this weekend. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=332.54s)]
*  We think that these were planned even before the bridge was hit, which would imply that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=333.54s)]
*  Putin was responding to other kinds of pressures rather than just retaliating for that one [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=337.82s)]
*  attack. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=343.54s)]
*  How much do you credit those reports? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=344.54s)]
*  How important is it for us to understand what's motivating Putin in any one day? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=345.74s)]
*  It's always important to understand the decision-making process over there because of the toll it's [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=353.38s)]
*  literally taking on the people of Ukraine. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=358.02000000000004s)]
*  And I wish I could tell you, Rachel, that we have perfect visibility into how Mr. Putin [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=360.54s)]
*  thinks or what his next move is going to be. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=364.38s)]
*  We just don't. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  What we can do is judge by his actions in the past and see, you know, kind of how things [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=368.3s)]
*  are unfolding on the battlefield, which again informs the capabilities that we provide the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=373.22s)]
*  Ukrainians. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=376.62s)]
*  I think there's a case to be made here that these attacks today were probably planned [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=377.62s)]
*  quite a while ago. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=383.66s)]
*  I mean, you think about the size and scale and scope of these attacks, more than 80 missiles [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=384.98s)]
*  and or drones used in today's attacks. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=389.54s)]
*  The Russians can't throw something like that together in just a couple of days. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=392.82000000000005s)]
*  So I think there's some credibility to the idea that this itself wasn't just a retaliation [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=396.18s)]
*  to the explosion on the Crimea bridge. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=402.42s)]
*  Now, maybe they accelerated it a little bit because I don't know. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=403.78000000000003s)]
*  But this is very much what we've seen today is very much in keeping with the attacks on [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=407.62s)]
*  civilian infrastructure that we have been seeing over the last month, the six weeks. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  So we see it very much as a continuation of the brutality and again, the wanton disregard [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=415.88s)]
*  by Mr. Putin for innocent civilian life inside Ukraine. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=420.86s)]
*  It's very much in keeping with that with that track. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=424.0s)]
*  Now, where it goes from here again, we don't know. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=426.46000000000004s)]
*  Everybody wants to see this war escalate beyond the level of death and destruction that it's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=429.06s)]
*  already visited on the Ukrainian people. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=433.29999999999995s)]
*  We have been and I think you and I have talked about this in the past. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=436.06s)]
*  I mean, from the very beginning, we've been mindful of escalation management here as we've [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=438.74s)]
*  gone through the provision of supplies and security assistance to Ukraine, making sure [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=443.41999999999996s)]
*  that we are thinking through escalation management issues as we do that, because again, having [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=448.7s)]
*  this war escalate beyond where it is, having it see the use of weapons of mass destruction [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoo-3V2jeiU&t=454.38s)]
