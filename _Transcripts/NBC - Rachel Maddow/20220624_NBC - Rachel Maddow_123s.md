# Threat Of Anti-Abortion Terrorism Amplified As Bans Reduce Number Of Providers
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg)
*  In the short run, we do now have abortion bans in effect in multiple states as of right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=0.0s)]
*  now because of today's ruling already. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=5.28s)]
*  We're going to be talking about that in more detail over the course of the hour. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=6.96s)]
*  One of the short-run consequences of that is not just that the number of states, but [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=11.44s)]
*  the actual number of buildings, the actual number of facilities in which an abortion [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=16.72s)]
*  legally can be provided in America has just shrunk radically. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=20.94s)]
*  The number of legal abortion providers in America has today radically contracted. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=25.14s)]
*  And that means the existing extant, still-working abortion providers in this country now stand [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=30.34s)]
*  out more to the people who have been targeting them for decades. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=36.94s)]
*  It means that the people from the terroristic side of the anti-abortion movement will now [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  have a smaller number of higher-profile targets to target. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  We should take that seriously at a time when violence against abortion providers is already [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=50.14s)]
*  spiking. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=54.66s)]
*  The providers who are now left in the states where it is not banned yet, those providers [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=55.66s)]
*  are facing a lot of changes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=62.459999999999994s)]
*  They're going to have to operate now with a higher volume of patients, people coming [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=65.58s)]
*  from further away, people therefore coming in later in their pregnancies, which means [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=69.08s)]
*  potentially more complicated procedures because of that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=73.06s)]
*  But they also are going to have to cope, on top of all that, they're going to have to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=75.94s)]
*  cope with a higher threat environment than they are used to. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=79.69999999999999s)]
*  Because the anti-abortion movement, feeling its oats, really does have an armed terrorist [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=84.32s)]
*  wing that shoots people. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=89.72s)]
*  And that's been true for decades. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=91.6s)]
*  It has never been more crucial to protect abortion providers. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WVKFRF6Adg&t=93.88s)]
