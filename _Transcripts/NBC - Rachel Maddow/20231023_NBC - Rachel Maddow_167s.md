# Democrats inexplicably allow indicted Senator Bob Menendez to continue serving
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M)
*  Do you notice anything strange in this image? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=0.0s)]
*  This is not the House, which the Republicans have lost control of themselves, and we therefore [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=4.88s)]
*  don't have a working House of Representatives. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=9.32s)]
*  This is the Senate, where Democrats are in charge. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=11.36s)]
*  What do you notice about this picture? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=14.32s)]
*  Look who's on the Foreign Relations Committee in the United States Senate. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  Still, as of today, they took him out of his position as chairman of the Foreign Relations [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=21.92s)]
*  Committee. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=27.8s)]
*  He is still there. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=28.8s)]
*  While today he was arraigned on a federal felony indictment for allegedly conspiring [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=30.8s)]
*  to work as a foreign agent, as an agent of the Egyptian government. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=35.76s)]
*  He pled not guilty today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=40.68s)]
*  He released a statement after his plea insisting on his innocence. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=41.96s)]
*  But this is the same U.S. Senator who was already recently indicted on federal felony [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=45.16s)]
*  charges of bribery, of conspiracy to commit extortion. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Now he's charged as an alleged foreign agent. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=53.24s)]
*  And while he is under indictment on those charges, he is continuing to serve on the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=57.6s)]
*  Senate Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=62.4s)]
*  Like this is normal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=64.92s)]
*  More than 30 Democratic senators have called on New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez to resign, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=68.4s)]
*  even though he too is a Democrat. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=73.48s)]
*  No Republicans have called on him to resign because presumably that's too awkward for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=76.44s)]
*  them with their own party's leader indicted on 91 felony charges. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=80.04s)]
*  But honestly, who cares about whether other people are doing the right thing or the wrong [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=84.72s)]
*  thing? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=88.96s)]
*  You still have to do the right thing or answer for it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=89.96s)]
*  Democrats control the United States Senate. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=93.16s)]
*  I understand they do not have enough votes to expel Bob Menendez from the Senate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=96.24s)]
*  You need a two thirds vote to expel a senator. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=101.24s)]
*  It almost never happens. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  It hasn't happened since they expelled Confederates during the Civil War. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=105.4s)]
*  I get that about the issue of expulsion, just the practicalities of it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=109.0s)]
*  But leaving him on the U.S. Senate's Foreign Relations Committee right now, while he is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=113.4s)]
*  on trial as an alleged foreign agent in this world with what we've got going on right now, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=118.0s)]
*  seriously, I honestly just do not know why Democrats don't want to do this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=124.6s)]
*  It would not be hard if they wanted to do it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=128.84s)]
*  If they wanted to kick him off the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, all they'd have [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=132.04s)]
*  to do is kick him off and put somebody else on in his place. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=135.16s)]
*  That's it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=139.56s)]
*  I have absolutely no idea why they aren't doing it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=141.36s)]
*  But so far they're not. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6DtutKSx0M&t=144.8s)]
