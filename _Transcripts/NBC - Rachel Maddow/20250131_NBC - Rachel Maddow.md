Video Description: In an effort to not only rewrite the history of his January 6 insurrection but to exact revenge on the agents and lawyers who worked to hold him and his rioting supporters accountable, Donald Trump appears to be in the midst of a massive purge of the FBI and the DOJ, turning them into agencies that cater to his interests and concerns instead of the law. Rachel Maddow explains.

# Trump moves toward ending independent law enforcement as a core American value with mass purge
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ)
*  What they're trying to do tonight is not trying to stop an active investigation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight, they're seeking revenge for law enforcement personnel who participated in a previous investigation that is now over. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=5.7s)]
*  And the reason that is worse is because the point of what they are doing tonight is to permanently, irrevocably change law enforcement in the United States of America. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=14.9s)]
*  To make it so FBI agents and prosecutors just won't in the future pursue criminal investigations and criminal cases if the suspected criminals in those cases are associated with the president and this movement that supports him. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=26.0s)]
*  They are trying to not get rid of an investigation. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=41.6s)]
*  They're trying to get rid of American law enforcement as we know it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=44.8s)]
*  They are trying to get rid of the very idea of an independent justice is blind system that makes America who we are. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=48.2s)]
*  This is not the Saturday Massacre. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  This is considerably worse and it is hard to see how what happens tonight can be corrected can be undone the way the Saturday Massacre was undone within 12 days. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=61.5s)]
*  This is a really serious thing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=74.4s)]
*  Now before tonight, they had already fired prosecutors who had worked on the special counsel's investigation that brought charges against President Trump. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=76.5s)]
*  The charges for the alleged hoarding and mishandling of classified documents charges for illegally trying to overthrow the results of the 2020 presidential election. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  They already fired prosecutors involved with those investigations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=92.6s)]
*  What they are doing tonight is apparently attempting a mass purge of prosecutors who worked on all the other January 6 cases. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=98.4s)]
*  The ones just involving rioters who attacked the Capitol building on Trump's behalf tonight. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  Approximately 30 prosecutors who worked on January 6th rioter prosecutions have all been fired. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=112.2s)]
*  Beyond that beyond that they appear to be in the midst of a mass purge at the FBI. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=119.10000000000001s)]
*  At least a half dozen senior leaders of the FBI have already been told to resign or be fired on Monday. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=126.7s)]
*  Beyond that senior leadership though, they're also trying to remove just normal FBI line agents potentially hundreds or even thousands of them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=134.2s)]
*  Now as I mentioned at the top of the hour, this is still an emerging story details may yet evolve as the story develops and we learn more. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=147.2s)]
*  My best understanding of what has happened thus far is this and if I if I stand corrected by the end of this hour, I will not be surprised. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=154.2s)]
*  But this is what I understand it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  What I understand has happened just thus far in an instruction that appears to have originated at the White House. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  Trump's handpicked acting officials at the Justice Department directed FBI headquarters to hand over internal files from the Jack Smith cases. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=173.1s)]
*  From the Trump classified documents case from the Trump overthrow of the election case. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=183.7s)]
*  They were told the FBI FBI headquarters was told to hand over those files. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=187.6s)]
*  So a list could be made of all FBI line agents and FBI supervisors who were involved in those cases in any way. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=192.2s)]
*  So personnel action could be taken against those FBI personnel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=200.0s)]
*  So they could be punished removed reassigned or fired. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=205.89999999999998s)]
*  The Washington Post reports tonight that FBI supervisors advised agents that any agents who worked on either of those two cases the Jack Smith cases. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=211.1s)]
*  FBI supervisors reportedly advised agents that they should be prepared for the Trump administration to release to the public. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=220.0s)]
*  The names of the FBI agents who worked on those cases before they were then they would then be fired on Monday. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=227.2s)]
*  So rather than just firing them, they were basically going to tell, you know, Trump supporters, including those who were just let out of prison by Donald Trump, tell them, hey, here's the names of FBI agents who are part of all the January 6 investigations. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=234.3s)]
*  The ones that targeted Trump. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  Don't worry, though, they're no longer agents. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=252.8s)]
*  We're firing them today. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=255.4s)]
*  So go ahead and have Adam. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=256.5s)]
*  Now tonight, MSNBC's Ryan Reilly has obtained a memo sent by the acting director of the FBI to all FBI personnel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=258.4s)]
*  And it would seem to indicate that even beyond those things that I have just described, beyond the prosecutors who did the two Trump cases, beyond FBI personnel at the senior levels of the FBI, beyond FBI personnel involved in the two Trump cases. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  What Ryan Reilly's obtained tonight. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=281.3s)]
*  This this letter from the acting FBI director to all FBI personnel would seem to indicate that they are planning a massive purge beyond that some kind of purge against not just the agents who participated in some way in the two Jack Smith cases where Trump was charged. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=284.5s)]
*  But beyond that, they appear to be targeting all the FBI agents who were involved in any of the cases brought against January 6 rioters. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=301.3s)]
*  And to put this in perspective, the January 6 riot cases make up the largest single investigation ever in the history of the Bureau. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=310.3s)]
*  The January 6 cases are the largest criminal caseload ever assembled by the Department of Justice. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=318.3s)]
*  If they are going to try to purge every FBI agent who took any part in any one of these well over 1000 cases. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=323.0s)]
*  That's that's kind of the whole FBI. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=335.0s)]
*  I mean, not every single member of the FBI, but certainly most of the FBI. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=340.0s)]
*  Here's the memo obtained tonight by MSNBC's Ryan Reilly quote colleagues. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=346.0s)]
*  We understand there's a lot of media reporting and rumors surrounding potential changes at the FBI. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=350.2s)]
*  This includes reporting and rumors about actions that very seriously impact our workforce. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=356.2s)]
*  Consistent with our commitment to share information with you as we receive it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=361.2s)]
*  Acting Deputy Director Cassane and I want to provide you with an update late this afternoon. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=365.2s)]
*  I received a memo from the acting Deputy Attorney General notifying me that eight senior FBI executives are to be terminated by specific dates. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=370.2s)]
*  Unless these employees have retired beforehand. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=377.4s)]
*  So eight of them will be out unless they quit quote. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=380.4s)]
*  I have been personally in touch with each of these impacted employees. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=384.4s)]
*  The memo also directs me to provide by noon on Tuesday. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=388.4s)]
*  The following quote all current and former FBI personnel assigned at any time to investigations and or prosecutions relating to events that occurred at or near the US Capitol on January 6 2021. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=392.4s)]
*  And also secondly United States versus Hanaya, which is I believe a case about Hamas and the October 7th attack. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=402.6s)]
*  They want a list of all current and former FBI personnel assigned at any time to investigations or prosecutions related to January 6th or that one Hamas case. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=412.6s)]
*  Quote these lists should include relevant supervisory personnel and FBI regional offices and field divisions as well as FBI headquarters for each employee included in the list provide the current title office to which the person is assigned role in the investigation or prosecution and date of last activity relating to the investigation or prosecution. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=422.8s)]
*  Upon tightly receipt of the requested information. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=438.8s)]
*  The Office of the Deputy Attorney General will commence a review process to determine whether additional personnel actions are necessary. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=442.0s)]
*  The acting director of the FBI then tells personnel the FBI quote we understand that this request encompasses thousands of FBI employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=451.0s)]
*  I am one of those employees as is acting Deputy Director Kassein. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=463.0s)]
*  As we have said since the moment we agreed to take on these roles, meaning the acting director and acting acting Deputy Director of the FBI. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=467.2s)]
*  We are going to follow the law follow FBI policy and do what is in the best interest of the workforce and the American people always we will be back in touch with more information as soon as we can. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=474.2s)]
*  In the meantime, stay safe and take care of each other. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=484.2s)]
*  Brian J Driscoll Jr acting director. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=488.2s)]
*  Again, this letter tonight to all FBI personalities from Brian Driscoll who is the somewhat accidental acting director of the FBI as former Trump defense lawyer and mail Bova at the Justice Department possibly on orders from the White House has demanded a list of every single FBI agent in the entire country who worked on any January 6 case in any capacity at all. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=490.4s)]
*  And even though that includes the FBI agents, the FBI agents are still in the process of getting the FBI to the FBI. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=509.4s)]
*  And even though that includes the new acting director and the new acting deputy director who Trump himself just ham handedly accidentally appointed. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=517.6s)]
*  They say the reason they want that list is because they're going to review it for potential personnel action against all those agents. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=526.6s)]
*  Again, that is thousands of FBI FBI agents all across the country. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=534.6s)]
*  And again, this is a developing story. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=539.8s)]
*  This is as clear as I can be with you right now on the details of what has happened and what they seem to be trying to do. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=543.0s)]
*  But also be clear on what this what this means. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=548.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=552.8s)]
*  This is not an an if situation. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=553.8s)]
*  We are seeing it already with the firings they have already effectuated with the threats they have already made. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=556.4s)]
*  If law enforcement officials and agents have their careers threatened, which they have now all had their careers threatened, and indeed if they are fired and they indeed are already starting to be fired. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=561.8s)]
*  If they have their careers threatened and are fired because they took part in lawfully predicated criminal investigations, where grand juries handed down indictments, where judges signed search warrants, where juries returned convictions. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=572.8s)]
*  If they nevertheless are fired for taking part in those lawful, proper criminal law enforcement actions because the president in power now doesn't like those cases. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=584.8s)]
*  That is not Nixon. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=596.8s)]
*  That is not a president trying to get out of an investigation he's scared of for himself. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=599.8s)]
*  That is that is the end of the story. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=604.8s)]
*  That is not a president trying to get out of an investigation he's scared of for himself. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=607.8s)]
*  That is that is the end of independent law enforcement as a core value of who we are as a country. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=612.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=620.8s)]
*  That's an end to the idea that law enforcement pursues justice without regard to favors and preferences dictated by the people in power. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=623.8s)]
*  Here's how the New York Times put it puts it tonight quote if the administration follows through it would be a singular moment in the FBI's history and it would fly in the face of decades worth of civil service laws that are meant to protect the integrity and professionalism of federal law enforcement. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=634.8s)]
*  And those are those are very pretty words and nice concepts and that means they all blur together and seem just kind of like Americana. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=651.8s)]
*  Let's be more blunt about it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=658.8s)]
*  If you lose those things if you lose the independence and professionalism of federal law enforcement. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=659.8s)]
*  What that means is we are rewiring the FBI and federal prosecutors so they will now henceforth only do arrests and searches and investigations and prosecutions that please the president. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=666.8s)]
*  Regardless of who it is that's committing crimes. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=683.8s)]
*  These firings which are now underway are changing one of the fundamental things that makes us the kind of country that we are. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=686.8s)]
*  This is very bad. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=694.8s)]
*  Jamie Raskin Democratic congressman and professor of constitutional law told the Washington Post tonight this he said quote if allowed to proceed Trump's purge of our federal law enforcement workforce will expose America to authoritarianism and dictatorship. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1HWDhLOoQ&t=697.8s)]
