# 'Celebration Of Survival' Holds New Meaning For Jewish Ukrainian Refugees
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0)
*  Today is Purim. It's a joyous Jewish holiday about saving the Jewish people [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=0.0s)]
*  from extermination at the hands of an evil government official. And because of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=4.48s)]
*  that origin story, the holiday has taken on greater significance this year. I was [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=8.48s)]
*  lucky enough to be invited to a Purim celebration here in Budapest, which [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=12.96s)]
*  despite everything had lots of Ukrainian refugees in attendance. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=16.52s)]
*  This is a celebration of survival for Jewish people everywhere and for the man [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=21.64s)]
*  playing the guitar, survival means something different this year. He and his [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=29.32s)]
*  family arrived here in Budapest after escaping Kyiv just one week ago. On this [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=33.64s)]
*  holiday, Purim, Jews traditionally spin noisy rattles called groggers to drown [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=38.88s)]
*  out the name of an oppressor more than 2,500 years ago. This year Hungarian Jews [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=44.24s)]
*  spin them to drown out the sounds of war, deafening their Ukrainian neighbors. If [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  we hear about the war, we try to send a message with this noise that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=54.88s)]
*  this war should be stopped immediately and we wish all the people in Ukraine will be free and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=61.36s)]
*  released from this threat. The party is themed in blue and gold for Ukraine, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=69.36s)]
*  people wearing buttons that say, rattle for peace. Purim is an ancient festival [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=74.16s)]
*  amongst the Jews. It celebrates the victory of Mordecai and Esther over [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=80.08s)]
*  Hamam, the Persian official who was plotting to kill all the Jews of Persia. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=84.96s)]
*  Now it's celebrated here with noisemakers and gifts and food and drink, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=88.96s)]
*  all of which take on heightened significance with the Jews that have now [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  escaped Ukraine. Tell me about the Jews that you've been meeting who have been [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=96.16s)]
*  coming here from Ukraine. Well in the last two weeks we have been seeing a [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=101.52s)]
*  great influx of refugees that have been coming from Ukraine, Jews and non-Jews as well. We try [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=106.16s)]
*  to help everyone but obviously the Jewish people that come through right away make the connection [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=111.44s)]
*  with us. Just three days after the war broke out, Rabbi Wolf from Odessa, a colleague of mine, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=115.36s)]
*  a Chabad Rabbi in Odessa, he calls me up he says, Rabbi Kovash, I don't know what to do, please try [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=121.2s)]
*  to help us. I have 150 kids, a Jewish orphanage, that are not safe now. They don't have parents, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=126.56s)]
*  they don't even have passports. How do we take them to a safer place? So we help to arrange them [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=132.4s)]
*  to come through the border without passports. And on this night this Budapest synagogue welcomes [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=137.28s)]
*  more than 50 Ukrainian refugees, brightening their lives in a particularly dark time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=142.72s)]
*  Among the guests, the musician is a Jewish scholar named Pinkus, forced to flee Ukraine in a car on [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=149.28s)]
*  Saturday, the Shabbat, something his interpretation of Jewish law would normally prohibit, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=155.28s)]
*  unless your life is in danger. So we went out of the city, we went to another place, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=160.88s)]
*  but it wasn't so safe there also. We went to a place where people rest, 200 kilometers from Kiev, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=165.68s)]
*  there's a place for resting, like a Jewish base of resting. Also there were many strikes there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=174.48s)]
*  Two nights we slept there and it was also scary. His family's safety now cause for celebration, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=181.84s)]
*  safety that for Jewish people throughout history and now all people of Ukraine has never been [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=189.44s)]
*  guaranteed. They built up a beautiful community just like this one with a school, with synagogues, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=195.12s)]
*  with old age homes and orphanages. And now after 30 years they just have to leave in one day, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=200.4s)]
*  they just close the door and they don't know if they will return. This breaks my heart and I [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=204.88s)]
*  think it has to break all of our hearts and we have to all make sure that we tell all the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=208.16s)]
*  decision makers they should put down the guns and people should pray to God that some common [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=213.2s)]
*  sense should come to humanity to understand that you cannot achieve anything with war. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=219.04s)]
*  We should achieve everything with the love of your fellow. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdNXGfgTr0&t=222.72s)]
