# January 6 Committee Making Vital Record In Face Of Big Lie And GOP Disinformation
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE)
*  Joining us now is presidential historian, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=0.0s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize winning author Doris Kearns Goodwin. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=2.44s)]
*  Her latest book is titled Leadership in Turbulent Times. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Ms. Goodwin, Doris, it is really [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=8.16s)]
*  great that you were able to make time to be with us tonight. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=9.88s)]
*  Thank you for making the time on this big day. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=11.8s)]
*  I'm very glad to be with you, Rachel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask if I misconstrued the point that you were making today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=16.92s)]
*  I tried to play it without interruption, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=23.2s)]
*  without any internal edits so people could hear it the way that you presented it [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=24.92s)]
*  because it sort of knocked me off my chair a little bit. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=28.2s)]
*  Let me just ask if I interpreted that wrong or heard it wrong. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=30.52s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=34.48s)]
*  I mean, I think what you saw in the 1850s and what you're seeing right now [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=35.48s)]
*  are alternative realities, right? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=39.96s)]
*  On one side in the north is seeing it as you said. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=42.6s)]
*  What happened to Sumner as a terrible event, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=44.92s)]
*  the side in the south is seeing it as a glorious event. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=47.6s)]
*  What we're seeing right now is an election that presumably [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=50.28s)]
*  their claiming on one side was not won was stolen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  And the truth is on the other side that it was won by Biden. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=57.2s)]
*  You've got alternative realities now about what the insurrection was. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=60.68s)]
*  Was it an insurrection or was it simply a bunch of tourists running around? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=64.04s)]
*  But I think the most important thing to understand if we try to figure out [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=68.04s)]
*  where can we go from here, which is I think what you wanted to talk about, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=71.2s)]
*  is that when Lincoln gets in in 1861, he said the central idea of the struggle [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=74.68s)]
*  they were fighting, the Civil War had already started, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  was whether or not if a minority, and by that he meant a minority [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=83.56s)]
*  who lost an election, did not accept that they had lost an election [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=87.08s)]
*  and they decide that they are going to break from the union [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=91.48s)]
*  as they did to secede from the union, then democracy is an absurdity. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=94.48s)]
*  It can't work. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=98.48s)]
*  And what are we seeing right now? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=99.72s)]
*  But the minority that lost the election is claiming it wasn't lost. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  They are having state legislatures now with the possibility to overturn [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=106.08s)]
*  the will of the people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=109.88s)]
*  They're having partisan people counting the votes [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=111.28s)]
*  instead of the nonpartisan volunteers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=114.03999999999999s)]
*  I think if Lincoln were here now, he would say, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=116.48s)]
*  if that's true, then democracy is an absurdity. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=118.92s)]
*  So, what do we do? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=121.52s)]
*  We go for voting rights. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=122.52s)]
*  We have to protect it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=123.72s)]
*  It's the most important thing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=124.72s)]
*  As long as I've lived, it's the fight that I think is the most important fight [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=126.64s)]
*  in my life. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=129.92s)]
*  When I was involved as a young girl in the March on Washington, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=130.92s)]
*  when I sat and listened to Lyndon Johnson's joint session of Congress speech [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=134.44s)]
*  where he said voting is not a partisan issue, it's not a northern issue, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=138.36s)]
*  it's not a southern issue, it's just for to get the Voting Rights Act of 65. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=142.4s)]
*  It's not even a moral challenge because it's undeniably wrong [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  to deny your fellow Americans the right to vote. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=149.92s)]
*  That's what's happening right now, and that's the fight we have to fight. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  That's the only answer to understanding these divisions we have right now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=155.12s)]
*  Doris, I was struck today when you said that what you thought would happen [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  after January 6th is that there would be a realignment, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=163.68s)]
*  that there would be a recognition, such a widespread recognition, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=166.48s)]
*  about things having gone so wrong on one side of our politics, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  that there would be an ideological realignment of the parties. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=174.0s)]
*  If it wasn't the collapse of the Whig Party and the rise of the Republicans, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  there's some analogy of that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=182.32s)]
*  At least there would be some other sort of change along those lines. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  And obviously, we haven't seen that, but we have seen the right get weird [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=186.16s)]
*  in terms of its devotion to its failed presidential candidate [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=192.72s)]
*  who was not able to win a second term, the driving out of the party, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  people who have a message about integrity and the unity of the country [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=200.52s)]
*  and the fealty to the Constitution that would have a widespread appeal. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  There is a sort of schismatic thing happening inside the right [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=209.44s)]
*  that doesn't look like a party realignment, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=213.4s)]
*  but does look like a structural change of some kind. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  I wondered if you see it that way and if that is something that you see, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=218.56s)]
*  you expect to continue to evolve. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=222.96s)]
*  I think it's possible. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=225.28s)]
*  I mean, I think what happened in January 6th [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  was it was enough of an emotional reaction [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  that you heard McConnell say that this was an attack [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  that was provoked by the president. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=234.76s)]
*  You heard McCarthy say it was an undemocratic assault on the Constitution. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  And you heard Republicans who were breaking away at that point. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=241.28s)]
*  And somehow that image and that emotion was lost. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  And we have so many breaking news and that's what happens today. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=248.48s)]
*  Things are lost. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=251.28s)]
*  That's the hope of what January 6th and the commemoration today, I think, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=252.56s)]
*  and the select committee can do, if they can bring that story back [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=257.44s)]
*  so that there's a fundamental sense on the part of more people. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=261.35999999999996s)]
*  And I think they're out there, the people that know it was wrong, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=264.76s)]
*  they know what happened, if they can fill in the dots of that story. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=267.35999999999996s)]
*  And stories are what produce a reaction in people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=271.12s)]
*  Lincoln told so many stories and people used to say, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=274.32s)]
*  why do you tell so many stories? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=276.91999999999996s)]
*  He said, because stories have a beginning, a middle and an end. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=278.84s)]
*  They have more of an emotional appeal than facts and figures. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=282.0s)]
*  So if that committee can produce a story now and bring it back to the American people [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=285.56s)]
*  in even greater detail than what we knew on January 6th, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=290.08s)]
*  then you've got to hope that that will affect more people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=293.24s)]
*  And maybe that schism in the Republican Party will get bigger [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=295.68s)]
*  and we'll begin to see some new formation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=298.68s)]
*  I guess as an historian, just having lived through all this, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  you've just got to hope that there's some hope from what happened. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=303.08s)]
*  And we've seen that, we've seen it in the long run over and over again in American history. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=306.12s)]
*  I think that's a really, really important point. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=312.08s)]
*  I think a lot about the committee. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=313.76s)]
*  I think a lot of Americans, particularly people who are horrified [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=315.84s)]
*  by what happened on January 6th, they're looking at the committee [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=318.52s)]
*  and we keep connecting it to the Justice Department. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  And is there going to be accountability? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=323.68s)]
*  And is there going to be, you know, are people going to go to jail [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=325.0s)]
*  and are people going to get in trouble and are people going to repent? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=327.28s)]
*  But as you point out, the other part of it is not about the perpetrators [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  and the way they are treated. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=333.68s)]
*  It is about correctly securing and telling the story of that day [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=334.92s)]
*  in a way that makes it clear to the American people [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=340.92s)]
*  so that we understand ourselves in a true, well-informed way [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=344.0s)]
*  and can make good decisions about these kinds of problems [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=347.92s)]
*  and these kinds of crisis moving forward. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=351.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, think about the isolationism that we were facing in 1939 and 1940. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=353.96s)]
*  And before Pearl Harbor, FDR was able to tell a story to the American people [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=359.48s)]
*  about why it was important to support England, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=363.92s)]
*  who was standing alone against the Nazis in Western Europe. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=366.48s)]
*  And he talks about Len Lease and he makes it in a metaphor [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=369.64000000000004s)]
*  that you're going toâneighbors' houses on fire, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=373.04s)]
*  you're going to lend them a hose to save their house, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=375.48s)]
*  which will then save yours. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=377.88s)]
*  So somehow, that's what a story does. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=379.8s)]
*  I mean, our best leaders understood how to tell stories. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=382.24s)]
*  And I think if this committee can tell in a compelling way, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=385.08000000000004s)]
*  they have the evidence, they have to just put it together [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=388.12s)]
*  so that fair-minded people, all you need is 5 or 10 percent [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=390.44s)]
*  to change where they are now. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=394.44s)]
*  And maybe that will make the other people in the party, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=395.68s)]
*  Republicans, say, this is where the country's going. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  There's already a majority that believes that this was an insurrection. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=400.56s)]
*  There's a majority that believes the election was won. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=403.88s)]
*  But it's got to affect the party structure. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=406.44s)]
*  And that's what I think, that's where the hope is, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=409.2s)]
*  that people will be influenced by something that is fair and true. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=411.24s)]

*  You can also repeat the truth over and over again in a compelling way. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  And then maybe that will battle the lie that's out there. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9HELklVDE&t=422.12s)]
