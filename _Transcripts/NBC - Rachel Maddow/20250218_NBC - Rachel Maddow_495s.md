# Trump oddly squeamish under questioning about contact with Putin
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4)
*  Part of the reason I think it's safe to say this is at least a wild card is because [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=0.0s)]
*  of how Trump has been talking about it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=5.44s)]
*  It's because it's been something that Trump has himself been so cagey and so palpably [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=7.44s)]
*  scared about talking about for so long that I think he knows the public really doesn't [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=12.68s)]
*  want to see this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=17.88s)]
*  And I'll show you what I mean. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=20.26s)]
*  I'll show you what I mean here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=21.44s)]
*  It started with a simple yes or no question. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=22.96s)]
*  Question. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=26.12s)]
*  Have you spoken to Vladimir Putin since your election? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=27.28s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=31.12s)]
*  Answer. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=32.68s)]
*  I can't tell you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  I can't tell you. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  It's just inappropriate. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  Trump interview after the election with Time magazine. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=39.04s)]
*  It's inappropriate? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=41.24s)]
*  It's not appropriate for us to ask you if you've spoken to Putin or it's not appropriate [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=42.24s)]
*  for you to say? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=47.92s)]
*  That was December, about a month after the election. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=50.24s)]
*  By that point, it was widely reported that Trump had taken calls from world leaders across [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=53.36s)]
*  the whole planet like France and Israel and India, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UK, Ukraine, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=57.76s)]
*  South Korea. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=62.0s)]
*  Trump himself made a big deal of announcing that he, announcing before he was sworn in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=63.0s)]
*  that he had spoken to President Xi Jinping of China. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=67.0s)]
*  He said, quote, the call was a very good one. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=69.6s)]
*  So he's bragging about and letting it be known about and sort of effusing about all [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=72.2s)]
*  of his calls with all of these foreign leaders all over the world, including very controversial [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=77.68s)]
*  ones like the president of communist China. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=81.64s)]
*  But when you ask him if he talked to Putin, he says that's inappropriate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=85.76s)]
*  He doesn't want to talk about it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=88.4s)]
*  But, you know, I said that was December. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=91.08s)]
*  Maybe that was just something weird about being in the transition. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=94.48s)]
*  Maybe once he took office, once he was officially president, he would find it more appropriate [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=96.68s)]
*  to issue some clarity on this issue. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=101.0s)]
*  Let's ask him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=104.12s)]
*  I'm going to talk to him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=105.12s)]
*  Who? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=108.44s)]
*  That was inauguration day, January 20th. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=110.24s)]
*  Are you going to be talking to Vladimir Putin? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=112.72s)]
*  Who? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=114.88s)]
*  Vladimir, who? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=115.88s)]
*  Talking to what? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=116.88s)]
*  Me? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=118.36s)]
*  Hmm? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=119.36s)]
*  Are you going to be talking to Vladimir Putin? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  Who? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=123.8s)]
*  Do you plan to meet President Putin, sir? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=124.8s)]
*  I'll be meeting with President Putin. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=127.56s)]
*  When? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=129.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=130.56s)]
*  I can't. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=131.56s)]
*  It's being said. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=132.56s)]
*  When do you plan to speak to President Putin? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=133.56s)]
*  Could be very soon. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=134.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=135.56s)]
*  I can't. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=137.56s)]
*  It's being set up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=138.68s)]
*  Oh, that Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=140.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=141.68s)]
*  I can't. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=142.68s)]
*  It's being set up. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=143.68s)]
*  I'll be meeting with him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=144.68s)]
*  I can't say. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=145.68s)]
*  It's being set up soon. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=146.68s)]
*  Again, that was inauguration day. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=147.68s)]
*  Again, not the most forthcoming answer, but a little closer to getting an answer. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=150.28s)]
*  Maybe? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=155.52s)]
*  Have you spoken to him? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=156.52s)]
*  I don't want to say. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=159.08s)]
*  That was only three days after the inauguration, three days later. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=161.72s)]
*  Have you spoken to him? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=165.28s)]
*  I don't want to say. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=166.28s)]
*  Somebody getting so shy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=168.28s)]
*  Have you spoken to Vladimir Putin? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=170.76s)]
*  I don't want to say. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=172.12s)]
*  Why don't you want to say? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=173.12s)]
*  Okay, how about another chance to clear it up? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=175.16s)]
*  Can I say on your call with Vladimir Putin? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=178.16s)]
*  Well, we'll be speaking. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=185.08s)]
*  We are having discussions, yes. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=186.88s)]
*  Ongoing? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=189.08s)]
*  Already scheduled and ongoing? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=190.08s)]
*  Already talking, yes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=192.28s)]
*  So you've already spoken of Vladimir Putin? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=194.16s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=195.68s)]
*  We will be speaking. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=199.08s)]
*  We are already having discussions. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=200.68s)]
*  So you've already spoken to Putin. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=202.36s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=203.68s)]
*  I don't want to say? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=206.16s)]
*  There's nothing that this man doesn't want to say. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=207.88s)]
*  This man wants to say everything that has ever crossed his mind. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  He's the freest man in the world. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  But that I don't want to say. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=216.24s)]
*  I can't say. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=217.24s)]
*  It's not appropriate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=218.24s)]
*  That last clip takes us to the end of January by the first week of this month, February. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=220.96s)]
*  Headline in the New York Post. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=225.88s)]
*  Exclusive! [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  Trump reveals he's spoken with Putin by phone. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=229.44s)]
*  Ah, no more Vladimir who? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=232.12s)]
*  No more I don't want to say? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=234.52s)]
*  No more how dare you ask me such an inappropriate question? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=235.84s)]
*  Trump reveals he has spoken with Putin by phone. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  How many times have they spoken by phone, you might be asking? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=241.24s)]
*  Quote, when asked how many times the two leaders have spoken, Trump said, quote, I'd better [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  not say. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Sir, can you tell us about your conversation with Vladimir Putin? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  He's been talking to Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=256.92s)]
*  Are you trying to set up a meeting with him? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=257.92s)]
*  Well, I can't tell you what I'm talking about. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=260.92s)]
*  You can't? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=266.16s)]
*  Aren't you the boss? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=267.16s)]
*  We do not play a lot of video on the show of President Trump talking. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=272.12s)]
*  You might have noticed that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=276.36s)]
*  We have this sort of mantra that we try to follow, which is watch what they do, not [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=278.76s)]
*  what they say. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=281.52s)]
*  So we don't play a lot of tape of him talking. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=282.52s)]
*  But every once in a while, I think it is worth the exception just to see that this is something [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=284.08s)]
*  that he talks about the way he talks about nothing else. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  This is something that he's palpably scared to say, or he feels constrained, like he's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=292.48s)]
*  not allowed to say. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=297.84s)]
*  Why is he so scared of this one thing? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=299.84s)]
*  Have you talked to President Putin? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=302.28s)]
*  No, I have not. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=307.48s)]
*  You mean no, well, I don't want to say that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  But I haven't spoken to him recently. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=312.8s)]
*  So you've spoken to President Putin since you've been elected? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=314.6s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't want to say anything about that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=317.08000000000004s)]
*  Have you spoken to him? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't want to say. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  So you've already spoken to Vladimir Putin since? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  Are you trying to set up a meeting with him? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, I can't tell you what I'm talking about. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  Can you tell us about your conversation with Vladimir Putin? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  See, he really doesn't want to say. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  He really, really, really doesn't want to say. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=335.36s)]
*  He can't say. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=337.2s)]
*  Who tells you what you can and can't say? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=338.2s)]
*  Today, of course, we had the U.S. Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=341.2s)]
*  whatever that real estate guy's job is, we had this high-level delegation from the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=348.2s)]
*  United States meet in Saudi Arabia with the Russian government ahead of what is promised [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=353.8s)]
*  to be a Trump meeting with Vladimir Putin very soon. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=361.64s)]
*  No Western leader has met with Vladimir Putin since he invaded Ukraine three years ago. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=366.8s)]
*  But the United States is not only apparently taking Russia's side now, changing sides [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=371.56s)]
*  in that war now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=376.48s)]
*  We're essentially changing sides in the world. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=378.36s)]
*  The United States is now apparently against Europe and our allies over the last 80 years [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=381.88s)]
*  and for Russia. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=388.72s)]
*  While the president repeatedly and eerily and in a very out-of-character way tells the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=391.56s)]
*  American people he is not allowed to discuss that relationship or his communications with [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=397.92s)]
*  that leader. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=402.44s)]
*  The political reality of this administration is going to be shaped by whether or not the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=407.58s)]
*  people who oppose him oppose him strongly enough and effectively enough. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=411.36s)]
*  The political reality of this administration and this presidency will be determined by [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=416.14s)]
*  also by whether the people who voted for him are horrified enough by what they have wrought [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=421.58s)]
*  that they regret it and are willing to act differently and to speak out about their regret. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=427.82s)]
*  The reality of this presidency and this administration will be determined in some part by whether [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=434.46s)]
*  or not Republican officials realize that their own survival as politicians depends not on [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=440.78s)]
*  sucking up to Trump, but by helping their constituents survive him. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=445.88s)]
*  Strong evidence supporting all of those strikes against Trump so far, frankly. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=452.32s)]
*  But this is one other thing to watch. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=459.2s)]
*  If we really are now abandoning the free world and lining up instead with the world's dictatorships [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=461.2s)]
*  and Trump is unwilling to even explain why, just watch. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  The American people are going to have some feelings about that too. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=472.32s)]
*  Just watch. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMAESNgO8W4&t=474.76s)]
