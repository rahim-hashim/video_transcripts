# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 10
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc)
*  It was December of 2019. The president was just weeks away from being impeached for the first time. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=0.0s)]
*  It was a stressful, chaotic time for the White House. And yet, President Trump's mind was elsewhere. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=6.24s)]
*  We have a situation where we're looking very strongly at sinks and showers [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=14.64s)]
*  and other elements of bathrooms. People are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  as opposed to once. They end up using more water. So EPA is looking at that very strongly, at my suggestion. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=26.32s)]
*  Now, in this job that I am privileged to have, I have traveled all over this country, literally. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=35.28s)]
*  I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people about the problems that they've got [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  in their everyday lives. And not once has anyone told me that they wish the president of the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=44.16s)]
*  United States would increase the internal velocity of their toilets or the water coming out of their [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=50.160000000000004s)]
*  sinks. But for a while, it was something Donald Trump was kind of obsessed with. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=55.68s)]
*  I said sinks, showers, and toilets. It's the shower, it's the sink. I won't talk about the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  fact that people have to flush their toilet 15 times. Dishwashers, sinks, toilets, sinks, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  toilets, and showers. We won't talk about toilets, toilets, toilets, sinks, right, showers, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=78.16000000000001s)]
*  and what goes with a sink and a shower? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=88.72000000000001s)]
*  Truly the oddest call and response of all time, making the audience scream toilets back at you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=93.84s)]
*  Here's the thing, I don't really care why Donald Trump was obsessed with toilets. To be perfectly [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=101.84s)]
*  honest, I don't really want to know why or where he got involved in discussions about having to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=106.64s)]
*  flush toilets 15 times. Unfortunately, though, the former president's bizarre predilection for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=112.08s)]
*  toilets is in fact in the news today. And as a serious journalist, it is my duty to tell you [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=117.92s)]
*  about it. According to the New York Times reporter, Maggie Haberman, when Donald Trump was president, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=123.44s)]
*  his staff used to periodically find wads of printed paper clogging the White House toilets. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=129.2s)]
*  They believed President Trump was purposely attempting to flush pieces of paper down the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  toilet. The former president immediately poo-pooed these ideas, reporting saying that he never put [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=141.92s)]
*  presidential records in a toilet, which is definitely a thing I cannot believe that I just said on TV. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=148.32s)]
*  But Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Jacobs confirmed the reporting with her own sources, too. She says [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=154.0s)]
*  that Trump staffers would try to fish clumped, torn, and shredded papers out of the White House [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=160.0s)]
*  toilet. Who knows, maybe that's why the president was so obsessed with the fire power of the network [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=166.88s)]
*  of toilets in this country. What this reporting does make clear, though, is that Donald Trump has [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=173.28s)]
*  certainly deployed a diverse range of tactics for destroying presidential records. We've been [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=178.64s)]
*  following the reporting all week about how Donald Trump reportedly ripped out White House records [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=183.68s)]
*  during his time in office, despite being required by law to preserve all documents that come across [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=187.92s)]
*  his desk. Staffers had to try and jigsaw them back together, taping them back together. Other [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  documents were just destroyed entirely, put into burn bags. Didn't even know what burn bags were. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=199.2s)]
*  They were put into burn bags for staffers to decide what to keep, what to shred, and potentially what [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=204.48s)]
*  to burn. One of the president's former aides, Omarosa Manigault Newman, told me on my show on Sunday [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  that she once even saw Donald Trump chewing up the remains of a document he had shredded [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=216.24s)]
*  in the Oval Office. He literally put the paper in his mouth to destroy it. A germaphobe, by the way, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=221.68s)]
*  didn't put much in his mouth. Just today, the New York Times reported that the January 6th [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  investigation in Congress has found gaps in the official White House telephone logs on the day of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=232.88s)]
*  the Capitol attack. This week, the Washington Post has reported that he also improperly took 15 boxes [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  of materials to Mar-a-Lago, which had to be later retrieved by the National Archives. And tonight, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=245.12s)]
*  the Washington Post is out with a huge scoop about what exactly was in those 15 boxes. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=251.12s)]
*  Here's the lead. Quote, some of the White House documents that Donald Trump [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=259.36s)]
*  improperly took to his Mar-a-Lago residence were clearly marked as classified, including documents [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=262.96s)]
*  at the top secret level, according to two people familiar with the matter. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=269.76s)]
*  While it was unclear how many classified documents were among those received by the National Archives [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=274.32s)]
*  and Records Administration, some bore markings that the information was extremely sensitive [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=279.68s)]
*  and would be limited to a small group of officials with authority to view such highly classified [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=285.04s)]
*  information. End quote. The handling of sensitive classified information is a highly regulated thing. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=290.48s)]
*  Mishandling that kind of material is against the law, which leads me to the other piece of [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  explosive reporting in the Post tonight that the National Archives has now asked the Justice [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  Department to look into this matter to see if anyone should be potentially prosecuted for stowing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=309.12s)]
*  top secret documents at the former president's beach resort. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=314.8s)]
*  Gelatin. Gelatin. Gelatin is the jiggly wiggly stuff that makes your jello and your gummy candy [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  goes in a whole lot of other foods and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. It's in a lot of stuff. It's big business [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  and most of it is made from animal products. So about 15 years ago, a guy from Wisconsin went down [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  to Mississippi with a plan to make gelatin out of catfish waste, all the stuff that's left over from [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=340.72s)]
*  catfish processing, the stuff that would just typically be thrown away. This guy and his business [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=347.04s)]
*  partner brought in all these potential investors and told them this business plan was a sure bet. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=352.48s)]
*  There was nothing they didn't know about making gelatin out of catfish waste. The gelatin was [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=359.44s)]
*  perfected and ready to be sold. They already had a three million dollar contract set up with a buyer [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=365.36s)]
*  for it. Sounded great. Investors handed over hundreds of thousands of dollars to the project. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=371.6s)]
*  The state of Mississippi also gave them hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants. They also got a [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=377.28s)]
*  loan from a bank and for a while things seemed to be going well, at least as far as the investors knew. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=383.84s)]
*  The guy running the gelatin from catfish waste company was sending them emails and letters, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=391.11999999999995s)]
*  telling them how well things were going, telling them the company quote, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=395.91999999999996s)]
*  is producing product, shipping and invoicing customers. We have contracted orders from two [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=400.0s)]
*  large customers totaling 3000 metric tons per year. We've completely sold out of gelatin [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=406.24s)]
*  at a good price, end quote. The U.S. Navy's interested in our amazing catfish waste into [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=414.8s)]
*  gelatin process. Oh and hey, by the way, we've just signed a contract for over a million dollars with [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=421.12s)]
*  a new processor, plus we're going to get 50% of the profits from that new second processing plan. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=426.24s)]
*  But we're just a little short on liquid cash to get over the hump till that second plant is open, so [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=434.08s)]
*  if you all could chip in $25,000 more a piece or more if you're feeling generous, that would be great. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=440.16s)]
*  And so the investors kicked in more cash. But guess what? And I bet you can probably guess [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=448.24s)]
*  where this is going. Yeah, there was no new processor or second plant. There were no million [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=455.44s)]
*  dollar contracts. In fact, there was barely even any gelatin. There was a whole lot of catfish waste. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=461.68s)]
*  From court documents, they were quote, never able to manufacture a sellable product, often pouring [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=469.04s)]
*  the results of their attempts in a ditch behind the plant. In fact, they were only able to make [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=474.16s)]
*  viable batches of the product a couple of times. As a result, the company had no customers and never [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=479.68s)]
*  made any sales, end quote. An investor testified that he asked the guy running the company why he [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  did not tell the investors the truth in these letters he was sending out, to which the guy [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=492.08s)]
*  replied, quote, they can't handle the truth. Now, I said these were court documents because ultimately [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  federal prosecutors brought multiple felony charges against this guy and his catfish waste [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=503.44s)]
*  to gelatin scheme that bilked investors and a bank out of their money. He always maintained his [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=508.79999999999995s)]
*  innocence, but ultimately he was convicted on mail fraud and bank fraud charges, ordered to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=514.88s)]
*  pay about $2 million and sentenced to 70 months in prison. He was released in 2014, but recently [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=519.36s)]
*  he's been peddling a new project. This was the headline in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=528.08s)]
*  summer. A Wisconsin man is scanning ballots and suing a county clerk as he launches his own [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=534.88s)]
*  election review. The story that follows is as nutty as the headline sounds. To be clear, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=541.28s)]
*  there is also an investigation launched by Wisconsin Republicans into the 2020 election, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=547.76s)]
*  run by a guy who says the election was stolen and who's hired Trump administration officials [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=553.12s)]
*  as his investigators. That investigation is ongoing to the tune of at least many hundreds of [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=558.0799999999999s)]
*  thousands of taxpayer dollars. But this is not that. This was just a random guy tooling around, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=564.0s)]
*  making copies of ballots because he decided to run his own private freelance election [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=572.88s)]
*  investigation. And once the local press cottoned onto what he was doing, it didn't take long for [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=579.04s)]
*  them to realize that the guy wandering the state copying ballots for his own freelance investigation [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=584.0s)]
*  was in fact our friend who went to prison for his catfish waste into gelatin scam. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=589.68s)]
*  And look, this guy has served his time. He's paid his debt to society, even if as of 2020, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=596.4s)]
*  he apparently hadn't paid back much of the nearly $2 million that he also owes in restitution. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=602.8s)]
*  And I suppose if he wants to travel the state of Wisconsin making copies of ballots, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=609.3599999999999s)]
*  it's a free country. And apparently that is something you are free to do in Wisconsin. Help [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=613.68s)]
*  yourself. But by this December, things had kind of escalated. In a December lawsuit, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=618.48s)]
*  he accused the director of elections in Milwaukee of being part of a quote, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=624.88s)]
*  sect that planned, conspired, and implemented a massive election fraud by using fake names and [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=630.0s)]
*  fake addresses to cast ballots. He claimed that this sect allowed somebody to print ballots for [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=637.04s)]
*  Biden in a back conference room. His filing included a hand drawn floor plan of an election [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=643.44s)]
*  office with a spot labeled quote, hidden room. Someone was sleeping, snoring. And now that guy, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=650.32s)]
*  the catfish waste into gelatin scam, make copies of all the ballots. There's a secret sect in a [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=659.6s)]
*  hidden room printing ballots for Biden guy. That guy, well, he was invited by Republicans to give [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=664.6400000000001s)]
*  a presentation to the state's assembly elections committee. Someone is using, we don't know who, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=672.0s)]
*  someone is using our systems, our databases to cast illegal ballots. We have found tens of [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=679.36s)]
*  thousands. We don't know who's doing it. It's probably not the person who's the name. It's [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=684.8s)]
*  probably some bad guys. Something's wrong. Somebody's in there. Somebody's doing something [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=691.68s)]
*  wrong casting illegal ballots. Somebody's in there. They're adding names. They're adding fake [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=697.92s)]
*  voters. They're casting illegal ballots by the tens of thousands. So I appreciate your time [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=703.76s)]
*  and thank you for having me here today. They're adding fake voters. They're casting illegal [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=710.8s)]
*  ballots by the tens of thousands. We don't know who's doing it, but it's bad guys. Bad guys [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=718.88s)]
*  are doing it. And he should know he's got thousands of volunteers and a supercomputer [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=725.36s)]
*  working on this stuff. This is what Republicans on the elections committee are doing in Wisconsin [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=730.64s)]
*  right now. I will say there are a couple of Democrats on that committee. They tried valiantly [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=736.96s)]
*  to pin this guy down on something. He was a bit like gelatin. It was tough going. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=742.4s)]
*  You did say that there were people who told you or told your group that they had showed up to vote [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=747.12s)]
*  at the polls and were told that someone had already voted in their name. Do you have either [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=755.84s)]
*  for us or for law enforcement affidavits from those people detailing those issues? What we do [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=761.44s)]
*  is we encourage those people, many of them are afraid to come forward, but we have found [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=768.8s)]
*  hundreds and hundreds of them. None of them would sign an affidavit. I would say none, but [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=774.08s)]
*  say if we have 500, maybe a dozen. I take five. Yeah. No, I don't have them. No, I don't. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=780.0s)]
*  The poor state assemblyman. Do you have any evidence? Maybe five people? Maybe one person? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=789.2800000000001s)]
*  Nope. Sorry. You're just going to have to take my word for it. We also reached out to this gentleman [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=794.96s)]
*  this evening to ask if he could provide us with any evidence. He didn't respond to our request for [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=799.52s)]
*  comment. I am now officially out of my depth. Joining me is Dan Goldman. He is the former [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=804.0799999999999s)]
*  assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. He served as the House [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=810.0799999999999s)]
*  majority counsel during Donald Trump's first impeachment trial. Daniel, I'm okay with the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=814.3199999999999s)]
*  plunger and the toilet side of this equation. I don't understand the rest of it. Please help us [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=819.52s)]
*  out here. Certainly, Ali. From my experience on the House Intelligence Committee where [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=823.92s)]
*  everyone needed to have top secret clearance, there are very, very carefully choreographed [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=828.8s)]
*  methods to protect classified information. Classified information, particularly top secret [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=835.92s)]
*  information, does not leave a secured classified area. If it does, you put it in a bag with a lock [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  on it. There are really, really detailed and careful procedures to make sure that no classified [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=851.84s)]
*  material is ever left out to the public for anyone without top secret or secret or whatever [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=858.96s)]
*  classification clearance that is necessary. It doesn't really matter on one level as to who [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=866.24s)]
*  was ultimately responsible for bringing those boxes down to Mar-a-Lago because almost certainly [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=875.76s)]
*  whatever was in those boxes should not have been classified information. Now, the president himself [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=883.2s)]
*  does have the right and the authority to declassify documents, but he doesn't just wave a wand in the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=890.64s)]
*  air and say, oh, that's what I'm going to do. This document is declassified. That document is [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=897.6s)]
*  declassified. All of these documents have very clear markings on them. They'll say, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=903.28s)]
*  secret, top secret, and a variety of other markings. One of those markings would be declassified or it [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=909.6s)]
*  would cross over the classification markings from earlier if it were to be declassified. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=918.8s)]
*  There's a process and the fact of there being top secret documents in random boxes in Mar-a-Lago [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=927.12s)]
*  is in and of itself mishandling of classified information. What we don't know is who did that, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=935.76s)]
*  who was responsible for it. Presumably Donald Trump was not packing his own boxes, but was he aware [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=942.24s)]
*  of what was in them and who else was aware who oversaw this? That's where the Department of [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=948.48s)]
*  Justice and the FBI need to get involved because even if there's no criminal investigation or [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=953.92s)]
*  criminal prosecution that arises from this, it is a national security issue and the FBI's [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=959.76s)]
*  counterintelligence division needs to figure out what happened. Does this fall under the purview [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=966.16s)]
*  of the January 6th investigation or is this an FBI Justice Department matter? No, and there was [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=972.16s)]
*  in the report it also says that even when they uncovered the top secret information and relayed [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=977.36s)]
*  that to the FBI, the FBI was still figuring out what they should do with it. But I do think it's [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=983.68s)]
*  important to put this in perspective. The classification issues related to the stuff [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  that was in the documents, the Presidential Records Act violation is not something that really falls [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=996.4s)]
*  within the purview of the January 6th committee. The House Oversight Committee under Chairwoman [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1004.0799999999999s)]
*  Carolyn Maloney has announced an investigation into that issue. That is separate from the January [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1010.08s)]
*  6th investigation. What I think is important and that overlaps a lot with this Presidential Records [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1015.6800000000001s)]
*  Act and the January 6th committee investigation is two things. One is the fact that there are very [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1023.12s)]
*  few call logs from the day of January 6th is an issue. What happened was Donald Trump intentionally [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1031.1200000000001s)]
*  concealing conversations that he was having with people through his aides, personal cell phones [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1038.24s)]
*  that are not protected and are not supposed to be used. Or where was he when he was having these [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1045.68s)]
*  conversations? Because we know that he also was sneaking people in the side door for meetings [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1054.0s)]
*  prior to January 6th. And then the other thing that I think is very important here and is a [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1059.28s)]
*  continuation of a pattern that we've seen from Donald Trump is the destruction of these documents. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1064.24s)]
*  Whether he ripped them up, tore them up, ate them, flushed them down the toilet or whatever it is, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1070.32s)]
*  he is destroying Presidential Records. Now that's a violation of the Presidential Records Act. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1075.36s)]
*  But this is also someone who obstructed the Mueller investigation, who obstructed the first [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1080.88s)]
*  impeachment investigation that I worked on and has a history of obstructing investigations, of trying [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1087.2s)]
*  to hide what we can only assume now is misconduct because of the pattern and practice of doing that. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1094.24s)]
*  And so the question then becomes what is he ripping up? What is he tearing? What is he trying to hide? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1101.68s)]
*  And presumably that falls under the January 6th investigation. This is the Graceful. She is a [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1108.0s)]
*  100 million dollar super yacht the length of three basketball courts. According to the website Boke [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1117.28s)]
*  International, she has an indoor pool that can be converted into a dance hall, a drop-down screen [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1123.04s)]
*  and projector for private ocean movie screenings, a helideck to land your helicopter, a gym, a cocktail [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1129.12s)]
*  bar and a spa pool alongside another two plunge pools for either hot or cold dips. Back in September, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1136.1599999999999s)]
*  the Graceful docked at a German shipyard for some upgrades. She was there to be retrofitted with two [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1143.92s)]
*  brand new balconies and an extended swimming platform. But then suddenly this week, German [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1150.0s)]
*  media reported that the Graceful was departing that shipyard unexpectedly before workers could [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1155.92s)]
*  finish their upgrades. And this is important because the Russian owner of the Graceful [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1162.08s)]
*  is believed to be none other than the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Putin's luxury party [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1168.32s)]
*  boat was relocated from German waters into Russian territory, leading some to believe [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1174.48s)]
*  that the Russian president is trying to get the boat out of NATO controlled seas so that it cannot [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1179.6s)]
*  be seized as part of any U.S. and European sanctions following a Russian incursion into Ukraine. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  Now, we do not know for sure if this is Vladimir Putin's boat and whether he decided to move his [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1193.04s)]
*  big nautical nightclub. But as Rachel would say, watch this space or watch that boat. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc-EboRUcQc&t=1198.72s)]
