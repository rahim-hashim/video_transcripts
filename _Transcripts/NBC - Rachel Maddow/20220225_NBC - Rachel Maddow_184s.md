# Anti-War Protests In Russia Test Putin's Dictator Privilege
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts)
*  One of the rough truths of kleptocracy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=0.0s)]
*  of being a kleptocratic dictator, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=4.0s)]
*  is that even very poor nations can produce very rich kleptocrats. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=7.0s)]
*  Right? Even a very poor country. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=12.0s)]
*  If the guy at the top steals everything, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=14.0s)]
*  the guy at the top is still going to be very rich. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=16.0s)]
*  You don't need a well-off country to make a well-off thief. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=18.0s)]
*  Sanctions that impose economic pain on Russia [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=24.0s)]
*  will ultimately impose no economic pain on him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=27.0s)]
*  He will stay one of the richest men to have ever walked the face of the Earth, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=30.0s)]
*  no matter how much the rest of the Russian economy and the Russian people suffers. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=33.0s)]
*  And does he care about economic pain for his people? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=37.0s)]
*  Well, he doesn't really have to. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=40.0s)]
*  As long as he can sustain the dictatorship, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=42.0s)]
*  he's not susceptible to any democratic consequences from his own people's unhappiness. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=44.0s)]
*  I mean, what are they going to do? Vote him out? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=49.0s)]
*  Look, though. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=54.0s)]
*  This was, I think, a piece of this today that not... [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=55.0s)]
*  that nobody could have predicted with confidence. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=60.0s)]
*  Look at the protests against what Putin did today inside Russia. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=64.0s)]
*  Look at this. This is St. Petersburg, Russia, today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=70.0s)]
*  Look at all those people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=73.0s)]
*  Russian authorities put out dire, dire warnings today, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=76.0s)]
*  threatening the Russian people that anybody demonstrating, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=80.0s)]
*  anybody protesting, anybody saying anything against Putin's invasion of Ukraine [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=83.0s)]
*  would be treated as a rioter, would essentially be treated as a terrorist. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=88.0s)]
*  But look, look at the people turning out in St. Petersburg, in Moscow. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=92.0s)]
*  I mean, here's the lead story tonight in the Associated Press. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=97.0s)]
*  Dateline Moscow shocked Russians, turned out by the thousands today, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=99.0s)]
*  to decry their country's invasion of Ukraine, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=103.0s)]
*  as emotional calls for protests grew on social media. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=106.0s)]
*  Some 1,745 people in 54 different Russian cities were arrested today. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=109.0s)]
*  54 different Russian cities? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=117.0s)]
*  At least 957 arrests today in Moscow alone. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=122.0s)]
*  The Russian people have no say in the behavior of their government under the Putin dictatorship. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=129.0s)]
*  He has criminalized standing against him in elections. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=135.0s)]
*  He's criminalized even journalism about him. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=138.0s)]
*  He has criminalized human rights work. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=140.0s)]
*  He has criminalized history. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=142.0s)]
*  He has criminalized all protest. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=144.0s)]
*  A single person standing holding a single protest sign is considered to be a riot in Moscow. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=146.0s)]
*  And yet, the Russian people, by the thousands, by the thousands, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=153.0s)]
*  still took to the streets today to say, no, they can't bear it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=157.0s)]
*  They cannot bear him starting this war. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUM7mjRJ1ts&t=159.0s)]
