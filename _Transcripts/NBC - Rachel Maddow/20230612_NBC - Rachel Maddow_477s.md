Video Description: Ron Liebman, former assistant U.S. attorney who served on the team that prosecuted former Vice President Spiro Agnew, talks with Rachel Maddow about parallels between the Agnew and Trump cases and why why the kind of plea deal that kept Agnew out of office and out of jail may not be available for someone facing as much legal heat as Donald Trump.

# Trump legal hole may be too deep to plead his way out: former Agnew prosecutor
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U)
*  The three federal prosecutors from Baltimore who ran the Agnew investigation, who amassed all the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=0.0s)]
*  evidence against him, enough to put him in jail for a long time before the plea deal let him escape [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  jail in exchange for leaving public service. Those three prosecutors are Barney Skolnick, Tim Baker, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=11.44s)]
*  and Ron Liebman. If anyone in the whole country has ever been here before, it's these guys. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=18.64s)]
*  Joining us now live is one of those men from the center of that story, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=24.96s)]
*  Ron Liebman, former assistant U.S. attorney in Baltimore. Mr. Liebman, it's nice to see you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=29.12s)]
*  Thank you for being here tonight. Great pleasure to be here. Thank you. First, let me just ask you [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=33.36s)]
*  if I got anything wrong there. I know I didn't tell the whole story, but the parts of it that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=39.04s)]
*  I told, did I get anything wrong or the wrong way around? No, no, you got it right. You got it right. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=42.64s)]
*  It is a bedrock principle that no one is above the law. There's only one system of law for [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=48.24s)]
*  everybody. How did you guys square that with the fact that Agnew had this very valuable thing to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=53.36s)]
*  trade effectively? He had his public office to trade to keep himself from going to jail. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=61.6s)]
*  That is something that nobody else would have. Well, my team members, Barney Skolnick, Tim Baker, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=68.4s)]
*  and I argued vociferously for days with the attorney general and his staff about this very [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=75.76s)]
*  point. We felt strongly, very strongly, that Agnew wasn't above the law. He committed crimes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=83.84s)]
*  He should go to trial. He gets convicted. He gets acquitted. He gets his day in court. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=92.72s)]
*  And the attorney general, Elliot Richardson, to his credit gave us as much time as we wanted. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=97.92s)]
*  We argued with him for days. And we finally, the three of us, finally came to the conclusion [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  that he was right, that he had the maturity of judgment at the time, given what was going on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=112.48s)]
*  to approve this deal. Agnew had a get out of jail card. He was in elective office. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=119.28s)]
*  Anyone could see that Richard Nixon was not long for that office. And so there would be the specter [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  of the vice president under indictment, perhaps at trial, perhaps convicted, becoming the president [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=133.6s)]
*  of the United States. And then because of Justice Department policy, not law, he would be immune [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=141.12s)]
*  from prosecution while he was in office. This is in the middle of Watergate. The country was in a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=147.76s)]
*  constitutional crisis. We, the three of us, Barney, Timmy, and I finally came around [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=154.48s)]
*  to understanding and agreeing that at the time, what was going on there, that was the right call. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=161.12s)]
*  Donald Trump is a contender. He's not in elective office. He may become the Republican nominee. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=168.16s)]
*  His betting is that he will. He may or may not get elected at the time of the election. If he is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=176.88s)]
*  the Republican nominee, even if he is elected, he could have been tried for this espionage case. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=183.68s)]
*  He could well have other indictments pending against him. It could even be possible that he [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=190.0s)]
*  would be convicted and sentenced to jail, and you'd have the specter. And here's where there's a [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=196.88s)]
*  similarity. Rachel, you'd have the specter of President Trump running the White House while [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=200.88s)]
*  doing time in the big house. That would be terrible. However, it's not Watergate. We're [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=207.68s)]
*  not in a constitutional crisis. The fact that Trump would become president if there's a fair [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=214.4s)]
*  election and he's elected, I know for Mr. Trump, it's only a fair election if he wins. But if [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  there's a fair election and he becomes president, that's democracy. He becomes president. It doesn't [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=228.32s)]
*  mean he stays president. It depends on what he does. He is likely to be wrathful and vindictive. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=234.0s)]
*  He will certainly try to kick the wheels off of the Lady Liberty's wagon. He doesn't necessarily [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=241.36s)]
*  remain president. He could be impeached depending upon what Congress is in session. There's the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=248.88s)]
*  25th Amendment that could be used. So there are similarities, but I think there are fundamental [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=254.72s)]
*  differences as well. Trump is not in office now. He is a contender. There are a lot of moving parts [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=260.08s)]
*  to this, and we'll have to see what happens. I do think, and I know that my colleagues think, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=269.52s)]
*  that we made the right decision at the right time for what was going on. These times are a bit [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  different, and there's a lot to play out yet. And Ron, in terms of the, when you say you and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=281.44s)]
*  your colleagues believe that was the right decision at the right time, in terms of your [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=286.08s)]
*  understanding of the legacy of the Agnew decision within the Justice Department, is that viewed as [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=291.2s)]
*  having been the wise decision? I ask only because we have to think now about whether the Justice [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=296.24s)]
*  Department might be considering something along those same lines in any potential plea negotiation [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=303.84s)]
*  with former President Trump. Obviously, anything can be part of a plea negotiation. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=311.6s)]
*  An agreement to not stand for public office would be somewhat parallel to the sort of agreement [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=317.44000000000005s)]
*  that came with Agnew in terms of him resigning the office he then held. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=323.44000000000005s)]
*  I think the Justice Department, to answer the first part of your question, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  felt that the plea agreement with Agnew was the right thing. In terms of a plea agreement with [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=332.88s)]
*  Donald Trump, first of all, keep in mind that he is the Roy Cohn school of behavior, so [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=341.68s)]
*  he fights everything no matter what, no matter where to the very end. Anyone who [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  bosses him or he thinks bosses him, he goes after. It's very likely that he actually will go to trial [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=356.16s)]
*  thinking that that only enhances his chances of getting elected because of how his base will [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=363.6s)]
*  react. But if he were to, for the same kind of reasons I think that Agnew had, not want to go [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=370.08s)]
*  to jail. I mean, nobody wants to go to jail. White-collar defendants really don't want to go [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=378.32s)]
*  to jail. They don't want to do time. So if he would authorize his lawyers, let's say hypothetically, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=383.28s)]
*  to offer an Agnew-like plea deal wherein Trump would agree for a global settlement, which [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  with all the cases that are pending, I don't know how that would work. But let's say he would say, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=397.11999999999995s)]
*  tell his lawyers, I will agree not to run for office if you drop these charges against me or [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  I can plead no contendere to some jaywalking offense. I'm not sure the Justice Department [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=407.76s)]
*  would, in this context, would go along with that. I hope they wouldn't because that feeds into the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=414.32s)]
*  rhetoric that the prosecution, that the Department of Justice is bringing is a weaponization. It's [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=420.24s)]
*  illegitimate prosecution just so that Donald Trump won't run for office again. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=428.08s)]
*  That's a different situation than Agnew, I believe. And I don't think the Justice [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=433.68s)]
*  Department, I hope they wouldn't agree to do that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=438.56s)]
*  CONSUELO MACKENZIE-MORELL, Former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=441.12s)]
*  a member of the team that prosecuted Spiro Agnew, a man with a place in history. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=445.28s)]
*  Ron, it's really good to have you here tonight. Thank you so much for talking to us about this. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=450.8s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. Pleasure to be here. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pN5j7vGl1U&t=454.4s)]
