# Exclusive: Stormy Daniels talks about the harsh reality of being the star witness against Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4)
*  Stormy, thank you so much for doing this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=2.44s)]
*  You do not have to do this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=3.44s)]
*  I was very surprised that you agreed to do it, but I've been really looking forward to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=4.44s)]
*  talking to you for a long time. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=8.64s)]
*  I guess I mostly just want to know how the last few weeks have been. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=12.72s)]
*  This has been a many year saga for you, but this is a qualitatively different time since [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=16.96s)]
*  the conviction has been a few weeks. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=21.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's been a lot. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  It's been intense. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=25.92s)]
*  I think that part of that comes from my mistake of in my mind thinking that this would be [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=26.92s)]
*  an ending, that this would be the light at the end of the tunnel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  This was what I was working towards, that it would be like a movie when the judge hits [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=38.52s)]
*  the gavel, the credits roll, and it would be tied up in a nice little gift bow and it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=42.6s)]
*  would be done. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=46.36s)]
*  But that's not how real life works. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=47.36s)]
*  And my friends were celebrating and sending me messages and texts, not just friends, like [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=51.24s)]
*  everybody, people who were happy that the verdict came down and it was over. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=57.72s)]
*  But meanwhile, I knew that for me, it was just getting started because for every person [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=63.8s)]
*  that was excited and thrilled and congratulating me, there was somebody else that was very [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=69.84s)]
*  upset. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=75.28s)]
*  And it just poured gasoline on some of that stuff that I had been going through the entire [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=77.16000000000001s)]
*  time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  And it's kind of common knowledge now that a lot of the people were doxxed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  I know that Cohen was doxxed. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=90.84s)]
*  They're trying to doxx jurors and judges were doxxed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=92.84s)]
*  I was doxxed. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=95.4s)]
*  And I know that it's directly related because it happened while I was literally still on [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  the stand. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=101.4s)]
*  What's the consequence for you of having your address out there? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=102.4s)]
*  My mailbox was destroyed. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=106.9s)]
*  My animals have been injured. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=109.78s)]
*  My daughter can't go outside. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=112.26s)]
*  There's press and looky-loos out there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=113.38000000000001s)]
*  I'm afraid to go outside. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=118.86000000000001s)]
*  I'm afraid to go out and mow the lawn. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  I can't go anywhere. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=126.78s)]
*  I'm afraid of being followed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=127.78s)]
*  The death threats are so much more graphic and detailed and brazen. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=128.78s)]
*  People don't care. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=136.3s)]
*  And it's scary. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=138.74s)]
*  And leading up to the trial was hard enough. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=140.9s)]
*  Flying up here repeatedly and sitting in the rooms and going through things and reliving [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=144.18s)]
*  all these terrifying moments. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=148.3s)]
*  The only thing that kept me going, I guess, was thinking that there was an end in sight. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=151.08s)]
*  And there's not. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=154.86s)]
*  Is there any sense of vindication? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=156.58s)]
*  Trump being convicted, this is not a case that you brought. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=163.18s)]
*  This is a case that prosecutors brought. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=165.7s)]
*  You were brought here as a witness to testify for it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=166.98s)]
*  You were subpoenaed to testify. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=169.42s)]
*  You had no choice about it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=170.42s)]
*  Again, not your case. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=171.66s)]
*  That said, the way the case was presented to the jury, I mean, the prosecutor described [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=173.74s)]
*  to the jury in his closing argument, Stormy Daniels is the motive, saying how crucial [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=180.38s)]
*  your testimony was. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=184.94s)]
*  Your testimony was not only riveting, it was absolutely integral to the case. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=187.74s)]
*  Does the verdict sort of feel like a vindication to you, at least in the sense that the story [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=193.26s)]
*  is straight now that the jury has agreed that he was wrong when he called you a liar? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=196.14s)]
*  Yes, but no. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=200.98s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  Life is not fair. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=209.54s)]
*  And I am getting constantly attacked. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=211.42s)]
*  It was called Stormy Daniels' hush money trial. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=213.1s)]
*  And that's not what it was. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  It was about the falsification of business records. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=216.45999999999998s)]
*  And mine was just one thing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  But that was the most exciting part. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=221.54s)]
*  And I was the one that took the stand. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=223.78s)]
*  I was the one that I think testimony made such an impact. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=226.26s)]
*  There were so many other people they could have called. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  They didn't call Karen McDougall. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=231.7s)]
*  So as I've indicated, when he was found guilty for that brief moment, it was worth me testifying [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=234.98s)]
*  because at first I wasn't going to. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=241.14s)]
*  And I had to shut down my life. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=243.06s)]
*  I was basically my choice sequestered. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=244.82s)]
*  I didn't work. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  I didn't tweet. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  If you know me, that's a big deal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  I didn't tweet because I didn't want anything to be misconstrued or entered into evidence [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=250.52s)]
*  and create more work for the prosecution or get the case thrown out or just allow me from [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  testifying. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=261.08s)]
*  Did I want to testify? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=262.08s)]
*  No. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=264.08s)]
*  Do you know how scary that is? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=265.08s)]
*  Especially once I got up there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=267.12s)]
*  If I had known beforehand how nasty Susan Eccles was going to be to me, I might not have. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=268.36s)]
*  But I also knew that if I didn't testify, that it would look like they didn't want me [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  to and that I was not to be trusted. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  That there was a reason that they didn't want me to testify. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=280.56s)]
*  So I knew that I had to and that it was important. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=283.04s)]
*  And as soon as he was found guilty, I knew that I had done the right thing in one aspect. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  The other side of that is, like you said, I didn't bring these charges. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=291.38s)]
*  I didn't ask for it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  I was subpoenaed. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  So much of the hate mail that I get is, drop the charges. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=298.48s)]
*  I didn't sue him. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=302.8s)]
*  I'm getting nothing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=303.8s)]
*  It cost me so much to come up here and testify. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  I was not paid. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=308.0s)]
*  I'm a registered Republican. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=309.16s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=310.72s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=311.72s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=312.72s)]
*  Just like, get out. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=313.72s)]
*  When you say you paid to come up here, you paid your own expenses to come testify. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=314.72s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=318.56s)]
*  Multiple times. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=319.56s)]
*  I wasn't like compensated or written a check or anything like that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=320.56s)]
*  I got nothing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=325.12s)]
*  And this has cost me so much money. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=326.12s)]
*  I wasn't paid by anybody. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=329.12s)]
*  My testimony that I was subpoenaed, that everybody considers me to have done this great duty [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=330.84s)]
*  and be a hero, which I'm not. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=335.6s)]
*  I just told the truth. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=337.8s)]
*  I just, I was just a human being. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=338.8s)]
*  I didn't do anything heroic. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=340.52s)]
*  I didn't go into a burning building. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=341.8s)]
*  I didn't, you know, I just said the truth. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=343.28s)]
*  And I've never changed my story, despite what other people said. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=347.8s)]
*  Go back, look at interviews online from 2019, 2020, 2021. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=351.64s)]
*  My story hasn't changed at all. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=357.24s)]
*  It's the only one that has been consistent. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  Let me ask you about that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=362.0s)]
*  What you're saying is, was very much what the prosecutor said in the closing argument. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=364.2s)]
*  And I just want to, I want to ask you about the way that the prosecution, for lack of [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  a better word, used you, the way that you fit into their case, because I want to hear [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=373.44s)]
*  from you whether or not you agree with that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=377.08s)]
*  I want to sort of give you your voice to say about it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  He said, the defense has gone to great lengths to discredit Stormy Daniels on her account [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=380.91999999999996s)]
*  of her sexual involvement with this, with Mr. Trump. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=385.0s)]
*  They shamed her. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=387.4s)]
*  They have tried to suggest that her story has changed over the years. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=388.4s)]
*  It has not, at least not in any way that's significant. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=390.8s)]
*  To be sure, there were parts of her testimony that were cringeworthy, but that whole episode [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=393.72s)]
*  in the suite at Harris, that was uncomfortable. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=397.76s)]
*  Some of the details about what the suite looked like, the contents of his toiletry bag, the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=400.58s)]
*  topics of conversation, those are the kind of details I submit to you that kind of ring [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=404.16s)]
*  true, that the kind of details you would expect someone to remember. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=409.0s)]
*  If she didn't testify about those details, it would undoubtedly give the defense more [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=411.56s)]
*  ammunition in their efforts to call her a liar, to argue that she was never in that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=415.56s)]
*  hotel room. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=419.68s)]
*  Now, in his opening and his closing, Trump's lawyer, Mr. Blanche, told you that Ms. Daniels' [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=420.76s)]
*  testimony doesn't matter. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=424.48s)]
*  That's a bridge too far, because it's certainly true that we don't have to prove that sex [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=426.52s)]
*  actually took place. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  That's not an element of the crimes charged, but the defendant, Trump, knew what happened [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=431.76s)]
*  in that hotel room. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=435.8s)]
*  And to the extent that you credit Stormy Daniels' testimony, that only reinforces his incentive [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=437.0s)]
*  to buy her silence. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=441.92s)]
*  The defense knows that, because if her testimony were so irrelevant, why did they work so hard [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=443.56s)]
*  to discredit her? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=448.52s)]
*  What I'm saying is that her story is messy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=449.88s)]
*  It makes some people uncomfortable to hear. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=451.84s)]
*  It probably made some of you, meaning the jury, uncomfortable to hear. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=453.84s)]
*  But that's kind of the point. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=457.56s)]
*  That's the display the defendant didn't want the American voter to see. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=462.64s)]
*  That is why your testimony was not just an amazing display, but also American history, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=467.23999999999995s)]
*  the way that fits into this. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=473.38s)]
*  Do you agree with the way they characterized you in this case? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=475.2s)]
*  The prosecution? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=479.04s)]
*  The way that he's saying your testimony functioned and why it was relevant to this crime. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=480.92s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=485.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=486.08s)]
*  Why would I make some of that stuff up? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=487.08s)]
*  And you know, yeah, yeah, I am. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=488.8s)]
*  And I'm comfortable with it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=492.08s)]
*  And for those people out there who were like, oh, they let her get up there and say whatever [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=493.48s)]
*  she wanted. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=496.68s)]
*  And I was, keep in mind, I did nothing but answer the questions. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=498.28s)]
*  I didn't go up there and present an essay to a spoken word theater. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=501.96s)]
*  You know, it was, I answered questions. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=506.24s)]
*  And if you don't want to hear the answer, don't ask me the questions. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=508.4s)]
*  And for those people who said it was uncomfortable to witness or to hear, I lived it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=510.91999999999996s)]
*  All you had to do is hear my very PG rated version on the stand. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=516.88s)]
*  I had to relive it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=521.92s)]
*  I had to say it in court in front of all these people, knowing that it would be public record [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=522.92s)]
*  that my daughter is going to read this, that everybody's going to read this. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=527.92s)]
*  And preparing for the case, remember, I had to go back and think about all these details [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=532.4s)]
*  and make sure that I had everything absolutely accurate. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=536.08s)]
*  And it is important because it proves that I was telling the truth. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=540.2s)]
*  And I don't, maybe this is too far for our conversation right now, but for all those [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=544.84s)]
*  people who like to drag me about talking about what his genitals look like, don't you think [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=547.76s)]
*  for a second that I wish there was something else I could prove? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  I wish he had a birthmark that looked like the state of Texas on his shoulder, you know, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=555.2s)]
*  or funny looking mole. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=559.12s)]
*  That's the only thing that proves that I did, that he did take his clothes off in front [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=561.2s)]
*  of me. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=565.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=566.42s)]
*  And you know as well as I do that if he hadn't, that I was lying, he'd have whipped his junk [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=567.42s)]
*  out a long time ago and proved that I was a liar. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=571.38s)]
*  And it's the only thing I have. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=574.42s)]
*  And he knows I'm telling the truth, which is why he wanted to shut me up. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=577.4599999999999s)]
*  As soon as you were done testifying about what actually happened in the hotel suite, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=583.54s)]
*  Trump's defense lawyers moved for a mistrial. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=587.3399999999999s)]
*  And they said what you had testified and the detail with which you had testified about [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=589.62s)]
*  it was going to be prejudicial to the jury. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=593.0999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't related to the crimes that were charged and the jury hearing that was going [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=595.02s)]
*  to make them have so much improper prejudice toward Trump that the whole trial had to be [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=598.62s)]
*  thrown out. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=602.86s)]
*  And the judge said no to the mistrial and the judge said, listen, you shouldn't have [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=604.54s)]
*  said right at the outset in your opening statement that the sexual encounter never happened. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=610.3s)]
*  That set this case up so that the jury has to assess the credibility of Stormy versus [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=615.5799999999999s)]
*  the defendant. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=619.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they put me on the spot. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=620.8199999999999s)]
*  And so they did that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=621.8199999999999s)]
*  But the detail of that testimony will be the basis of Trump's appeal. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=623.7s)]
*  He will appeal the decision to have not called a mistrial then. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=629.74s)]
*  That's going to be the way that he tries to get out of this conviction. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=632.74s)]
*  Can we go over that test? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=635.94s)]
*  Would you be willing to go through that testimony with me right now? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=637.86s)]
*  There's no cameras on the court. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=640.22s)]
*  Nobody's seen it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=641.22s)]
*  I mean, I printed out that section of the transcript. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=642.22s)]
*  Is this weird? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=645.98s)]
*  Do you mind doing this? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=646.98s)]
*  I've done a lot weirder, trust me. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=647.98s)]
*  I walked right into that one. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd-W3tUnHY4&t=648.98s)]
