# Maddow: Trump's dismantling of independent news media is happening before our eyes
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s)
*  So, there's a newspaper in Long Island, New York, that's called Newsday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=0.0s)]
*  Long Island, just so you know, is massive. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=6.2s)]
*  It's got millions of people. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=7.92s)]
*  And in New York City, there's The New York Times, The New York Post, The New York Daily [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=11.08s)]
*  News, all based in the city, all these things we think of as New York papers. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=16.56s)]
*  But out on Long Island, where there are millions of people, forever, it's been New York Newsday. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=19.92s)]
*  New York Newsday is a big paper, a big circulation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=26.46s)]
*  It is indisputably the paper of record, and it has been there forever. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=30.74s)]
*  And I actually mean that literally. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=35.7s)]
*  Local laws all over the country require the publication of public notices in the paper, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=38.86s)]
*  in the paper of record. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=43.46s)]
*  So this is notices about upcoming public hearings, about proposed laws, real estate transactions, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  stuff like that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=50.14s)]
*  We don't really have classified ads the way we used to in newspapers, but there's still [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=51.14s)]
*  a bunch of fine print notices in major papers. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=54.96s)]
*  And those are often public notices that are required by law in the local paper of record. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  And those public notices are a considerable source of income for local newspapers. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=65.64s)]
*  So on Long Island, in Nassau County, Long Island, the county government there is headed [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=71.44s)]
*  up by an elected county executive. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=77.38s)]
*  And in Nassau County, the county executive is a Trump guy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=80.8s)]
*  So much so that, perhaps feeling a little jealous that Trump has his oath keepers and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=85.6s)]
*  his proud boys, pro-Trump paramilitary militias, this county executive on Long Island has also [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=90.68s)]
*  formed his own semi-official paramilitary force of military and law enforcement veterans [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=97.14s)]
*  that he says he wants to be able to call up on his own orders to supplement official law [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=103.72s)]
*  enforcement. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=108.8s)]
*  Yeah, if that puts a little shiver in your quiver, it's because you're paying attention. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=110.8s)]
*  But that same very Trumpy county official in Long Island, New York, has now yanked all [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=117.28s)]
*  public notices from Newsday, from the paper of record in Long Island, and instead has [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=124.44s)]
*  started putting public notices instead in a right-wing New York City tabloid that's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=131.2s)]
*  not even based in Long Island. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=137.72s)]
*  Newsday is suing to get the public notices back, but we'll see. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=148.12s)]
*  Here's a second story. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=150.12s)]
*  This is the second part of the same story. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=152.52s)]
*  You might have also seen headlines recently about Trump's new FCC chair going after NPR [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  and PBS. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  Now I recognize you might have skipped past those headlines because they look familiar. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  Every time a Republican's in the White House, they always say they're going to go after [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=170.88s)]
*  NPR and PBS. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=172.76s)]
*  And every time, Americans rise up and say, you know, leave Big Bird alone and leave NPR [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  alone. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  We freaking use it and we like it and go mess with something else. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  This time, though, did you see how exactly they're going after them? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=184.6s)]
*  They've decided to go out a different way this time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=191.16s)]
*  They've opened an investigation into how NPR and PBS stations state on the air who [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=193.4s)]
*  their underwriters are. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=199.8s)]
*  NPR and PBS are public broadcasting, so they don't accept ads per se, but they do accept [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=201.4s)]
*  sponsorships. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=209.0s)]
*  And when you're watching something on PBS or listening to something on NPR, you will [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  hear them tell you who their sponsors are. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=214.0s)]
*  It's part of how NPR and PBS stations stay financially viable and sustainable and, honestly, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=216.12s)]
*  locally grounded in their local communities because a lot of their underwriting is from [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=221.52s)]
*  local businesses. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you've ever listened or watched public media, you know this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=228.48s)]
*  They do pledge drives to raise money from people who join as members. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=231.76s)]
*  They also get local organizations and local businesses to sponsor their programs. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=235.0s)]
*  So you get like, you know, this hour of jazz and classical music brought to you by your [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=238.76s)]
*  local Ford dealer or whatever. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=242.6s)]
*  But that is what they're going after them for this time. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=246.83999999999997s)]
*  They're saying that their underwriting is somehow wrong. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=250.72s)]
*  The way they stake the names of their underwriters, that's illegal somehow. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=254.36s)]
*  And this is a new approach. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=259.8s)]
*  This is not the usual blunt force Republican attack of threatening to take away their federal [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=261.8s)]
*  funding. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=265.8s)]
*  Federal funding only makes up a fraction of the budgets of NPR and PBS. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=266.8s)]
*  Now, they're doing it differently this time. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=270.2s)]
*  They're actually going at the way these stations are sustainably and locally making [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=272.52000000000004s)]
*  money to keep their programs on the air. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=279.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=281.72s)]
*  Because actually that funding is more important to NPR and PBS stations than federal funding [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  is. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  And so, yeah, go at the thing that makes them their most money. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=290.24s)]
*  Go at the thing that actually makes them viable. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=292.76000000000005s)]
*  I mean, if these guys can stop the thing that makes these stations actually most of their [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=294.64000000000004s)]
*  money, that is a better way to cripple the high quality gold standard independent U.S. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=300.04s)]
*  journalism and programming of NPR and PBS. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  That's a better way to do it than just threatening to cut off the fraction of their funds that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  come technically from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and taxpayer money. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=311.68s)]
*  So that's another. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=318.12s)]
*  You might also have seen headlines about the move at the Defense Department to take away [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  office space used at the Pentagon by correspondents from the New York Times and NBC News and other [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=324.08s)]
*  major news organizations. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=329.56s)]
*  Now, it does not mean that these news outlets are banned from covering the Pentagon. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=330.56s)]
*  It just means they can't cover the Pentagon as well as they do now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=336.32s)]
*  I mean, they'll be allowed to attend briefings and get emails or whatever, make phone calls. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=340.91999999999996s)]
*  But they are no longer allowed to be based there at the Pentagon so they can be there [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  all around the clock while decisions are being made and things are happening. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  They can't do that anymore. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=354.2s)]
*  That office space has been there for Pentagon correspondents for decades. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=355.84s)]
*  But in the Trump administration, they're pulling it from well-established, competent, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=360.64s)]
*  independent news organizations that they don't like and that they would like to hurt. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=364.6s)]
*  All of these stories are the same story. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=373.56s)]
*  This is not just your typical political thing where you've got somebody in the White House [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  or somebody in politics complaining about press coverage. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=380.68s)]
*  It's not even the typical thing with Trump calling the press the enemy of the people [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=383.16s)]
*  or whatever Stalinist thing he's onto now. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=386.92s)]
*  This is what they call the Viktor Orban playbook for using the power of government to eliminate [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  independent credible professional journalism, using the power of government to hurt journalism [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  as much as possible, to weaken it as much as possible, to try to drive independent, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=401.36s)]
*  capable professional media out of business and into ruin so that it goes away. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=406.04s)]
*  And the only thing that's left is, for lack of a better term, state TV. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=412.42s)]
*  In September, a few weeks before the election, the publisher of The New York Times wrote [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=419.72s)]
*  a long op-ed and in a sort of gesture of solidarity, I think, he published it not in his own paper [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=423.96s)]
*  but in The Washington Post. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=430.64s)]
*  So it's The Times publisher publishing something in The Washington Post. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  And it was a really important piece. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=436.64s)]
*  It was about what he thinks, at least, we should have been expecting if an authoritarian-minded [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=437.76s)]
*  Donald Trump returned to the White House and was determined to do to the press what [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=446.52s)]
*  he had been promising to do to the press through his first term. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=451.79999999999995s)]
*  The warning, basically, was that Trump would probably try to do something to the press [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=455.79999999999995s)]
*  in this country along the same lines of what Viktor Orban did to the press in his country, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=459.64s)]
*  in Hungary, when he destroyed the free press there as part of his takeover as a de facto dictator. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=464.84s)]
*  It said this, quote, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=471.64s)]
*  other weakened news outlets at cut rates to turn them into government mouthpieces. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=501.64s)]
*  Within a few years, only pockets of independence remain in the country's news media, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=507.08s)]
*  freeing the leader from perhaps the most challenging obstacle to his increasingly authoritarian rule. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  Instead, the nightly news and broadsheet headlines unskeptically parrot his claims, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=517.08s)]
*  often unmoored from the truth, flattering his accomplishments while demonizing and [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=521.72s)]
*  discrediting his critics. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=526.28s)]
*  Quote, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=528.0400000000001s)]
*  This is the short version of how Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=538.52s)]
*  effectively dismantled the news media in his country. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=541.96s)]
*  This effort was a central pillar of Orban's broader project to remake his country as an [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=545.08s)]
*  illiberal democracy. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=549.64s)]
*  A weakened press made it easier for him to keep secrets, to rewrite reality, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=551.4000000000001s)]
*  to undermine political rivals, to act with impunity, and ultimately to consolidate unchecked [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=555.64s)]
*  power in ways that left the nation and its people worse off. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=560.84s)]
*  It's a story that is being repeated in eroding democracies all around the world. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=565.4s)]
*  And it is a story that is being aped right now by the second Donald Trump presidential term. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=571.0s)]
*  And this is not yet being treated as one of the things the new Trump administration is doing, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=579.8s)]
*  but they are doing it. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=584.36s)]
*  And they are using both the federal government and allies outside government to do it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=585.64s)]
*  And if the model holds, I expect that what we're going to see is a big spike in defamation cases [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=590.6s)]
*  brought against various media companies, particularly now that so many companies are [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=597.88s)]
*  settling them and paying rather than fighting them. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=602.04s)]
*  We will see a systematic litigation effort, I believe, to undo libel law in this country, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=604.76s)]
*  the decades-old precedent called New York Times v. Sullivan. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=610.92s)]
*  The goal of undoing that precedent will be to make it easier for truly ruinous lawsuits to be [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=614.4399999999999s)]
*  brought against news organizations, whether or not they're brought in good faith. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=620.1999999999999s)]
*  If they can succeed in restructuring defamation and libel law in this country, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=626.12s)]
*  which they are trying to do, it will result in a restructured legal environment where [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=629.9599999999999s)]
*  news organizations really can't win. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=633.9599999999999s)]
*  And yeah, you can have the government come after them, but you can also have [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=636.28s)]
*  the president's allies in private life come after them in ways that are designed to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=639.72s)]
*  financially weaken, cripple, and ultimately shut down or cause to be sold, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=644.0400000000001s)]
*  the oppositional independent media in this country. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=649.32s)]
*  We have a free oppositional, independent, aggressive, often annoying and pushy press [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=654.36s)]
*  in this country, which you may not always like. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=660.28s)]
*  But it is how we learn what the government is doing. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=663.64s)]
*  And it's the main reason why the government has to answer questions about what they're doing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=667.5600000000001s)]
*  Support for professional, independent, and even oppositional media has never been more important. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=673.16s)]
*  We are seeing a wall-to-wall strategy start to gear up to try to blow up the press [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=679.16s)]
*  and effectively just have state TV from here on out. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=685.88s)]
*  It is a concerted effort. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i29JtdyhO4s&t=688.76s)]
