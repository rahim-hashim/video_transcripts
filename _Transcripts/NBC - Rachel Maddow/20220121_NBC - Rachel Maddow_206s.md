Video Description: Daniel Goldman, former assistant U.S. attorney, talks with Rachel Maddow about the diversity of evidence the January 6th Committee has collected in its investigation and how revealing evidence related to Ivanka Trump's activities on January 6th makes her relevance to the investigation obvious to the public and makes any resistance she might put up to testifying to the investigation harder to justify.

# January 6 Committee Uses Evidence To Paint Ivanka Trump Into A Corner On Testifying
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ)
*  Joining us now is Daniel Goldman. He's a former assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  He also served as the Democrats majority counsel during Donald Trump's first impeachment trial [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=3.92s)]
*  Mr. Goldman, thank you for being here. There's a lot going on. I was really hoping we could get to talk to you tonight [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=9.4s)]
*  Yeah, amazing the amazing Newsday on the legal front. It really is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  So, let me ask you first about the Ivanka Trump letter today and what the January 6th investigators told us in that letter [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=20.84s)]
*  About their investigation. I just wanted to ask you there was a lot of revelation [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  There were a lot of revelations in that letter to me today in terms of stuff that I didn't know they knew [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=33.24s)]
*  Quotes from from transcripts [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Descriptions of things that we had never had described to us before [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=42.2s)]
*  What stood out to you is the most significant thing about that? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, I think some of what it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=49.44s)]
*  Stands out to me really is the types of evidence that they have [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=52.56s)]
*  The fact that Keith Kellogg who I [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=57.08s)]
*  Remember refused to testify in the first impeachment [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=61.16s)]
*  Investigation that I was running he came in and testified and he gave a sort of minute-by-minute [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=65.28s)]
*  Clearly gave from the the document a minute-by-minute [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=72.24s)]
*  Exposition of what happened that he saw on January 6 including [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=75.92s)]
*  Conversations that Donald Trump was having we now know that Kayleigh McEnany who? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=81.12s)]
*  testified last week the former press secretary [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=87.36s)]
*  Provided text messages to the committee [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=90.28s)]
*  So we're starting to see that the committee is actually getting a lot of evidence [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=93.44s)]
*  Notwithstanding some of the obfuscation and obstruction from the Meadows and the Bannon's etc that they're still [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=99.52s)]
*  Gathering and able to gather a lot of evidence and it was interesting to me Rachel. It's an 11 page letter and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  Obviously the committee did not need to include all of this evidence for a request to Ivanka Trump [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=115.5s)]
*  But I noted a couple things that I thought were really interesting legally first [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  They're really narrowing their requests to January 6th and in light of that Supreme Court decision that you referenced yesterday [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=126.7s)]
*  Which relies on the Court of Appeals decision earlier? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=133.62s)]
*  Where basically courts have said that it doesn't matter whether Donald Trump is the former president or would be president now [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  But matters that occurred on January 6th are not subject to executive privilege [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=144.62s)]
*  that's basically everything that they ask Ivanka Trump for and then the other thing that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=149.78s)]
*  That jumps out to me is they're putting Ivanka Trump in a really difficult position by laying out all of this evidence [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=155.7s)]
*  Now we know what evidence they have and we know how relevant and important her testimony is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  so if she is going to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=169.10000000000002s)]
*  Refuse to testify based on you know some fictional reason [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=172.02s)]
*  She looks a lot worse because it's very clear that she's an important witness. So strategically I thought it was a very [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  interesting and smart move by the committee [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=183.38s)]
*  You [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXEwkSkrjrQ&t=192.02s)]
