Video Description: Rachel Maddow looks at the small and steadily dwindling crowds showing up at Donald Trump's various legal appointments to show their support and object to Trump being subjected to legal accountability. Despite Trump's best efforts at all-caps rallying cries on social media, supporters outside his New York criminal trial have been few and far between.

# Trump fails to attract courthouse protest despite all-caps pleas for support
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0)
*  So, January 22, there's speculation that he is facing potential criminal charges. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=0.0s)]
*  So, he says, in January 22, quote, I hope we are going to have in this country the biggest [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=5.88s)]
*  protests we have ever had. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=10.84s)]
*  Then, a few months later, that fall, he said, if he was indicted, the United States would [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=13.72s)]
*  face, quote, problems the likes of which perhaps we've never seen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=19.56s)]
*  Then, March 2023, he's indeed preparing to be indicted in New York, and he just sounds [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=24.92s)]
*  the clarion call. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  This is it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  All capital letters. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=32.24s)]
*  He says, quote, protests take our nation back. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=33.24s)]
*  It's time. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  We just can't allow this anymore. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=37.6s)]
*  We must save America. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  Protests, protests, protests. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=41.44s)]
*  He says it three times with three exclamation points. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=42.84s)]
*  When Trump was indeed then indicted, when he was indeed then arraigned, these were all [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=46.8s)]
*  the people who came out to protest, protest, protest in favor of him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=51.46s)]
*  This was the biggest crowd he's had from any of these things. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=56.3s)]
*  This was it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=59.22s)]
*  Probably not enough to take the country back, certainly not with three exclamation points. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=60.22s)]
*  But that was the biggest he ever got. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=65.26s)]
*  Two months later, another indictment, this time in the classified documents case in Florida. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=67.58s)]
*  Again, he demanded that his supporters rally for him in person. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=71.86s)]
*  Quote, all caps. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=76.26s)]
*  See you in Miami on Tuesday. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=77.66s)]
*  Local law enforcement prepared for crowd prepared for crowds of up to 50,000 people after he [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=79.9s)]
*  said that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=84.58000000000001s)]
*  The actual crowd was closer to 500 people, not 50,000 people. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=86.5s)]
*  Then last week, ahead of opening statements in his New York criminal trial, Trump tried [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=92.26s)]
*  cranking the handle again. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=96.86000000000001s)]
*  Seventy two hours until all hell breaks loose. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=98.42s)]
*  If we fail to have a massive outpouring of peaceful patriotic support right here, right [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=101.14000000000001s)]
*  now, all hell will break loose. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  All hell did not break loose. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  It was Rudy Giuliani's adult son and a smattering of other people. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=108.54s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=114.02000000000001s)]
*  Trump has actually tried claiming that big throngs of people have been showing up to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=116.74000000000001s)]
*  protest and show their support for him in New York, or at least that people have showed [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  up trying to protest. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  But he says police have been keeping them away. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=128.1s)]
*  He's tried claiming on social media that the area outside the court was, quote, completely [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=131.3s)]
*  closed down. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=135.58s)]
*  He said, quote, thousands of people were turned away from the courthouse in lower Manhattan [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=137.54s)]
*  by steel stanchions and police. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=141.22s)]
*  And again, that's just not true. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  People are not the police are not turning people away. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=147.94s)]
*  There are no steel stanchions that are blocking his supporters from turning up and walking [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  around them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=156.14s)]
*  I mean, you can you can walk right up there. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=157.14s)]
*  But by by Thursday, the third day of testimony in the trial this past week, it was just this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  one dude named Gary. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=165.66s)]
*  And that was kind of it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=167.66s)]
*  And so because he has not just been predicting protests on his behalf, he has been commanding [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=170.54s)]
*  his followers to protest for him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=175.54s)]
*  It is a little humiliating for Trump that this is happening, that he can't seem to summon [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=179.66s)]
*  a crowd. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=185.58s)]
*  It's also just an interesting data point, broadly speaking, as to whether or not Trump [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=186.58s)]
*  can command an angry mob at this point in his political trajectory, or are those days [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=189.5s)]
*  behind him? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  I think the other way that this functions, though, is that it's an important reminder [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  that he's not getting what he wants in terms of daily stimulation, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=200.34s)]
*  He's not getting crowds of people lining the streets or standing outside the courtroom [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=204.82s)]
*  chanting for him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=208.66s)]
*  Nobody's out there for him. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=210.74s)]
*  The courtroom where his trial is taking place is old and dingy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  It kind of smells weird. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=216.86s)]
*  And so starting tomorrow, he's heading into another week of long, detailed testimony. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=218.98s)]
*  We can expect that he will be disappointed, angry, and perhaps delusional about the reasons [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=225.1s)]
*  that there are not people outside protesting for him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=229.66s)]
*  Inside the trial, if passed as prologue, he's likely to be bored and unhappy while not receiving [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=232.78s)]
*  the kind of response and adoration from the people he expects to deliver that to him. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=238.14s)]
*  Maggie Haberman at the New York Times recently put it this way. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=244.06s)]
*  She said, quote, It is hard to recall any other time Trump has been forced to be bored [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=247.22s)]
*  for so long. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=252.82s)]
*  Quote, The shared sense among many of his advisers is that the process may damage him [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=254.06s)]
*  as much as a guilty verdict. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=258.94s)]
*  The process, they believe, is its own punishment. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=260.38s)]
*  If the process is the punishment here, what should we expect from what these next few [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=264.86s)]
*  days are likely to be like, with likely no more protesters and testimony that we can [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=269.26s)]
*  sort of see coming around the corner that seems like it might be more boring than anything [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=274.82s)]
*  that's yet happened? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=278.86s)]
*  How much worse is this about to get for him, and can he pull the ripcord to get out of it? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4kibyMv6p0&t=281.14s)]
