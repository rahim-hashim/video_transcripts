Video Description: The Florida Republican Party has demonstrated an important function of democratic institutions in stripping the party chair, Christian Ziegler, of power when Ziegler refused to resign after a rape accusation and the revelation of a three-person sexual tryst put him at odds with the values the party thought he represented. Rachel Maddow explains why institutional self-policing matters in a democracy.

# Sex scandal, rape accusation drive Florida GOP to strip chair's power in model of self-policing
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA)
*  We do not get to point out Florida very often as an example of how our small-D democratic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=0.0s)]
*  institutions are supposed to work. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=6.22s)]
*  Florida, a place where things are being done right. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=8.34s)]
*  That happens very rarely. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=11.68s)]
*  But bear with me here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  I swear that's where this is going. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Here goes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=16.38s)]
*  For the past few weeks, the Florida Republican Party has been trying to figure out what to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=17.38s)]
*  do about its state Republican Party chairman. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=20.64s)]
*  He has been accused of sexual assault, of rape. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=23.56s)]
*  And beyond the alleged criminality and the details of the allegation against him are [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=28.3s)]
*  harrowing, a search warrant in the case shows that the background of this case is a prior [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=32.38s)]
*  sexual relationship between the accuser, a woman, the Florida Republican Party chairman, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=39.86s)]
*  a man, and also his wife. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=45.660000000000004s)]
*  The three of them together in a thing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  The aforementioned wife of the Republican Party chairman is a founder of the anti-gay [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=52.660000000000004s)]
*  book banning group Moms for Liberty. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=56.8s)]
*  She says she personally helped write the Florida Don't Say Gay Law, despite what was apparently [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  going on in her own... [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=65.28s)]
*  Yeah, anyway. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=66.28s)]
*  The combination of the sort of hypocrisy at this epic level and the electoral politics [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=70.64s)]
*  here and the alleged crime here is a lot, even by Florida standards. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=75.4s)]
*  And the chairman of the state Republican Party is still maintaining his innocence. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=81.84s)]
*  Yesterday, the executive board of the Florida Republican Party took action against him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=86.36s)]
*  They voted to strip him of his authority as state party chair. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=91.0s)]
*  They reduced his salary to one dollar. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=94.64s)]
*  They censured him and they told him to resign. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=96.94s)]
*  And in one sense, you can make of this what you want, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=101.04s)]
*  Whether Florida Republicans are taking action because their chairman's wife appears to have [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=103.04s)]
*  been both against and also into the gay at the same time, whether they're repelled by [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  the specific allegations, whether they're just trying to make the scandal go away so [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=113.48s)]
*  it doesn't cost them in the upcoming elections, whatever. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=117.0s)]
*  The point here is that the example the Florida Republicans are setting, political parties, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=121.04s)]
*  turns out, are not inert bystanders that have no power when it comes to deciding who gets [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=128.28s)]
*  to be in charge in politics and specifically in their party. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=133.38s)]
*  Political parties can police themselves. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=137.6s)]
*  People who fight back against censure, they can still be censured. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=141.68s)]
*  They can have their salary reduced to a dollar. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=146.56s)]
*  All of their power can be taken away. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  Political parties are institutions that can play an important role in policing bad behavior [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=151.34s)]
*  by political actors. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  This is how institutions in our small-D democracy are supposed to work. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=158.88s)]
*  If you want them to. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0QY2sASoA&t=162.96s)]
