# GOP Leaders Mortified By Colleagues Supporting Trump Insurrection: New NYT Audio
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik)
*  Tonight, New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns have released more [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=0.0s)]
*  audio from the immediate aftermath of the January 6th attack. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=4.04s)]
*  Their forthcoming book, which is released on Tuesday of next week, is apparently going [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=7.86s)]
*  to be accompanied by an absolute trove of incredibly disturbing audio tapes, audio recordings [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=11.68s)]
*  of Republicans speaking among themselves in the immediate aftermath of the January 6th [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=19.68s)]
*  attack, including this newly released discussion of how dangerous top Republicans believed [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=25.12s)]
*  it was for pro-Trump Republican members of Congress to keep talking in violent terms [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=30.76s)]
*  to violent and incendiary terms about even other members of Congress the way they were [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=36.2s)]
*  in the wake of the January 6th attack. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  That gate said where he's calling people's names out saying an anti-Trump in this type [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=55.12s)]
*  of atmosphere and some of the other places, this is serious stuff people are doing that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=60.48s)]
*  has to stop. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=67.4s)]
*  I'll make individual calls. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=68.4s)]
*  I think Moe and Louie's comments too, a lot of members have said some real concerning [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=69.4s)]
*  things about... [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=77.28s)]
*  Did they say something today too? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=78.28s)]
*  No, I said Louie was at... [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=80.28s)]
*  I mean Moe was at the rally, you know, the we're kicking a **** and taking names thing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=82.28s)]
*  at the Trump rally. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=87.04s)]
*  These are things... [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=88.04s)]
*  These are things before they kicked that out. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=89.04s)]
*  Okay, this is... [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=90.04s)]
*  Okay, what did Gates say? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=91.04s)]
*  Gates said... [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=92.04s)]
*  Gates brought up Liz specifically. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=93.04s)]
*  I just saw that on Twitter. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=94.04s)]
*  Adam, someone just sent it to me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=95.04s)]
*  Gonzalez just sent it to me. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=96.04s)]
*  So I'm calling Gates. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=97.04s)]
*  I'm explaining to him. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=98.04s)]
*  I don't know how to say it, but I'm going to have some other people call him too. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=99.04s)]
*  But I'm going to have to call him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=100.04s)]
*  I'm going to have to call him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=101.04s)]
*  I'm going to have to call him. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=102.04s)]
*  I'm going to have to call him. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=103.04s)]
*  I'm going to have to call him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=104.04s)]
*  I don't know how to say it, but I'm going to have some other people call him too. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  But the nature of what... [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  If I'm getting briefing, I'm going to get another one from the FBI tomorrow. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  This is serious ****. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  Cut this out. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's... [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  That's... [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's potentially illegal. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, he's putting people in jeopardy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  And he doesn't need to be doing this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  We saw what people would do in the Capitol. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=129.8s)]
*  You know. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=132.8s)]
*  At least he became prepared with rope, with everything else. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=134.56s)]
*  We saw what people would do in the Capitol. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=140.56s)]
*  They came prepared with rope, with everything else. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=142.56s)]
*  Just before that, we heard Louisiana Republican Congressman Steve Scalise saying about Matt [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=146.56s)]
*  Gates, yeah, that's potentially illegal, what he's doing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=151.56s)]
*  McCarthy said, well, he's putting people in jeopardy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=155.56s)]
*  He doesn't need to be doing this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=157.56s)]
*  We saw what people would do in the Capitol. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=159.56s)]
*  He became prepared with rope, with everything else. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=162.32s)]
*  That audio just released tonight by the New York Times. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=166.32s)]
*  That's the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives talking about their own [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=168.32s)]
*  members, how their incendiary calls to violence, even against other members of Congress, were [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=172.32s)]
*  potentially illegal, very concerning, threatening to the point of Mr. McCarthy referencing the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=178.32s)]
*  FBI briefings that he was getting in that same discussion. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=185.32s)]
*  In addition to that recording tonight released by the New York Times, we've also now got [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  the context for what Nicholas Burns and Jonathan Martin had reported here on this show last [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  week when they described Kevin McCarthy expressing exasperation that social media companies, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  that Twitter wasn't cutting off the accounts of more Republicans beyond just Trump. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  As Republicans continue to use social media platforms like Twitter to call for violence [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  or to otherwise say things online that could incite it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=217.84s)]
*  Here's that tape. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=220.84s)]
*  It was something like that, yes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=247.84s)]
*  You got the Maxine waters and all that stuff too. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  So I mean, I know the Dems are in a very strong position right now to drive a lot of things, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  but our members have got to start paying attention to what they say too and you can't put up [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  with that type of s***. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  Brooks apparently said today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  s***, which I would say is even a step further than rhetorical take. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  If you think the President deserves to be impeached for his comments, that's almost [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  how it goes for the President. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  Alright, let's see if someone can give me the info on what they said. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=300.59999999999997s)]
*  Have either of them apologized for what they've done? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=306.59999999999997s)]
*  I have not seen that anywhere. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  And there's an issue with Alabama. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  Barry Moore has said some things today even that we should look at, honestly. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  What did Barry say today? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=324.59999999999997s)]
*  Alright, so he deleted his personal Twitter account, but Jamie Dupree with the Atlanta [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  Journal got screen shot. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=333.36s)]
*  He said about 22 hours ago, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=336.36s)]
*  And then [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=354.36s)]
*  Moore also made this tweet on Saturday night as the US Capitol police officer who shot [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=357.12s)]
*  and killed a woman as he tried to get into the lobby. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=362.12s)]
*  So he tweeted at Marjorie Green and at Ney Rall. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=365.12s)]
*  I understand it was the black police officers that shot the white female veterans. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=368.12s)]
*  You know that doesn't fit the narrative. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=372.12s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=378.12s)]
*  This is what we have to confront with this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=382.12s)]
*  Can't they take their Twitter accounts away too? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=387.12s)]
*  Can't they take their Twitter accounts away too? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=391.12s)]
*  It was a black police officer who shot the white female, says Congressman Barry Moore. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=395.12s)]
*  A gasp then follows on the call and then you hear Kevin McCarthy say, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=400.12s)]
*  Can't they take their Twitter accounts away too? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=404.12s)]
*  You heard earlier in that tape of that conversation, this is a tape that reportedly was made on [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=408.12s)]
*  four days after the attack on the Capitol. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=413.88s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy appearing to say about Congressman Mo Brooks, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=415.88s)]
*  You think the president deserves to be impeached for his comments ahead of the attack on the Capitol, January 6th. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=420.88s)]
*  Then describing what Congressman Mo Brooks had said at the same rally where the president spoke before the attack. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=427.88s)]
*  He said, quote, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=434.88s)]
*  That's something that goes further than what the president says. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=436.64s)]
*  So they're talking about Mo Brooks being even more culpable than President Trump [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=439.64s)]
*  and President Trump deserving impeachment for what he had said. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=443.64s)]
*  And then this quote from another Alabama Congressman Barry Moore [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=446.64s)]
*  talking about the fact that it was a black police officer who shot a white female. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=453.64s)]
*  Gasp. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=458.64s)]
*  Can't they take their Twitter accounts away? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=459.64s)]
*  After those recordings were published tonight, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=462.4s)]
*  further illustrating how keenly Republicans in leadership were aware [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=467.4s)]
*  that what their own members were doing was going to cause violence. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=471.4s)]
*  . [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS2wv--A8Ik&t=491.64s)]
