# Midterms See Democrats Pit Practical, Small-Ball Politics Against GOP Demagoguing Racism
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI)
*  Here's the headline in The Washington Post this weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=0.0s)]
*  Racist GOP appeals heat up in final weeks before the midterms. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=2.4s)]
*  Quote, as the campaign heats up in the final weeks before November's midterm elections, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=7.28s)]
*  so have overt appeals to racial animus and resentment. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  And the toxic remarks appear to be receiving less pushback from Republicans than in past years, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=14.72s)]
*  suggesting that some candidates in the first post-Trump election cycle [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=19.36s)]
*  have been influenced by the ex-president's norm-breaking example. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=22.72s)]
*  Quote, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, which works to counter anti-Semitism, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=27.04s)]
*  said, it is not new to see anti-Semitism or overt racism in politics. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=31.36s)]
*  What is new is after years in which it was clear that to be credible in public life, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=35.52s)]
*  politicians had to reject prejudice. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=39.84s)]
*  It has now been normalized in ways that are really quite breathtaking. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=43.2s)]
*  He says, quote, I don't know if it will be very easy to put the genie back in the bottle. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=47.92s)]
*  So, I mean, we're three weeks out from election day, and that's the message coming from one side, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  right, which history is screaming at us about in terms of how dangerous this stuff is. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  But to win elections, you can't just point at it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  You can't just point at anything and say, no, not that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=67.76s)]
*  Right, there has to be another message. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=70.56s)]
*  There has to be a competing message in this case about why we should stay with police [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  in this case, about why we should stay with political solutions to our problems. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=78.72s)]
*  We shouldn't blame some mythical other for ruining everything, which requires us to burn [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=83.76s)]
*  it all down and maybe abandon democracy and certainly abandon election results. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=88.72s)]
*  Right, there's a case to be made not just against what they're advocating, but also why we should [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=93.68s)]
*  keep the democratic system we have had for more than 200 years in this country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  And so there's just this incredibly stark contrast for this election. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=103.2s)]
*  Right, on the right, it's all these things we've been talking about, including [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=106.88s)]
*  blatant anti-Semitic appeals from the highest profile people on the conservative side of the aisle, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=110.8s)]
*  and no negative response to that from Republicans at large. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=117.36s)]
*  And from the Democratic Party, on the other side, we've got like the most purely practical stuff. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=123.12s)]
*  It's literally, you know, hearing aids. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=129.84s)]
*  As of today, you can get hearing aids over the counter, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=132.88s)]
*  which means they will be thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars cheaper. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=135.68s)]
*  The NIH estimates that more than 80 percent of Americans who could benefit from hearing aids [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=139.84s)]
*  don't use them in large part because they're really hard to get. They're super expensive, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  and most insurance plans don't cover them, so you have to pay cash. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=148.0s)]
*  Starting today, you can just buy hearing aids over the counter, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  which makes it way easier and should bring the cost of hearing aids down by thousands of dollars, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=155.52s)]
*  which should mean that millions of Americans who need help with hearing loss, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=161.36s)]
*  whose lives would be seriously improved by having assistance with hearing loss problems, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=166.8s)]
*  their lives are going to get better. That's brand new as of today. There was a vote five [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=175.84s)]
*  years ago in 2017 that made it possible for the FDA to do this and to allow hearing aids to be [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  over the counter. The Trump administration just sat on it for years, and it didn't get done. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  President Biden decided he was going to make it a priority. He signed an executive order in August, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=189.84s)]
*  giving the FDA 120 days to get it done, and they got it done. And now, as of today, life will be [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=193.76s)]
*  materially improved, both financially and in terms of quality of life, literally for millions of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=199.76s)]
*  Americans who have hearing loss. If you don't have it now, you very well may get it later. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=205.28s)]
*  This could benefit something like 30 million people, and that's very practical. You might [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=211.04s)]
*  see that as kind of small ball politics, but that's the kind of thing that Democrats are [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=218.56s)]
*  putting on the table ahead of this election in three weeks. I mean, look at the highest profile [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=221.84s)]
*  actions that President Biden and the Democrats have taken in the lead up to this election. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=228.16s)]
*  President Biden and Democrats passed legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=232.8s)]
*  to literally put a cap on the amount that seniors can pay out of pocket for prescriptions. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=237.28s)]
*  Republican senators have now introduced their plan to repeal it, to make you pay more for [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=241.84s)]
*  prescriptions, especially you seniors. Okay. President Biden came up with a plan to reduce [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=247.12s)]
*  people's student loan debt, again, for millions and millions and millions of Americans, a hugely [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=253.12s)]
*  practical financial improvement in your lives. Republican states are suing to try to get rid of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=259.6s)]
*  that, to make you pay more for your student loans. President Biden recently pardoned people with [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=265.52s)]
*  convictions for possession of marijuana. I don't think Republicans have come up with a way to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  challenge that yet, but they're just completely silent on it. They won't talk about it. They're [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=276.24s)]
*  pretending it's not happening. And this kind of stuff, these kinds of initiatives from the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=280.24s)]
*  Democrats, these are implicitly an argument for democracy, right? I mean, you see where I'm going [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=286.24s)]
*  with this. The way you argue for democracy is not just by pointing the figure at people who want [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=293.36s)]
*  violence or fascism and saying, whoa, that's bad. That always works out badly. I mean, you have to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  do that, but you also need to make the positive case that democracy is a good idea, that democracy [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=302.0s)]
*  can deliver meaningful, practical improvements in Americans' lives. So I think that's why this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=306.8s)]
*  election season feels so weird. There's this mismatch from the two sides, right? Republicans [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=314.56s)]
*  going apocalyptic, you know, end times, end of democracy, huge proportion of Republican voters, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=321.6s)]
*  let alone Republican candidates, Republican voters saying unless their team wins, they will not [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=327.84s)]
*  accept the election results as legitimate because election results no longer are the way Republicans [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=332.64s)]
*  want to do things in this country. Meanwhile, we've got simultaneously these overt anti-Semitic [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=337.76s)]
*  appeals from the highest profile people on their side of the aisle. That's what's happening on the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=342.88s)]
*  right. While Democrats are like, hey, we not only like democracy, we are using our democratic system [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=347.12s)]
*  to do practical things that hopefully help you and your family. And Republicans don't want those [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=353.44s)]
*  practical things to work, but that's the argument from the Democrats. Now, how is this playing out [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=360.24s)]
*  in individual races so far? I believe it is still hard to tell. In Georgia, early voting started [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=367.2s)]
*  today. In Georgia, the Republican candidate in that marquee Senate race there, Herschel Walker, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=374.4s)]
*  was just asked about the cap on drug prices, including a cap on the price of insulin, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=378.88s)]
*  which is a life or death necessity for people with diabetes. He responded by suggesting that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=384.16s)]
*  people really might not need the insulin if they would just eat right. They don't really need the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=388.8s)]
*  insulin. How's that going to play in Georgia? One party capping the price of insulin so that you [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=393.36s)]
*  don't break the bank, paying for a drug that you need to stay alive. The other party saying, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=401.2s)]
*  do you really need that? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmb8x7-7viI&t=405.04s)]
