# Why Trump could end up in jail if he can't keep his cool about being indicted
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4)
*  Joining us now is David Rode. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=0.0s)]
*  He's executive editor for News at the NewYorker.com. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=1.4000000000000001s)]
*  He's the author of the book, In Deep, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=3.94s)]
*  which details the lengths that Bill Barr went to protect [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=5.88s)]
*  Donald Trump at the US Justice Department, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=9.16s)]
*  which ultimately in some ways is what got us here today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  David, it's nice to see you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=15.52s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=16.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=17.62s)]
*  Do you think it is fair to see this indictment today [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  as the sort of fruit that was grown on the tree [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=25.26s)]
*  that was Bill Barr? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=32.06s)]
*  When Bill Barr came in basically to try to protect Trump [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=33.900000000000006s)]
*  at the US Justice Department, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=37.74s)]
*  did that effectively set in motion the chain of events [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=39.660000000000004s)]
*  and the timeline that led to this indictment today? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=42.86s)]
*  It did, and it's partly this crazy theory [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=45.660000000000004s)]
*  that sitting presidents cannot be indicted. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=49.5s)]
*  This Office of Legal Counsel opinion [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=52.14s)]
*  in the Justice Department that came up so many times [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=54.46s)]
*  in the Mueller investigation, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=57.18s)]
*  it came up again in the Cohen case. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=58.26s)]
*  And if we had a more functional Congress, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=60.1s)]
*  that would be, I think, a reform [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=65.1s)]
*  that would maybe help our democracy, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=66.82s)]
*  that presidents aren't immune from prosecution [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=69.16s)]
*  or investigation in all forms by the Justice Department [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=72.86s)]
*  while they're in office. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  But now we are here today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=77.14s)]
*  Was Trump, clearly in that, in the court papers [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=79.18s)]
*  when Cohen pled guilty, Trump was individual [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=81.66s)]
*  and one, can Alvin Bragg convince a Manhattan jury [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=85.22s)]
*  that that was true beyond a reasonable doubt? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=88.98s)]
*  And you mentioned the threats [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=91.86s)]
*  and we can talk about that more, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=93.26s)]
*  but that is the concern here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  A critical player in this trial is gonna be the judge. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=95.82000000000001s)]
*  And how do you give Donald Trump a fair trial? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=99.42s)]
*  I completely agreed with what was said earlier by Andrew. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  Let's calm down. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=107.26s)]
*  Let's let the system work. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=108.58000000000001s)]
*  If Donald Trump is acquitted, that's fine. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=109.9s)]
*  That's the way our system works. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=113.08s)]
*  But I'm very concerned about how can a judge [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=114.76s)]
*  make this a fair trial without making it a crazy trial [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=118.56s)]
*  where jurors feel intimidated. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=122.2s)]
*  Well, David, I know you spoke with prosecutors [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=124.92s)]
*  who have handled cases against Trump allies, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=127.24s)]
*  particularly Trump allies who are sort of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=131.16s)]
*  cut from the same cloth as he is, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=132.56s)]
*  like people like Roger Stone. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=134.96s)]
*  What did they tell you? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=137.04s)]
*  What do you think we can extrapolate [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=138.98s)]
*  from those earlier cases [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=140.36s)]
*  in terms of how this one might go? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=142.52s)]
*  So when Trump is arraigned, he will be released on bail. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's normal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  That's for any, I think, nonviolent crime. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=148.44s)]
*  But there's a series of conditions he then agrees to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=151.28s)]
*  with the judge so that he can be out on bail [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=154.56s)]
*  and so he can participate in the trial. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=156.88s)]
*  He's got to obey what the judge tells him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=159.0s)]
*  And what happened in the Roger Stone trial, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=161.66000000000003s)]
*  this is the sort of famous dirty trickster and Trump ally [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  back to the Richard Nixon era. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=167.84s)]
*  At one point during Roger Stone's trial, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=170.61999999999998s)]
*  he posted a picture of the judge in his case [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=172.7s)]
*  and there was a crosshairs, like a target beside her face. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=176.06s)]
*  She then, and it's her right as a judge [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=180.78s)]
*  and judges can do this with the defendant, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=182.94s)]
*  she issued a partial gag order that barred Roger Stone [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=184.38s)]
*  from posting anything online regarding that trial. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=189.26s)]
*  You can imagine what would happen if Donald Trump, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=193.5s)]
*  if a judge in the upcoming trial [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=196.17999999999998s)]
*  were to limit his ability to speak online [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  and the most extreme step that a judge could take, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  and this is the issue here, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=204.98s)]
*  if he is intimidating jurors with threats of violence, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=206.7s)]
*  they can revoke his bail. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  So that's why the judge is such a critical player in this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=212.98s)]
*  Frankly, it's in Donald Trump's interest to stay calm [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=216.38s)]
*  and to act calmly and sanely [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=219.45999999999998s)]
*  and say I'm not afraid of this trial. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=222.14s)]
*  I trust this system, I trust jurors, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=224.42s)]
*  but he certainly doesn't have a history of that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyatMYQ5lA4&t=226.86s)]
