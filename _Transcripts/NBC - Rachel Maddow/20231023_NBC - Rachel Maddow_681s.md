# 'Negotiations large and small': Hostage releases, aid to Gaza suggest possible shift as war rages
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY)
*  I want to start tonight with what feels like it might be an important new stage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=0.0s)]
*  in the war between Israel and Hamas. Now, we don't want to overstate things. I want to be clear that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=5.04s)]
*  the, you know, the big picture remains the same. Israel, in response to the terrorist attack by [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=10.72s)]
*  Hamas that killed more than a thousand Israeli civilians, has continued its airstrikes inside [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=16.56s)]
*  the densely populated Gaza Strip. While there's been so much expectation as to whether Israel [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=22.0s)]
*  is going to launch a ground invasion and when they're going to do that, in the meantime, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=27.6s)]
*  they have launched these devastating airstrikes day after day after day. More than 4,000 people [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=31.28s)]
*  in Gaza are believed to have been killed since the Israeli retaliation for the Hamas terrorist [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  attacks began 17 days ago. Civilians cannot leave Gaza still, even including the U.S. citizens who [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=42.800000000000004s)]
*  are among the civilians there. But the first trickle of aid has been allowed in. A small convoy [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=53.04s)]
*  of aid trucks was allowed in on Saturday and then another convoy was allowed in on Sunday and then [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=60.64s)]
*  another small convoy was allowed in today. And that is good. That is not enough, but that is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=66.56s)]
*  something. The aid that has come in thus far does not involve fuel. And while fuel might not seem [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=74.24s)]
*  like the most important thing to supply when you're talking about humanitarian aid, the U.N. is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=82.16s)]
*  raising urgent concerns about the remaining hospitals inside Gaza and whether they can keep [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=86.56s)]
*  their generators running, to keep electricity on inside the hospitals, to keep things like ventilators [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=91.92s)]
*  running and life support machines for people who are previously ill and also for newborn babies. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=96.96s)]
*  The U.S. military has moved considerable resources and personnel to the region. There are ongoing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=103.36s)]
*  worries about the conflict potentially broadening to include other countries and other armed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=108.72s)]
*  militias in the region. The U.S. embassies both in Iraq and in Lebanon have sent out new warnings [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=112.64s)]
*  about the safety of U.S. citizens and U.S. diplomatic staff and their families. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=118.64s)]
*  So, I mean, all that to say the biggest of big pictures here remains as precarious as ever, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=123.84s)]
*  but there is a tiny little bit of hope on one piece of it tonight. We saw two hostages who had [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=127.84s)]
*  been taken by Hamas, an Israeli American mother and daughter, get released on Friday. Tonight, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=132.4s)]
*  two more hostages have been released. This is two frail elderly Israeli women, both in their 80s, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=137.6s)]
*  both of whom have been held by Hamas for more than two weeks. The two of them were released tonight. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=144.56s)]
*  There had been some reports today about the potential release of a much larger group of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  hostages, maybe four dozen or more hostages potentially set to be released in some sort of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=154.88s)]
*  arrangement, but NBC has not been able to confirm independently any of those reports. They remain [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=162.0s)]
*  just a glimmer for people who are trying to maintain hope here. So far, only four hostages [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=167.92s)]
*  have been released. Joining us now is NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  live from Jerusalem. Richard, thank you so much for being here. I know it's the middle of the night, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  four in the morning there. I really appreciate you. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=182.32s)]
*  It's always the middle of the night with you, Rachel. No matter where you go in the country, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=187.2s)]
*  it's always the middle of the night and it's always talking about something grim. But, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=190.64s)]
*  yes, how are you? It's true. I'm okay, Richard. It's always, it's true. We need to come up with [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=194.48s)]
*  some other beat that you and I cover together and at better times. But Richard, let me ask you about [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  this, the hostage situation. Obviously, everybody's overjoyed to see two hostages released on Friday, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  to see two more released today. There was some reporting today, which NBC has not independently [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=213.68s)]
*  confirmed that maybe we should expect additional hostage releases in larger numbers. What's your [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=219.36s)]
*  understanding of that and what do we know about these older women who are released today? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  So what we're trying to do is to track these negotiations in real time through the negotiators. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  But obviously, the negotiators are working with Hamas, working with the Israeli authorities. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=239.12s)]
*  Primarily, we're talking about Egyptian and Qatari negotiators. And it is a very, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=245.76s)]
*  very difficult process to follow because obviously, for security reasons, they don't want to give away [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=250.88s)]
*  too much. But they are actively trying to trade things. The Hamas wants certain things. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=256.32s)]
*  It wants the sort of more access for humanitarian supplies into the Gaza Strip. It wants some of its [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=264.32s)]
*  prisoners to be released. It wants to engage in a kind of resumption of a peace process, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=270.72s)]
*  to have a path towards statehood. We're hearing more and more from Hamas about its specific demands. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=277.36s)]
*  I spoke to a senior Hamas leader tonight about these specific issues. And there is hope that [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=283.04s)]
*  there will be more. And during the day today, I was one of those people who thought, OK, there's [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=289.04s)]
*  going to be more. There's these rumors, reports of a potentially larger group that could have come [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=295.76s)]
*  out today. But these negotiations don't always go well. And even when these two Israeli women were [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=302.0s)]
*  eventually released, Hamas released them, but sort of issued a complaint saying, we're releasing them, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=310.48s)]
*  even though Israel violated the terms of our agreement eight times. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=317.52s)]
*  And there had been, although we didn't notice it, a mini ceasefire, a pause for a few hours [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=324.08s)]
*  today, according to Hamas, and another pause, it said, was six hours long in the airstrikes on [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  Friday. So they're negotiating things big and small. Sometimes it's just a pause for a few hours, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=337.36s)]
*  or much larger issues about opening access to the Gaza Strip, potentially prisoner swaps, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  potentially more than that. So this could take some time. And every time that there is hope, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=349.76s)]
*  there is a lot of chance that things could go wrong, that there's another airstrike [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=357.12s)]
*  changed in complications. Communications are difficult because this senior Hamas leader told [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=362.48s)]
*  me tonight the hostages are held in different places. Communication from one place to the other [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=368.32s)]
*  is difficult so that they're facing some logistical challenges just to gather these people [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=374.72s)]
*  and try and free them if they want. Now, that could be Hamas coming up with excuses. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  But you said, is it a glimmer of hope? Yes, at least there's some movement, at least they're not [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  executing these hostages in a one-every-hour or anything like that. There does seem to be some [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=394.24s)]
*  progress. There are lines of communication to Hamas, and there are efforts ongoing by [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=400.08s)]
*  friendly nations to try and secure the release of these people. Richard, it strikes me as a pretty [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=408.0s)]
*  incredible thing in its own right that you've been in touch with senior Hamas officials about [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=414.64s)]
*  this issue. Do they explain or do they put it to you in any way that you can convey to us [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=419.52s)]
*  why they took these hostages and if they planned from the outset that they would hold these [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  hostages in order to try to extract concessions or ceasefires or any other of the things that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=432.32s)]
*  they're asking for now as just the first four of them had been let go? It almost feels from some [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=439.2s)]
*  of the reporting that I've seen about the hostage-taking that Hamas didn't necessarily [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  know what they were going to do with these civilian hostages when they got them, let alone [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=450.47999999999996s)]
*  in these large numbers more than 200 of them. Did they give you any sense, any clarity on [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=453.92s)]
*  what their intention was or what their intentions are in the long run with these people? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=459.68s)]
*  My interpretation and some of this is just by my analysis of having covered this for a long time, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=467.44s)]
*  covered the Middle East, covered Hamas for many years, I think they bit off more than they could [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=472.88s)]
*  chew and that what we're seeing in Gaza is a result of Hamas not realizing how far it was [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=477.84s)]
*  going to get, how devastating its attack would be, how many people they would take. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=485.44s)]
*  The group has also hinted at that. There was one statement from their chief military spokesman, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=491.67999999999995s)]
*  Abu Ubaidah, who said that they swept up all these foreign nationals by accident because as [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=497.28s)]
*  people were being dragged over the border, they didn't have a chance, this is according to them, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=504.32s)]
*  to verify their identities and they ended up with too many non-Israelis. So even they acknowledge [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=508.64s)]
*  that it was a chaotic time and that they ended up with more people than they wanted. Now on the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  other question, what do they want to do with them? They clearly intended to take people. They clearly [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=522.8s)]
*  went in to kill people and capture people but probably not this many and probably not this [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=528.0s)]
*  many foreign nationals bringing the entire world against them. What they want is they want [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=534.08s)]
*  concessions. Every time they've taken people in the past, they have been able to secure the release [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=540.48s)]
*  of prisoners. Many of the top Hamas leaders themselves, the inner circle of Hamas who are [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=547.44s)]
*  running the group now, were themselves prisoners in Israeli jails who were swapped when other [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=552.8s)]
*  members of Hamas grabbed an Israeli soldier and then demanded, and then part of that, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=561.52s)]
*  part of their demands was a prisoner release. So they, the top leadership themselves, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=567.3599999999999s)]
*  know this process from personal experience. It secured their own release. So I think at the end, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=572.56s)]
*  as we get closer and more and more hostages come out, and hopefully that will happen, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=579.68s)]
*  hopefully that will happen soon and in larger numbers, I think we're going to start hearing [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=585.28s)]
*  not just demands about more access for humanitarian aid into Gaza and more access [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=589.92s)]
*  to for fuel and other things, but we'll start, they'll start asking for the, more specifically, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=594.8s)]
*  for the demands of prisoners. And they've already said that as well. One of the Hamas leaders I was [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=600.2399999999999s)]
*  talking to said in order to release the soldiers, they make a distinction between the civilians and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=605.36s)]
*  the soldiers. Although here in Israel with Hamas, it's quite difficult because a lot of Israelis, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=612.4s)]
*  until they're quite old, can potentially be reservists in this country. So who gets [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=618.48s)]
*  considered a soldier is a little bit up to Hamas's interpretation. But they have said for the soldiers, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=623.36s)]
*  not specifying exactly what they, who they consider a soldier, if you're active duty, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=630.24s)]
*  non-active duty, serving in uniform, out of uniform, et cetera, they said they want the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=634.64s)]
*  release of all Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. And there are thousands of them. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=639.1999999999999s)]
*  Wow. Richard Engel, Chief Foreign Correspondent for NBC News. This has been a day of real ups [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=645.12s)]
*  and downs specifically on this issue of the Israeli hostages. Thanks for keeping us up to date and [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=650.9599999999999s)]
*  keeping us honest on this, Richard. I appreciate it, my friend. Sure thing. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBDUWsZ8ZPY&t=656.24s)]
