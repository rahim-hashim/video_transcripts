# Legislators blasted by constituents at town halls over Musk's wanton federal destruction
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts)
*  We're also seeing more people show up at town halls to question their members of Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=0.0s)]
*  Last night, we showed you part of a town hall that was held in Roswell, Georgia by Republican [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=5.36s)]
*  Congressman Rich McCormick. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=8.8s)]
*  I want you to see a little bit more from that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=10.3s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=12.48s)]
*  We have workers from the nuclear workers, the NSA, our nuclear stockpile, and CDC workers [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=13.48s)]
*  working on the bird flu being fired by Doge and then having to be rehired when someone [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=23.28s)]
*  realizes, oh gosh, we need those people. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  Why is the supposedly conservative party taking such a radical and extremist and sloppy approach [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  to this? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  You have to do more with less in order to survive. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Trying to do more with less. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  That's reasonable. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  What's not reasonable is taking this chainsaw approach, which they obviously admit when [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  they fired these people and they decided, oh, we fired the wrong people. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=54.4s)]
*  We got to bring them back in. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=58.08s)]
*  Why is this being jammed down the pipe so rushed and sloppily? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=59.08s)]
*  So crowd goes wild. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=64.08s)]
*  So that was Roswell, Georgia last night. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=69.08s)]
*  This was a teletown hall, telephone town hall. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=71.08s)]
*  Also last night, this was Republican Congresswoman Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=74.08s)]
*  I'm a registered Republican voter, retired active army officer. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=81.08s)]
*  How can you tell me that Doge with some college quiz kids from a computer terminal in Washington, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=84.08s)]
*  D.C., without even getting out into the field after about a week or maybe two has determined [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=92.08s)]
*  that it's okay to cut veterans' benefits? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=99.08s)]
*  I think a couple things. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=104.08s)]
*  Let me give you an example. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=106.08s)]
*  Did you know that the VA was in charge of payments for illegals for housing? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=107.08s)]
*  Basically, the VA... [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=117.08s)]
*  No, I'd like for you to send me that reference so I could research that because no, I'm not aware of that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=119.08s)]
*  And I would tell you that that's a red herring, a false flag. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=125.08s)]
*  If you're throwing that kind of political stuff up, trying to cut veterans' benefits, that's very alarming to me. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  Registered Republican voter, retired active army officer. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=135.08s)]
*  That is the kind of reaction these members are facing even from Republican voters in Republican districts. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=140.08s)]
*  This was the scene in West Bend, Wisconsin with Republican Congressman Scott Fitzgerald. Watch. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=146.08s)]
*  When will you stand up to them and say that is enough? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=152.08s)]
*  The end result of the fraud and abuse that has been discovered already... [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=164.08s)]
*  There's absolutely no proof. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=175.08s)]
*  That is a congressman coming to terms with his constituents. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=179.08s)]
*  West Bend, Wisconsin. About an hour away in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, another Republican Congressman, Glenn Grothman, also getting an earful. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=183.08s)]
*  President Trump has issued a lot of executive orders. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=191.08s)]
*  I think by and large this is moving very quickly compared to other administrations and I think across the board. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=195.08s)]
*  He's done some very good things. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=202.08s)]
*  I think he's gotten rid of birthright citizenship. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=204.08s)]
*  Illegal as hell. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=220.08s)]
*  That's illegal as hell. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=223.08s)]
*  We are seeing this kind of thing all across the country and it is interesting. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=226.08s)]
*  It is Republicans having to face this from their constituents. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=229.08s)]
*  But you're also seeing Democrats who are largely of one mind with their constituents, but they are getting pushed to fight harder. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=233.08s)]
*  Congressman Paul Tonko is a Democrat from New York. He represents the area around Albany, New York. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=242.08s)]
*  This week Congressman Tonko held a town hall. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=246.08s)]
*  You might have seen this clip going around, but if you haven't seen it, you will want to watch this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=249.08s)]
*  I saw you on TV at NOAA. I saw you on TV at the Department of Education. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=255.08s)]
*  What I'm saying is this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  Somebody asked you what your red line was and you said that the time is always right to go. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  Does that mean the red line has already been crossed? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  Because I think it has. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  I think it has. If you ask us to show up, Congressman Tonko, we will show up. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=273.08s)]
*  But it could not be. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=278.08s)]
*  We have to take the gloves off. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=284.08s)]
*  We can't lift the vertical. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=286.08s)]
*  They're not playing by the rules. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=288.08s)]
*  We have to take it to them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=290.08s)]
*  When I saw you at those places, when I saw you at the Maxine Waters, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=295.08s)]
*  I was so proud that my representative was on the front line right there. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=301.08s)]
*  But I thought about Jimmy Carter and I thought about John Lewis. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=306.08s)]
*  And I know what John Lewis would have done. He would have gotten arrested that day. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=312.08s)]
*  Make them outlaw you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=317.08s)]
*  We will stand with you. We will be there with you. I will get arrested with you. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=322.08s)]
*  The crowd goes wild. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu1nW1pygts&t=331.08s)]
