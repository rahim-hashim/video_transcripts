# What ever happened to the federal investigation of Trump's fake elector scheme?
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM)
*  We have seen, as you pointed out multiple times now, various different false slate of electors [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=0.0s)]
*  from seven different states in what seems to be a coordinated effort between the Republican [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=6.16s)]
*  parties in various different states. We think this is a matter that is best investigated [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=12.4s)]
*  and potentially prosecuted by the feds. And, as such, just today, we referred this matter [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=17.84s)]
*  to the Western District, the U.S. attorney's office, for them to evaluate it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=23.52s)]
*  That was Michigan's Attorney General Dana Nessel speaking on this show back in January 2022, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=30.72s)]
*  wondering why Republicans in multiple states had sent in fake electoral votes from fake [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=37.2s)]
*  presidential electors as though Donald Trump had won their states when he had not. They clearly [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  hoped that when Vice President Pence went to certify the results of the election on January 6th, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=48.72s)]
*  he would use their fake votes from the fake electors for Trump instead of the real ones [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=54.0s)]
*  for Biden, and in so doing, he would make Donald Trump president. Well, the Michigan Attorney [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=59.84s)]
*  General told us that night in January 2022, so a year after the January 6th attack on the Capitol, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=65.36s)]
*  she told us that this matter of the fake electors she believed was best investigated and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  potentially prosecuted at the federal level. She told us that night that she had referred this [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=77.68s)]
*  matter to the U.S. Justice Department, January 13th, 2022. January 13th, 2022. That was a long [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=82.08s)]
*  time ago now. Whatever happened to that? We covered this story intensively at the time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  We had the documents. We had the fake slates of electors because the Republicans who were involved [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=99.2s)]
*  in this scheme actually sent them in to the National Archives, which is where real electoral [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=105.2s)]
*  votes are supposed to be sent. You can see here the real elector documents. You can see every [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=110.8s)]
*  state does them a little differently. They all come up with some variety of certificate. They [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  all have their own quirks, their own fancy or not fancy paper, decorations and seals. This is what [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=121.36s)]
*  the real ones look like. Look at the forged Republican documents instead. They do not look [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=126.96s)]
*  quite so fancy. In fact, they match. Same formatting, same font, same spacing, and as you see here, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=131.76s)]
*  almost the exact same wording on every single one. Because of the similarities, the obvious [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=138.48s)]
*  similarities between all these forged documents from all of these different states, it just really [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=146.0s)]
*  did not seem like this Republicans in all these different states all independently had the same [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=151.2s)]
*  idea that they were all going to try to commit this kind of fraud all in the same font. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  If that was happening independently in all of these states, they all would have sent in documents [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  that looked somewhat different, or at least that sort of matched what the proper format was supposed [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=168.0s)]
*  to look like in their state. Instead, they all matched from all the different states. It really [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=173.28s)]
*  did appear to be some kind of coordinated effort. Somebody telling all of these Republicans in all [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=177.68s)]
*  of these different states, here's what you're going to do. Put your name here. The fake elector [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=182.88s)]
*  scheme, apparently a centrally organized scheme operating through multiple states, it is now part [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=189.84s)]
*  of at least three criminal investigations that we know of. One brought by a prosecutor in Georgia, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=195.76s)]
*  Fonny Willis. Another on the federal level out of the U.S. Department of Justice under special [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=201.12s)]
*  counsel Jack Smith. And also in Michigan. The Michigan attorney general announced earlier this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  year that she was taking back this case and reopening it in Michigan since the DOJ hadn't [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=212.0s)]
*  yet acted on her referral to them a year earlier. What we've now learned today is confirmation that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=217.12s)]
*  at least the federal investigation took a really, really, really long time to get going on this [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  matter. And in the Washington Post today, we learned some of the reasons why. The Washington [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=231.68s)]
*  Post has a kind of blockbuster report today, it's like 8,000 words, describing in detail what's been [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=236.4s)]
*  going on inside DOJ since January 6th as fears of seeming partisan or seeming overly aggressive [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=243.28s)]
*  essentially stalled big portions of the Justice Department investigation into Trump for more than [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=250.96s)]
*  a year. The Post says today that the Justice Department was alerted to the fake elector scheme [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=256.72s)]
*  right after it happened in early 2021. Quote, officials at the National Archives had discovered [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=262.48s)]
*  similarities and fraudulent slates of electors for Trump that his Republican allies had submitted [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=267.6s)]
*  to Congress and the Archives. The National Archives Inspector General's Office asked DOJ's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=272.24s)]
*  Election Crimes Branch to consider investigating the seemingly coordinated effort in swing states. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=276.8s)]
*  According to two people familiar with the decision, the Justice Department declined [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=284.56s)]
*  that investigation suggested to them by the Inspector General's Office at NARA. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=290.0s)]
*  They declined to investigating it, citing its prosecutor's discretion. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=294.48s)]
*  DOJ had instead decided that they were going to start with the small fry, they were going to work [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=299.2s)]
*  their way up to the bigger fish. They were going to arrest and prosecute individual rioters from [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  January 6th and not worry so much about the people who had orchestrated the riot and everything else [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  as part of a way of overthrowing the US government. So in early 2021, DOJ declined to investigate the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=317.12s)]
*  fake electors and instead focused on the people who physically personally attacked the Capitol. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=324.8s)]
*  That was 2020. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=332.8s)]
*  In January 2, well, the national press has started to pick up the story. Dana Nessel [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=335.84s)]
*  announces live on our air that she wants the Justice Department to investigate this. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=341.76s)]
*  The January 6th investigation in Congress starts very publicly looking into the fake [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=346.32s)]
*  elector plot themselves. Well, now, thanks to this new reporting today in The Washington [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=351.44s)]
*  Post, we know that those things combined finally got the Justice Department interested in the fake [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=356.0s)]
*  electors again. Quote, one person directly familiar with the department's new interest in the case [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=362.0s)]
*  said it felt as though the department was reacting to the House Committee's work, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=367.76s)]
*  as well as heightened media coverage and commentary. Only after they were embarrassed [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=371.6s)]
*  did they start looking, the person said. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=376.96s)]
*  The process did not go quickly. Lawyers at the FBI and Justice Department launched into what became [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=379.84s)]
*  many weeks of debate over the justification for the investigation and how it should be worded. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=384.96s)]
*  One time consuming issue became whether to name Trump as a subject. Finally, as public pressure [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=390.56s)]
*  mounted, quote, in April 2022, more than 15 months after the attack, FBI Director Christopher Wray [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=397.52s)]
*  signed off on the authorization, opening a criminal investigation into the fake electors plot. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=404.96s)]
*  It has been a year and a half since we began talking about the fake elector scheme on this [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=412.08s)]
*  show, almost two and a half years since the Justice Department was first advised to start [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  looking into it. Still no federal charges, but now we at least have an idea of why it's been [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  taking so long to reach this point. Thanks to this great reporting from The Washington [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=429.12s)]
*  Post today. We posted a link to the story at Mado blog tonight. I commend it to you. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=434.4s)]
*  It is worth reading for yourself. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXamIvsN2PM&t=439.52s)]
