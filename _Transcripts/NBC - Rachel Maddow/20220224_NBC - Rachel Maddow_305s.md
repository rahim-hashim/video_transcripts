# Ukrainian Citizens Prepare To Fight Russian Forces As Explosions Continue In Kyiv
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8)
*  The Pentagon says Russia has fired more than 160 missiles into Ukraine since this invasion [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=0.0s)]
*  started. And they do say at least some of them have been targeted around Ukraine's capital [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=5.24s)]
*  city. Russia keeps saying it's only targeting military targets, but at least one of the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=9.64s)]
*  missiles shot into Kiev hit a residential part of that city today. Tonight, that assault [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=13.44s)]
*  apparently continues. Erin McLaughlin is an NBC News correspondent who's in Kiev right [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=18.32s)]
*  now. She just told us that they have started to hear loud booms in the capital city again. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  It is about 3 45 in the morning there right now and joining us now live from Kiev is Erin [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=27.48s)]
*  McLaughlin. Erin, thank you. We know there's currently a curfew in place. We know it's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=32.04s)]
*  just coming up on four in the morning. But what can you tell us about what you're seeing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=36.2s)]
*  and hearing right now? Hey, Rachel. Well, within the last hour or so, we've heard the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=39.4s)]
*  sounds of two explosions in the distance to my right. At this point, the source of those [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=46.16s)]
*  explosions is unknown. Otherwise, there is an eerie calm that has set in here on the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=52.04s)]
*  capital. You mentioned the curfew that's in place until seven in the morning. As I'm looking [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  around, not a single person on the city streets yesterday was total chaos here. There was [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=63.32s)]
*  explosion after explosion after explosion. The sounds of sirens as people ran for cover [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=70.64s)]
*  inside the city's metro stations, thousands trying to flee. There were long lines of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=77.04s)]
*  traffic gas stations running out of gas, long lines at ATM machines. Although some people [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=82.28s)]
*  are choosing to stay and to fight the Russians. I was outside the National Police headquarters [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  here in the capital watching as lines of people were gathering to collect guns. They were [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=95.04s)]
*  handing out AK-47s from the federal government. Yesterday, I was speaking to a local member [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=102.72s)]
*  of parliament. He was there to get two AK-47s, one for him, one for his wife. They were hunkering [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=108.36s)]
*  down in the suburbs. He told me that he was worried that he's concerned, that he's stressed, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=114.0s)]
*  that he doesn't know how to shoot a gun, that he was going to go home and Google it, figure [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=120.6s)]
*  out how it worked, but that he was prepared to protect his country. And that's something [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=124.88s)]
*  over and over and over here from Ukrainians that I've been speaking to this as we are [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=129.68s)]
*  expecting the Russians. They are encroaching here on Kiev and people here certainly are [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=134.32s)]
*  preparing for the worst, worse than really what we've already seen so far. Mostly the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=139.56s)]
*  missile strikes that have happened here in the capital, in the capital area have targeted [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=145.3s)]
*  military installations and airfields. Rachel? Is the Ukrainian government being explicit [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=150.32s)]
*  about, I mean, we saw the calls today for people to, for everybody, every able citizen [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=156.24s)]
*  to sign up for territorial defense. And we saw the calls from the government, you know, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=163.24s)]
*  bring your passport. If you are a Ukrainian citizen and you want to fight to defend your [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  country, we will arm you to do so. Are they being explicit that what they're thinking [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  about, I mean, you're talking to that member of parliament and went and picked up an AK-47 [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=176.8s)]
*  for himself and his wife. Are they being explicit that they're expecting Russian troops in the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=180.12s)]
*  streets and they're expecting urban street fighting, people defending their homes from [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=184.52s)]
*  a ground invasion that will be an occupying force? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=190.52s)]
*  You know, Rachel, I don't think they need to be. People here know what's happening. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=196.4s)]
*  They know what's at stake. Just a few weeks ago, I was at a sort of private training camp, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  so to speak, in the suburbs of Kiev, hundreds of people showing up on their Saturday morning [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=206.36s)]
*  in the freezing cold to learn how to fire a weapon, to learn how to evacuate the wounded, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=211.96s)]
*  to learn how to administer first aid. And standing in formation was a 73-year-old man, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=215.92s)]
*  and I asked him, what will you do if the Russians invade your city? What will you do if the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=221.84s)]
*  Russians invade your country? And he looked at me squarely and he said, I will shoot. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=227.16s)]
*  I will shoot them. People here know what is at stake here and they know what is at risk. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=231.2s)]
*  There was a local pizza parlor here in Kiev and the owner of that parlor was handing out [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=237.68s)]
*  free pizzas to anyone who would show, had some sort of proof that they had bought a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=242.96s)]
*  weapon. And he was saying that he, in his mind, given that he had been on the front [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=249.0s)]
*  lines in 2014, that it was only a matter of when, not if, this invasion took place. So [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=253.36s)]
*  people here, you know, have been preparing, some have been preparing for some time, Rachel. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=260.8s)]
*  NBC News correspondent, Erin McLaughlin, reporting live from Kiev just ahead of 4 a.m. there. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=266.44s)]
*  Erin, thank you. Thank you for your reporting since this has started and thank you for getting [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=271.32s)]
*  absolutely zero sleep to be with us here tonight. I really appreciate it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQMfoVRg-F8&t=276.71999999999997s)]
