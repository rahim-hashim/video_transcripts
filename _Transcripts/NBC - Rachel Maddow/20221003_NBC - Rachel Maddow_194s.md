# New Maddow Podcast Finds Contemporary Resonance In 1940s Sedition Trial
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w)
*  Around the same time that Laura Ingalls was coming under investigation for being a paid Nazi agent in the late 30s, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=0.0s)]
*  her husband, Charles Ingalls, was also implicated in a nationwide plot involving hundreds of armed 13-man cells [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=7.0s)]
*  who were all going to violently attack government targets around the country simultaneously. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=16.0s)]
*  He and his co-conspirators expected that FDR was going to win re-election in 1940, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=22.0s)]
*  but they thought Americans on the far right would be upset by that outcome. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=27.0s)]
*  So in order to channel that upset into something much more dangerous, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=31.0s)]
*  they planned that in the aftermath of FDR winning election, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=35.0s)]
*  they would mount hundreds of simultaneous armed attacks on U.S. government targets in states all across the country, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=38.0s)]
*  all at the same time, thus setting off chaos and panic in the United States, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=45.0s)]
*  galvanizing and radicalizing anti-Roosevelt Americans, culminating in a violent takeover of the United States government [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=49.0s)]
*  and the installation of something much more like a fascist dictatorship. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=56.0s)]
*  Good times. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=61.0s)]
*  A week from today, next Monday, I am launching a new podcast. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=65.0s)]
*  It's called Rachel Maddow Presents Ultra, and it's about this time that I'm talking about in American history, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=69.0s)]
*  this last big round of fights that we had as an American people against our fellow Americans on the ultra-right [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=75.0s)]
*  who wanted to violently overthrow the government, who decided they were done with elections [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=84.0s)]
*  and done with democratic governance in this country, and they were willing to act by any means necessary to get that done, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=89.0s)]
*  including, in the case of some of these folks, taking support from the Hitler government in Germany to aid in their cause. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=94.0s)]
*  So the podcast is called Ultra because it's about our experience in this country with the ultra-right, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=103.0s)]
*  but most of the storyline is actually about sedition, about a huge sedition trial that was mounted against more than two dozen defendants in 1944. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=108.0s)]
*  It's about why that trial was sort of impossible, and it's about how members of Congress, who themselves were involved in these shenanigans, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=118.0s)]
*  who themselves were implicated in what was going on, members of Congress used their political power in Washington [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=126.0s)]
*  to intimidate the Justice Department and drive the prosecution off course. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=131.0s)]
*  Anyway, the trailer is out today. Podcast launches next week. I will say more about it next week on the show. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=136.0s)]
*  And I knew when I said about working on this last year that there was contemporary resonance to this story about American authoritarianism [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=141.0s)]
*  and trying to overthrow the government by force January 6th, putting people on trial for sedition. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=151.0s)]
*  I knew there would be resonance for what we are going through now. That's why I wanted to do it in the first place. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=156.0s)]
*  I did not know at the time that I picked this topic and this launch date for the podcast that the actual sedition trial for January 6th [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=161.0s)]
*  would be starting on the day the podcast was announced. But that is what happened today. Here we are. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCZndzar6w&t=168.0s)]
