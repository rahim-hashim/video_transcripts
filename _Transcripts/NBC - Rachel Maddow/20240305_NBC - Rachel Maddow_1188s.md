# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 4
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo)
*  Here is the serving Republican Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina on that movie, on Black Panther. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=0.0s)]
*  He says it is, quote, created by an agnostic Jew and put to film by a Satanic Marxist. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=8.0s)]
*  He calls it, quote, this trash that was only created to pull the shekels out of your schwarze pockets. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=16.0s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=25.0s)]
*  Tomorrow on Super Tuesday, he's actually going to be running in the North Carolina primary to try to become his party's nominee for governor of the great state of North Carolina. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=29.0s)]
*  Here he is calling survivors of school gun massacres, quote, media prostitutes, as in prostitutes, but prostitutes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=38.0s)]
*  He calls them spoiled little bastards who need to shut up. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=49.0s)]
*  Again, this is for kids who lived through a school shooting that killed 17 of their classmates. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=53.0s)]
*  They need to shut up. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=59.0s)]
*  He calls public school teachers, quote, wicked people. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=61.0s)]
*  And not for nothing, he says this about the Holocaust. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=65.0s)]
*  He says, quote, Hitler disarming millions of Jews and then marching them off to concentration camps is a bunch of hogwash. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=68.0s)]
*  He is the Republican Party's leading candidate to be their party's nominee for governor of the state of North Carolina. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=77.0s)]
*  He will be on the ballot tomorrow in that state. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=85.0s)]
*  He's already Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=88.0s)]
*  On Friday in Florida, Republicans in that state legislature passed yet another new law to restrict any teaching about racism in the United States. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=91.0s)]
*  This happened just this past Friday, just a couple days ago in Florida. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=103.0s)]
*  And in the debate over this new Florida bill, one Republican Florida state representative said that while this bill overall will restrict teaching about racism and things like slavery in Florida, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=107.0s)]
*  he said there is one specific thing that he wanted to make sure is included in public education in Florida from here on out. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=119.0s)]
*  He said while he supports this bill, he does want to make sure everybody's aware that slaves were, quote, paid for their work. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=126.0s)]
*  And so he wants to make sure that's taught in schools. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=135.0s)]
*  And then he voted for the bill. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=139.0s)]
*  This, of course, comes in Florida after the state's Republican governor tried to claim during his presidential campaign that there were actually a lot of underappreciated benefits of slavery for the people who were enslaved. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=141.0s)]
*  The chair of the Florida Democratic Party put out a statement in response, clearly just mystified, saying, quote, Florida Republicans are hell bent on teaching our children that slavery wasn't bad. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=152.0s)]
*  And it is hard to argue. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=165.0s)]
*  I know it's insane, but it keeps happening. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=169.0s)]
*  Pop over to Oklahoma. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=173.0s)]
*  In Oklahoma, Republicans control the state government there, too. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=175.0s)]
*  And like just about everywhere, that's that's true. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=178.0s)]
*  Oklahoma Republicans have now banned abortion in almost every circumstance. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=182.0s)]
*  But that apparently is not enough for them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=186.0s)]
*  Oklahoma Republicans are now moving a new bill that would create a state registry of every woman who does still find a way to get an abortion. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=188.0s)]
*  I wonder what Oklahoma Republicans will want to do with a state database of women who have undergone abortions. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=198.0s)]
*  I'm sure they want it for only the most respectful and responsible reasons. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=206.0s)]
*  Other lawmakers are warning that the way the Oklahoma bill is written looks like it's also in addition to creating a registry of women who have had abortions. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=212.0s)]
*  It also seems intended to ban contraception, including forms of contraception like the IUD. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=221.0s)]
*  That's what Oklahoma Republicans are up to. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=228.0s)]
*  In Alabama, you may remember the nine Republican justices on the Alabama Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling that effectively outlawed fertility treatment in that state. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=232.0s)]
*  After Alabama's Supreme Court, Republicans did that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=242.0s)]
*  Democrats in Congress in Washington introduced federal legislation to protect fertility treatment and protect IVF. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=246.0s)]
*  That legislation was blocked by Republican U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=252.0s)]
*  There are 219 Republicans in Congress right now in the House. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=259.0s)]
*  Of that 219 number of Republicans, 125 of them are co-sponsors of legislation that would ban IVF. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=263.0s)]
*  And arguably many popular forms of contraception as well. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=273.0s)]
*  125 House Republicans, more than half the Republicans in the House, co-sponsored that, including the Republican Speaker of the House. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=277.0s)]
*  125 of them. 195 of them voted against contraception. Full stop. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=287.0s)]
*  The Right to Contraception Act was introduced by Democrats after the Republican appointees on the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=292.0s)]
*  The right to contraception. Only eight Republicans in Congress voted for that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=300.0s)]
*  195 voted against. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=306.0s)]
*  And let's just stick with health care just for a second. Florida again. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=310.0s)]
*  Florida, they are now contending with a super worrying outbreak of measles. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=313.0s)]
*  Measles like it's the 1800s or something. One of the most transmissible pathogens on Earth. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=317.0s)]
*  And one we don't typically have to worry about anymore in this country because for 60 fricking years we've had a totally effective vaccine against measles. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=323.0s)]
*  Except in Florida, Republicans picked a very special state surgeon general who's now telling Florida parents, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=331.0s)]
*  Oh, who am I to suggest that perhaps kids should be vaccinated against measles? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=338.0s)]
*  Yesterday, the Florida Department of Health released a letter from Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Lattopo emphasizing how contagious measles is, but did not urge parents to vaccinate their children. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=342.0s)]
*  He does not, which is an interesting letter from a surgeon general. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=357.0s)]
*  Beyond who am I to say your kids should be vaccinated, the handpicked hand Republican picked Florida Surgeon General wouldn't even say that kids with measles should stay home from school. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=362.0s)]
*  While they're infectious and symptomatic with one of the most transmissible potentially fatal pathogens known to mankind. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=375.0s)]
*  Measles in Florida. Not to be outdone. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=382.0s)]
*  Now the Republican Party's leading presidential candidate is saying on the stump that he will withhold funding, withhold all funding, not a penny from any school anywhere in America if kids have to be vaccinated to come to school. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=386.0s)]
*  Kids have to be vaccinated all over the country everywhere against measles and mumps and polio. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=398.0s)]
*  I mean, it's been it's been true for decades. It's been true for generations. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=407.0s)]
*  But just in case you've been missing, I don't know, iron lungs, the Republican Party is raring to go this election year with a new measles and polio for all the kids plan. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=411.0s)]
*  And what you know, what swing state busy mom and dad isn't going to want to get the whole family to lick that doorknob and vote GOP this November with that kind of platform on offer to the American people. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=421.0s)]
*  Can we get a smallpox over here? How about some tetanus for the little ones? Whooping cough like it's going out of style. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=431.0s)]
*  I do want to give the Missouri Republican Party a little bit of a shout out though. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=436.0s)]
*  Little salute, a little stiff armed salute perhaps. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=442.0s)]
*  This gentleman, not the one in the Klan robe with a sheet over his head, but the guy next to him. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=447.0s)]
*  And you can see him also in this photo. He is not the guy with the full Klan neo-Nazi uniform on with the tie on the right. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=454.0s)]
*  No, he's the guy next to him. You can see if you put the images next to each other, he's got the same little thing on in both images, the glasses around his neck on those like croquis style things. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=463.0s)]
*  Yes. So that guy, the one who with the burning cross behind him is making the Roman salute with the Klansman and then in the other photo with the neo-Nazi uniform guy in front of the neo-Nazi flag. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=472.0s)]
*  He is running for the Republican nomination for governor of the great state of Missouri. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=484.0s)]
*  And I said I wanted to shout out the Missouri Republican Party here and I do because they are now frantically trying to remove him from the ballot. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=491.0s)]
*  So the neo-Nazi Klan guy can't be their Republican nominee for governor. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=499.0s)]
*  Once they announced that they were trying to get him off the ballot, he responded this weekend saying, quote, the GOP knew exactly who I am. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=505.0s)]
*  Republicans in Missouri, including the Missouri Secretary of State, are trying to get him off the ballot now fast while also trying to explain away what appear to be themselves like taking pictures with that guy. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=515.0s)]
*  Well, he says you knew exactly who I was. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=527.0s)]
*  You want one from Georgia? In Georgia, Republicans there are on the cusp of approving a new license plate, a new official license plate for the state of Georgia. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=532.0s)]
*  And this one comes with a little history. In 1944, right, this is the apex of the Allies final push to defeat the Nazis and win World War II. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=541.0s)]
*  When FDR was running for his fourth term in office, the Republicans ran Thomas Dewey against him in the 1944 election. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=550.0s)]
*  There was also a third party in the mix in 1944. They ran a preacher for president in 1944 who called himself a Christian nationalist. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=557.0s)]
*  He ran on a platform that said that all American Jews should be forcibly sterilized and then deported from the United States. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=565.0s)]
*  That party was called the America First Party. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=573.0s)]
*  Around the same time, there was also an organization called America First, Incorporated, America First, Inc. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=577.0s)]
*  The leader of that group received a patent for a club that he said was specifically designed to murder Jews in America. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=583.0s)]
*  He patented it in men's and ladies sizes. He called it the kike killer. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=590.0s)]
*  Forgive me. He ran an organization called America First, Inc. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=595.0s)]
*  Both those organizations, the America First Party and America First, Inc. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=600.0s)]
*  America First, Inc. in the 1940s were trying to capitalize on the notoriety and the name recognition of the America First Committee, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=604.0s)]
*  which had at one point been very popular in the United States, but it started to wobble a little bit after its chief spokesman in 1941, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=611.0s)]
*  Charles Lindbergh, gave a big speech in Iowa saying the only reason we were going to end up fighting in World War II is because the Jews were going to make us do it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=618.0s)]
*  America First Committee and the America First Party and America First, Inc. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=628.0s)]
*  Georgia Republicans are about to approve a new taxpayer-supported official state Georgia license plate that says America First on it. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=633.0s)]
*  The Republican Party is kind of amazing right now. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=643.0s)]
*  No matter where you look, no matter what state you look, contraception, if you're trying not to have a baby, that's over. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=648.0s)]
*  IVF, if you're trying to have a baby, that's over too. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=655.0s)]
*  The Holocaust denier should be the Republican nominee for governor. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=658.0s)]
*  The Sterilize the Jews and Deport the Movement should be memorialized on official state Georgia license plates. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=662.0s)]
*  We want really, really, really small government that's nevertheless big enough to make an Oklahoma state registry of every woman who's ever had an abortion, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=669.0s)]
*  and we'll tell you later what we're going to do with it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=677.0s)]
*  Slaves had it great, actually. Slavery wasn't so bad. Let Florida Republicans tell you about it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=679.0s)]
*  It's retirees. It's the AARP that's the real evil in America. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=684.0s)]
*  Tetanus and measles, honestly, they're kind of cute when it's for babies. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=688.0s)]
*  And did I mention that on Friday the leader of the Republican Party, the next Republican presidential nominee, is going to host at his home the authoritarian dictator of Hungary? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=693.0s)]
*  Because dictators are kind of a thing for those guys right now, like polio is. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=703.0s)]
*  We're back! [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=708.0s)]
*  We're back! [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=709.0s)]
*  I mean, the Republican Party is going through some things right now. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=712.0s)]
*  Right up to the top, and in every state in the country. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=717.0s)]
*  When the Republican frontrunner remembers that it's a man named Joe Biden who he's running against and not Barack Obama, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=721.0s)]
*  the whole basis for that campaign against Biden, as you know, is that Biden's out of it, that Biden's old and stuff, right? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=727.0s)]
*  Trump's 77, Biden's 81. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=735.0s)]
*  A new AP poll out today says six in ten voters have worries about the mental capacity of each of them. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=737.0s)]
*  About 57 percent of voters say they have that worry about Trump. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=743.0s)]
*  About 63 percent say they have that worry about Biden. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=746.0s)]
*  The margin of error in this poll is just over four percent. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=749.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, it's kind of a tie. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=752.0s)]
*  I think the headline here on the AP story about this today is about right. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=754.0s)]
*  About six in ten voters in America have worries about both of these old dudes maybe being too old and out of it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=758.0s)]
*  But that's who the two parties are running. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=765.0s)]
*  So pick one. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=767.0s)]
*  Right. Pick one. That's your choice. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=769.0s)]
*  Pick one. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=771.0s)]
*  I mean, they you have lots of grounds on which to choose. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=772.0s)]
*  They have also, you know, both been president, which is a rare thing you get to choose from among presidential candidates. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=775.0s)]
*  But that lets us compare them. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=782.0s)]
*  In the past three plus years that Joe Biden has been president, we've got unemployment below four percent. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=784.0s)]
*  Best job market since so depending on the count, the 1960s violent crime at nearly a 50 year low. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=791.0s)]
*  The United States has had the best economic recovery since covid of any large country in the world. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=797.0s)]
*  The stock market has hit record after record. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=802.0s)]
*  More Americans have health insurance than ever before. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=804.0s)]
*  He's standing up against Putin, who's one of the least popular figures in the world with American voters. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=807.0s)]
*  He's fighting for reproductive rights, which is something even red state voters say they want. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=812.0s)]
*  All Republicans are stripping those rights aggressively everywhere. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=816.0s)]
*  He's cutting student loan debt while Republicans are trying to stop him from doing that. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=819.0s)]
*  He has brokered and signed the biggest bipartisan infrastructure deal ever in the history of the country. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=823.0s)]
*  Unions have never been more popular in my entire lifetime. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=829.0s)]
*  And I'm old and he's the first president ever to join the picket line with striking autoworkers who then won their strike and then endorsed him. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=833.0s)]
*  His Democratic Party has outperformed the polls and outperformed history in the midterms and in all of the off year elections since he has been president. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=840.0s)]
*  While on the other side, his opponent has been indicted 91 times. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=848.0s)]
*  And don't forget that his opponent was just president right before this. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=852.0s)]
*  Which we remember. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=858.0s)]
*  And even if we don't, in the three plus years that he's been gone from the White House, we have learned some real doozies about what exactly was going on there. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=861.0s)]
*  The new photos released showing boxes of documents stashed in a ballroom, even a bathroom, at his Mar-a-Lago home. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=872.0s)]
*  The indictment saying among the classified documents found in the boxes, information about U.S. nuclear programs. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=880.0s)]
*  I overheard the president say something to the effect of, you know, I don't f-ing care that they have weapons. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=887.0s)]
*  They're not here to hurt me. Take the f-ing mags away. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=892.0s)]
*  I'm not here to let my people in. They can march the Capitol from here, let the people in, take the f-ing mags away. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=896.0s)]
*  A two billion dollar investment that former President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner secured last summer from a fund led by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia has raised questions about the ethics of post-White House business dealings. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=901.0s)]
*  We're back with Cassidy Etchison. Cassidy, what was Mark Meadow's burning every day? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=917.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wish I knew, Nicole. There were several times I would walk into Mark's office and I would see him putting papers into the fireplace. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=922.0s)]
*  Eventually it culminated the long break, simmering break between he and myself in June of 2020 when he wanted to deploy active duty troops on the street of Washington, D.C. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=931.0s)]
*  And suggested actually that we shoot American, Americans in the streets. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=941.0s)]
*  He suggested that we deploy active duty troops in Washington and shoot Americans in the streets, says his defense secretary. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=946.0s)]
*  And the White House chief of staff was regularly burning documents in the White House fireplaces. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=955.0s)]
*  And the son-in-law mysteriously gets a two billion dollar housewarming present from a foreign government the second he walks out of the White House. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=960.0s)]
*  And he's stashing classified documents about America's nuclear programs at home in a bathroom and then refusing to give them back. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=967.0s)]
*  And he's explicitly asking for armed people to be let into the crowd he was going to direct to go to Congress to overthrow the government to try to keep him in power. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=974.0s)]
*  Those are just those are just that's just a sprinkling of the things we have learned about his time in office since he left office. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=986.0s)]
*  Today there's actually another one new reporting from Rolling Stone. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=994.0s)]
*  Look at this headline. Trump's White House was awash in speed. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=998.0s)]
*  And I don't mean speed as in efficiency. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1002.0s)]
*  I mean speed as in everyone was on drugs. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1005.0s)]
*  Who wants those guys back in the White House? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1009.0s)]
*  Because the two major parties are going to nominate someone and you got to pick one. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1012.0s)]
*  Which would you prefer? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1016.0s)]
*  You have to pick one. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1018.0s)]
*  We're actually going to speak with the lead reporter from that Rolling Stone story in just a moment. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1020.0s)]
*  But I will just leave you with this. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1025.0s)]
*  There there's no magic spell. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1028.0s)]
*  There's no solution that is going to come say from the Supreme Court. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1030.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court did the favor of reminding us all of that today when they ruled that Trump will stay on the ballot all over the country. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1035.0s)]
*  They gave us that reminder today after last week. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1042.0s)]
*  They made sure we knew it in the first place when they someone inexplicably took action to delay all the Trump the Trump criminal trials except the one they couldn't stop until after the election. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1045.0s)]
*  There's no magic wand coming to stop this thing. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1060.0s)]
*  There's no you know magic beans that you can grow here that makes some beanstalk take us away from all of this. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1063.0s)]
*  There's only one way out of this. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1069.0s)]
*  Pick one. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1071.0s)]
*  The Democratic Party has picked its nominee. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1073.0s)]
*  Yes it's an old guy who is doing practical normal and popular things as president and who has a lot to show for it particularly in terms of how well things are going economically since he has been at the helm. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1076.0s)]
*  The Republican Party is pretty obviously picking their guy as well. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1087.0s)]
*  Also an old guy who for example cannot say the word Venezuela and who has no idea who is the current president of the United States. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1091.0s)]
*  Currently riding high on his party's abortion bans and measles curious virological denialist free associating. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1098.0s)]
*  He's trying to warm the American people up to the idea of just a little bit of dictatorship from him and he's getting us ready to you know start building camps to hold millions because his advisors say the deportation start at noon on day one. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1105.0s)]
*  The courts are not going to help. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1120.0s)]
*  The law will be a sidebar to the main decision. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1125.0s)]
*  You will make this decision. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1129.0s)]
*  The only way this decision will be made is by you picking one by you volunteering and donating and campaigning and deciding it matters enough to you to not only vote but to help to help your candidate try to win. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1131.0s)]
*  The Republican Party really really is amazing right now. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1147.0s)]
*  But the only thing that will stop them is Democrats winning instead. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1151.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1158.0s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1159.0s)]
*  Thank you United States Supreme Court for the clarification the campaign. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1160.0s)]
*  If we didn't know it already the campaign starts now. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1163.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN0eSIXYpXo&t=1177.0s)]
