# One Way Putin's Ill-Considered Invasion Of Ukraine Will Likely Backfire
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA)
*  What is the role of the United States military in trying to limit the danger that you're describing, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=0.0s)]
*  in trying to increase the pain, reduce the potential reward for Putin here? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=6.32s)]
*  Obviously, President Biden is clear as day that there's not going to be any U.S. troops fighting in Ukraine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=12.4s)]
*  But we are seeing thousands of Americans deployed to Ukraine's borders. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=17.92s)]
*  And that wouldn't be happening if there wasn't a reason to do it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=24.32s)]
*  What does the U.S. military contribute to America's capabilities here, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  as Putin seems to still be expanding his attack? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=35.68s)]
*  Well, of course, as is designed in our Constitution, the military is an instrument [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=39.12s)]
*  for use by the civilian leadership. And so, frankly, I have to say, as an old retired guy, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=45.2s)]
*  I'm very proud of how quickly U.S. Army Europe, U.S. European Command, our great Air Force, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=50.32s)]
*  how everybody has reacted and responded to move capabilities around, to put them in place in time [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=57.36s)]
*  to give our political leaders some options, and also to signal to the Kremlin that this is not some [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=63.76s)]
*  exercise, this is not an academic thing, this is for real, and we are prepared. And that's the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  essential nature of deterrence. Now, I had a good friend from Lithuania a couple of years ago [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=76.56s)]
*  was talking to me about how much they wanted to have American soldiers there. I said, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=83.36s)]
*  why is it so important to have Americans here? We have allies from multiple countries. He said, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=89.12s)]
*  General Hodges, Russia has never fought against American soldiers. They are scared of American [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=94.0s)]
*  soldiers. That's why we all want American soldiers, Americans here. And I think, actually, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=99.36000000000001s)]
*  this is probably going to be one of the outcomes of President Putin's reckless [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  and terrible calculations. He's going to end up with permanent basing of American soldiers in Poland, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=111.28s)]
*  Lithuania, Romania, Latvia, and Estonia. Instead of rotational, he's going to have permanent on his [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=118.0s)]
*  doorstep because all of these countries know what it's like. And we all recognize now what the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=124.8s)]
*  Kremlin is up to and what Putin is willing to do. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=132.88s)]
*  Yeah. He's settled the argument as to his malign intentions. He has proven all of his worst critics [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  correct in an irrefutable way. Retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, former commander of the U.S. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  Army in Europe, General, it is great to see you. Come back soon. I'd love to have you back as soon [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=149.76s)]
*  as you're ready. Thank you, Rach. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=154.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLD-epYYDA&t=166.48s)]
