# Trump's dictatorial dreams tripped up by the democratic problem of public opinion
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg)
*  Public opinion is what democracy is all about. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=0.0s)]
*  And the things that Trump is doing, broadly speaking, cut against public opinion. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=4.0s)]
*  They also have the benefit of being very poorly conceived and poorly executed. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=11.0s)]
*  I mean, just take this tariff humiliation of the past 48 hours. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=15.0s)]
*  This was like his signature issue for the campaign. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=20.0s)]
*  You thought—you think he might have had some time to, like, think this through? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=22.0s)]
*  No, apparently. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=25.0s)]
*  And so it has been a humiliating 48 hours for President Trump on this tariff issue. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=27.0s)]
*  As soon as he announced these inexplicable tariffs on Canada and Mexico, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=32.0s)]
*  the stock market fell through the floor. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=36.0s)]
*  There was a widespread freakout on Wall Street, totally predictable. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=38.0s)]
*  There was a widespread freakout in the press. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=42.0s)]
*  Lots of Republicans and conservatives were among those freaked out. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=44.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal called it, quote, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=48.0s)]
*  the dumbest trade war in history. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=50.0s)]
*  Yeah, everybody turns out, thought it was a bad idea, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=53.0s)]
*  and it was going to be really expensive for us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=55.0s)]
*  And so Trump climbed right down. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=60.0s)]
*  Within 24 hours, he had calls with Canada and Mexico, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=62.0s)]
*  where Canada and Mexico reiterated that they would do things they had already offered to do. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=66.0s)]
*  He got nothing new out of them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=71.0s)]
*  Mexico, in addition, got Trump to agree to do something for them. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=73.0s)]
*  Mexico got Trump to agree to stop U.S. guns flowing into Mexico. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=78.0s)]
*  So Mexico ended up getting concessions from us. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=83.0s)]
*  And there's no tariffs on Mexico, and there's no tariffs on Canada. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=86.0s)]
*  The whole thing evaporated because Trump climbed right down. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=90.0s)]
*  Except for the tariffs with China, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=93.0s)]
*  where China retaliated against us with bigger tariffs than we put on them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=95.0s)]
*  And that's now the state of play. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=101.0s)]
*  So now we have bigger tariffs on us from China that we have put on China. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=103.0s)]
*  And now it would appear that Trump can't get the Chinese leadership on the phone [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=107.0s)]
*  He was due to talk with Xi Jinping in China today, but that didn't happen. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=112.0s)]
*  Then they said, no, maybe it's going to happen tomorrow. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=117.0s)]
*  Now they're saying, hmm, we don't actually know when that's going to happen. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=120.0s)]
*  But never mind, we don't care if we don't talk. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=123.0s)]
*  While we're under larger tariffs from them than they are from us. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=126.0s)]
*  Great move. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=131.0s)]
*  It is hapless, and he is flailing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=133.0s)]
*  And not for nothing, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=137.0s)]
*  China can actually keep up those high tariffs on us as long as they want to, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=139.0s)]
*  even if those tariffs do hurt their own economy and their own consumers. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=144.0s)]
*  Why can they keep that up indefinitely? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=149.0s)]
*  Because, oh, yeah, they're a dictatorship. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=151.0s)]
*  They don't have to care about their people or what their people think. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=153.0s)]
*  They don't answer to their people. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=156.0s)]
*  Our government does have to answer to what people think. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=158.0s)]
*  I mean, look, look at, look at stopping foreign aid. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=162.0s)]
*  That's one where they think they've got such a strong case [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=167.0s)]
*  and they've got such a good message to the American people, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=170.0s)]
*  nobody cares about foreign aid. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=172.0s)]
*  We can absolutely, what did, what did Elon Musk say? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=174.0s)]
*  Put that through the woodchipper and everybody will cheer. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=176.0s)]
*  Nobody will care. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=179.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=180.0s)]
*  Well, here are Republican senators in good standing. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=181.0s)]
*  Here's Senator Roger Wicker. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=185.0s)]
*  Here's Senator Bill Cassidy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=187.0s)]
*  Here's Senator Jerry Moran saying, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, wait a second. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=189.0s)]
*  You can't stop all this foreign aid. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=192.0s)]
*  That's American food aid that's going to rot in the ports, says Jerry Moran. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=194.0s)]
*  That's, that's an HIV treatment program that needs to be restarted immediately, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=199.0s)]
*  says physician and Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=204.0s)]
*  I mean, the pushback is real. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=211.0s)]
*  It's emboldened in part by the stupidity [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=214.0s)]
*  and palpable incompetence of the administration [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=219.0s)]
*  that's trying to push everybody around. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=223.0s)]
*  The pushback is real. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=225.0s)]
*  It is emboldened and it is coming from every direction. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=226.0s)]
*  The protest we saw yesterday at the USAID building [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=229.0s)]
*  to stick up for USAID and foreign aid. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=232.0s)]
*  That was a big deal. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=236.0s)]
*  An impromptu demonstration that attracted [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=237.0s)]
*  tons of members of Congress, tons of people, tons of media. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=239.0s)]
*  There's going to be another demonstration for that same cause tomorrow, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=242.0s)]
*  again, with members of Congress. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=245.0s)]
*  This time it's going to be 1130 a.m., [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=247.0s)]
*  1130 a.m. at Upper Senate Park, which is on Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=249.0s)]
*  Standing up for USAID, standing up for foreign aid. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=254.0s)]
*  There are some reports that we're going to see some level of protest [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=257.0s)]
*  at all 50 state capitals tomorrow. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=260.0s)]
*  We'll see how that turns out. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=262.0s)]
*  This was the U.S. Treasury building today. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=264.0s)]
*  I told you yesterday there was going to be protest today [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=267.0s)]
*  at the U.S. Treasury building at 5 o'clock in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=269.0s)]
*  Look at the people that turned out. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=273.0s)]
*  Look how big this was. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=274.0s)]
*  This is formal federal workers. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=277.0s)]
*  This is Democratic officials. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=279.0s)]
*  This is regular people turning up at the U.S. Treasury building today, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=281.0s)]
*  telling Elon Musk and his little minions [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=284.0s)]
*  to get out of the Treasury payment system, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=286.0s)]
*  trying to stop this whole assault on the federal government. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=289.0s)]
*  Look at this today. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=291.0s)]
*  What the Trump administration is doing is unpopular and poorly thought out [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=294.0s)]
*  and poorly executed and getting more so all the time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=298.0s)]
*  Tonight Trump, I guess, is saying he's going to send U.S. troops [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=301.0s)]
*  into Occupy the Gaza Strip [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=306.0s)]
*  to level it and depopulate it of its population. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=309.0s)]
*  He says that's going to be a long-term U.S. military operation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=313.0s)]
*  Okay, sure, yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=319.0s)]
*  The American people definitely voted for sending troops into Gaza. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=320.0s)]
*  Is that what this election was about? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=323.0s)]
*  I think you've got a big Trump mandate for that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=326.0s)]
*  Corporal Vance, you going to suit back up for that? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=328.0s)]
*  Today they sent out another, even more threatening letter [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=333.0s)]
*  to federal employees saying resign by midnight tomorrow or else. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=337.0s)]
*  I mean, their intent really does appear to be as radical and destructive [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=342.0s)]
*  as anything anyone imagined before they took office. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=346.0s)]
*  What they are intending and trying to do, though, is unpopular. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=349.0s)]
*  Their execution is shambolic and often palpably dumb. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=353.0s)]
*  And the opposition is now awake and increasingly emboldened. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=358.0s)]
*  I told you it's on, man. It is on. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvPEysxCwfg&t=363.0s)]
