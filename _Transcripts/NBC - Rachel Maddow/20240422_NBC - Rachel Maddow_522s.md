Video Description: Donald Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche was interrupted during his opening statement by objections from the prosecution that were sustained by the judge and resulted in a side bar at the bench. Rachel Maddow talks with MSNBC legal correspondent Lisa Ruben and former Manhattan prosecutor Catherine Christian about whether Blanche showed his inexperience as a defense attorney or whether he deliberately stepped out of line to plant ideas in the jurors' heads.

# Trump's defense stumbles out of the gate with interruptions to opening statement
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE)
*  Trump's lawyer, defense counsel Todd Blanch, was in the middle of his opening statements [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=0.0s)]
*  today when something unusual happened. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=4.3s)]
*  Todd Blanch, Trump defense counsel, quote, Michael Cohen paying Stormy Daniels or Stephanie [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=7.38s)]
*  Clifford $130,000 in exchange for her agreeing to not publicly spread false, false claims [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=12.34s)]
*  about President Trump is not illegal. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to say that again, entering into a non-disclosure agreement, prosecutor, objection, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=21.8s)]
*  judge sustained. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=28.22s)]
*  Mr Blanch, entering into a non-disclosure agreement is perfectly legal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=30.619999999999997s)]
*  Prosecution, objection, the judge overruled. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=35.54s)]
*  Mr Blanch then continues on for a moment, then it happens again pretty much right away. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=40.14s)]
*  Todd Blanch, when Ms. Daniels threatened to go public with her false claim of a sexual [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=43.58s)]
*  encounter with President Trump back in 2008, that it was, as the people just said, very [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=47.78s)]
*  close to the election and it was almost an attempt by Ms. Clifford, Ms. Daniels to extort [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=57.14s)]
*  Prosecutor, objection, judge sustained. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=58.14s)]
*  Blanch then tries to keep going, but then a moment later, Mr Blanch, again, entering [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=62.38s)]
*  into an agreement with another individual, you'll hear this agreement was negotiated [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=67.46000000000001s)]
*  by lawyers. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=71.26s)]
*  Prosecutor, objection. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=72.9s)]
*  Now, at this point, Judge Marchand does not even rule on the objection. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=73.9s)]
*  He doesn't say sustained, doesn't say overruled. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  He instead calls lawyers from both sides up to the bench. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=80.06s)]
*  Please approach. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=84.58s)]
*  The lawyers and the judge then confer and then the judge rules. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=85.58s)]
*  Judge, the objection is sustained. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=89.86s)]
*  Then Mr Blanch, Trump's lawyer, moves on to another topic. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=92.9s)]
*  But he makes it just three further pages into the transcript when the whole thing starts [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=96.22s)]
*  all over again. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=99.84s)]
*  This time, it's over a mention of Michael Cohen, Todd Blanch, Trump's defense counsel. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=100.84s)]
*  Quote, separately from his obsession with President Trump and his obsession to get President [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=104.74s)]
*  Trump, on multiple occasions, Michael Cohen has testified under oath and lied. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=108.48s)]
*  Prosecutor, objection. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=112.34s)]
*  Judge, sustained. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=113.34s)]
*  Blanch, he's walked into a courtroom very near here, raised his right hand and swore [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=114.34s)]
*  to tell the truth. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=121.5s)]
*  And now he will tell you, I expect, that he was lying. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=122.5s)]
*  Prosecutor, objection. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=125.22s)]
*  Judge, sustained. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=126.22s)]
*  Then for a second time, the judge calls up the lawyers from both sides to the bench. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=129.22s)]
*  To the bench. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=133.54s)]
*  Counsel, please approach. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=134.54s)]
*  And a second time, he upholds the objection. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=136.02s)]
*  Judge Marchand, the objection is sustained. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=138.82s)]
*  Now, I was in the court when this string of objections happened in the middle of Trump's [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=141.34s)]
*  team's opening statements. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=147.34s)]
*  Both sides getting repeatedly hauled up before the judge. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=149.62s)]
*  The reporter, excuse me, the lawyer having to restart what he was saying, try to find [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=152.34s)]
*  his momentum again, pick back up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=156.1s)]
*  To me as a layperson, it seemed dramatic and strange. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=158.18s)]
*  But I want to ask our lawyers here, how rare is it for objections to be made during opening [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  statements? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=167.22s)]
*  For the judge to interrupt opening statements with multiple directions to the lawyers, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=168.3s)]
*  including the one making the opening statement that they've got to come up to the bench [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=173.54s)]
*  and talk to the judge. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=175.86s)]
*  Why were these objections made? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=177.94s)]
*  What does this tell us about the trial and about the defense that Trump's lawyer is trying [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=179.14s)]
*  to make? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=182.14s)]
*  Luckily, joining us now is Lisa Rubin, who was at the courthouse today in the overflow [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=183.14s)]
*  room. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=186.86s)]
*  Lisa, I understand that part of your sacrifice today was allowing me to be in the courtroom [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=187.86s)]
*  in a seat that you might otherwise have had your butt in. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=191.22s)]
*  It was not a sacrifice. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=193.42s)]
*  I am very grateful and I hereby bequeath back to you your seat. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=195.14s)]
*  Thank you, I think. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=198.77999999999997s)]
*  Well, you actually in some ways in the overflow room might have had a slightly better view [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=200.66s)]
*  of this than I did sitting at the back of the courtroom watching it sort of down the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  aisle. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  What was happening there and how weird was it? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  So it was weird, not just because there was one objection, but because of how many there [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=211.22s)]
*  were relative to the brevity of Todd Blanch's opening statement. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=215.42s)]
*  Let's start with the fact that Todd Blanch was an experienced prosecutor in the Southern [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=219.98s)]
*  District of New York. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=223.45999999999998s)]
*  What he's not is an experienced defense lawyer. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=224.78s)]
*  We learned today from New York Magazine something that confirms something that I suspected, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=227.26000000000002s)]
*  which is that Todd Blanch has tried exactly one trial as defense counsel in the last decade [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=231.18s)]
*  and on a fairly narrow issue. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=236.5s)]
*  And if you were just in that courtroom, you probably would have expected as much because [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  his flow was interrupted so many times by these frequent objections and the sidebars. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=242.46s)]
*  Now that having been said, Rachel, I think a number of the things that he did today were [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=248.06s)]
*  perfectly intentional because while they were objected to and the objections were sustained, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=252.38s)]
*  he still planted the seeds of doubt in the jurors' minds. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=256.82s)]
*  And in particular, for example, when he said that Stormy Daniels made Donald Trump a victim [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=260.26s)]
*  of extortion, that was immediately objected to and sustained because that, among other [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=265.26s)]
*  things, is a legal conclusion. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  There was no prosecution, for example, of Stormy Daniels for extorting Donald Trump. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=270.7s)]
*  And he would have known in advance that the judge was not going to allow him to get away [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=275.26s)]
*  with saying that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=278.26s)]
*  I think that's probably right. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=279.26s)]
*  There are other objections where he definitely knew. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=281.14s)]
*  And I think the place where he definitely knew was when he talked about what I'll call [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=284.02s)]
*  the diet advice of counsel defense, where he essentially said Trump believed that these [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=287.18s)]
*  nondisclosure agreements were totally kosher because he had attorneys negotiating them [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=292.86s)]
*  for him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=297.66s)]
*  That's an issue that's already been litigated as part of the party's motions in limine, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=298.66s)]
*  which are the advanced arguments about which evidence can and can't come in. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=302.38s)]
*  Todd Blanch knew when he walked in the courtroom this morning that that was not going to be [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=306.34s)]
*  an argument allowed because he was trying to use the attorney-client privilege as a [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=309.94s)]
*  sword and a shield, essentially saying, my client relied on lawyer's advice, but we're [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=313.5s)]
*  not going to tell you what that advice was. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=318.34s)]
*  And just like Judge Kaplan did in the Sam Bankman Freed case, in fact, Judge Marchand [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=320.98s)]
*  cited that ruling in making his own, I'm not going to let your client do that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=324.7s)]
*  There is no advice of counsel light, and yet that's where Blanch still went. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=329.02s)]
*  I'm going to give an instruction now that nobody knows is coming, and I know it's going [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=333.74s)]
*  to make everybody move around. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=337.42s)]
*  But I'd like to talk to Katherine Christian if I could. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=338.42s)]
*  She's on the other side of the room, and lots of cameras have to move, I realize, in order [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=341.22s)]
*  to make this possible. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=344.46000000000004s)]
*  Hi, Katherine, thank you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  You have experience in the New York District Attorney's Office. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  What Lisa's describing here about Mr. Blanch's relative inexperience doing this kind of lawyering [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=352.26s)]
*  and this kind of a case is one piece of perspective here. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=358.62s)]
*  Another piece of perspective here is what's normal in a New York DA criminal proceeding [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=362.66s)]
*  like this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=368.14s)]
*  When these interruptions, these objections happened during the opening statements here [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=369.14s)]
*  from the defense, how did that strike you? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=374.3s)]
*  It's not unusual. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=376.9s)]
*  Andrew and I will probably have a different experience. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=377.9s)]
*  New York State Court is not as dainty as federal court, so it's not shocking. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=380.58s)]
*  And defense attorneys, some of them pride themselves on stepping on the line. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=385.86s)]
*  So I had objected when I was a prosecutor because they stepped on the line, and as Lisa [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=390.7s)]
*  said, oopsie, the jury heard what he said, so it's in their head. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=397.3s)]
*  So this, I can't say it happens all the time, but it's not shocking. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=402.38s)]
*  I rarely objected as a prosecutor because I didn't want the jury to think that I was [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=406.38s)]
*  trying to hide something from them or I was afraid. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=410.94s)]
*  Here I would have objected because he was clearly saying things he shouldn't have and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=413.7s)]
*  the judge already ruled against. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=416.94s)]
*  But it's not shocking, at least not in the world of 100 Cent District in New York County. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=418.8s)]
*  And Katherine, let me ask you about something Katie Fank said earlier, where she said that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=423.58s)]
*  in the minds of the jury, Mr. Blanch might have not done himself favors with all of those [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=427.62s)]
*  statements being objected to today and all those interruptions because the jury might [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=434.66s)]
*  have thought, even if those seeds were planted in their minds by things he wasn't supposed [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=438.18s)]
*  to say, that he nevertheless had them here, they at least would think that he was doing [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=441.48s)]
*  something wrong by being essentially sort of mini-sanctioned by the judge in that way [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZpPodIpYWE&t=445.26s)]
