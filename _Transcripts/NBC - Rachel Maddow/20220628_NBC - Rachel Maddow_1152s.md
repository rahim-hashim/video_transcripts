# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: June 27
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg)
*  President Trump, on behalf of all the MAGA patriots in America, I want to thank you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=0.0s)]
*  for the historic victory for white life in the Supreme Court yesterday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=8.6s)]
*  The historic victory for white life in the Supreme Court, yes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=19.68s)]
*  That was Illinois Republican congresswoman, member of Congress, Mary Miller, at a campaign [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=24.82s)]
*  rally with former President Trump this weekend. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=31.66s)]
*  Before that Saturday rally, Congresswoman Mary Miller was probably best known for telling [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=34.42s)]
*  attendees of a previous rally about what she thinks Hitler got right. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=39.92s)]
*  Hitler was right on what? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  Let me stop you there, ma'am. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=46.86s)]
*  But after the stuff Hitler was right about kind of faded into the background, there she [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=49.46s)]
*  was this weekend calling the Supreme Court's decision on Roe v. Wade a victory for white [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=54.94s)]
*  life. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=58.7s)]
*  Now, Congresswoman Mary Miller's office put out a statement saying that moment in her [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=59.7s)]
*  speech was a mistake, just a misstatement. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=63.8s)]
*  She meant to say the right to life. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=66.9s)]
*  But regardless of whether or not what she said was intentionally said or not, what she [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  actually said out loud, very clearly, was that the Supreme Court's ruling was a victory [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=74.14s)]
*  for white life. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=79.0s)]
*  And then you can see her there clapping along as the crowd gave a hearty cheer for white [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=80.88s)]
*  life. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=86.88s)]
*  And as the people in the Blacks for Trump t-shirts behind them kind of didn't know what [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=87.88s)]
*  to do. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=92.76s)]
*  The reason Trump held that rally this weekend with Congresswoman Hitler was right, Mary [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=95.44s)]
*  Miller, white life, is because tomorrow she's going to face off in a primary against one [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=100.08s)]
*  of her fellow Republican members of Congress. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=106.48s)]
*  Rodney Davis, a redistricting process in their state, squeezed those two Republicans into [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  one district. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=115.28s)]
*  And so they've got a primary tomorrow. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=116.28s)]
*  Trump is obviously supporting the Hitler was right victory for white life lady. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  Race tomorrow, we'll get to see whether or not she stays in Congress. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=123.84s)]
*  And so therefore, that'll certainly be one to watch. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=127.04s)]
*  But there are primary races tomorrow in eight states altogether. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=129.84s)]
*  That one's in Illinois. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  There are also races in Colorado, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=134.42s)]
*  Utah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=139.33999999999997s)]
*  And there's frankly a bunch of doozies in a bunch of those states. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=140.33999999999997s)]
*  Colorado Republicans tomorrow, for example, are going to be choosing their candidate for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=144.7s)]
*  the top job overseeing elections across the entire state of Colorado. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=149.61999999999998s)]
*  And one of the Republican candidates in that secretary of state race is this woman, Tina [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  Peters. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=159.1s)]
*  Now, if that name, Tina Peters, sounds familiar, it's because Tina Peters keeps making national [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=160.4s)]
*  news because she is the county clerk in Colorado who is currently under indictment charged [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=165.16s)]
*  with seven felonies and three misdemeanors after she allegedly tampered with official [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  voting equipment and gave sensitive voter information to election conspiracy theorists [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=175.7s)]
*  who then promptly posted it all online, including all the passwords. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  A Colorado judge has already barred Tina Peters from overseeing the 2022 elections in the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=185.84s)]
*  county where she's the county clerk. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  But now she is running to oversee elections for the entire state of Colorado. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=194.24s)]
*  Tina Peters, that said, is not the only that kind of candidate who's on the ballot in Colorado [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=200.24s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=205.2s)]
*  One of the Republican candidates in the primary race for governor tomorrow is this man, Greg [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=206.2s)]
*  Lopez. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=211.4s)]
*  He's running on a platform in Colorado that Republican votes should count more than Democratic [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=212.4s)]
*  votes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=218.12s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=219.12s)]
*  He says if he's governor, he will change Colorado's election law. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=220.12s)]
*  So votes from rural Republican leaning areas would count more, they'd be worth more than [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=225.26s)]
*  votes from urban Democratic leaning cities. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=230.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=234.96s)]
*  In Oklahoma tomorrow, Republicans are set to choose their candidate to replace retiring [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=237.68s)]
*  Senator James Mountain Inhofe. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=241.48s)]
*  Among the dozen or so Republicans running in that race is another familiar face. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=244.44s)]
*  His name is Scott Pruitt. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=249.4s)]
*  He was head of the EPA under Trump. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=250.88s)]
*  Remember him? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=252.84s)]
*  He's best known for competing sort of neck and neck with Trump's interior secretary, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=253.96s)]
*  Ryan Zinke, for the title of who could rack up the most scandals in the shortest tenure [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=257.96s)]
*  on Trump's cabinet. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=263.96s)]
*  Scott Pruitt's list of scandals at the APA was truly jaw dropping. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=265.52s)]
*  He ran the gamut from spending thousands of taxpayer dollars on private flights and tactical [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=269.56s)]
*  pants. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=275.16s)]
*  What tactics do pants use? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=276.72s)]
*  He allegedly used his office to try to get his wife her own Chick-fil-A franchise. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=278.88s)]
*  He also had taxpayers pay for a soundproof phone booth that he installed in his EPA administrator [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=283.6s)]
*  office for his high security soundproof chats. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=290.48s)]
*  Now he wants to be the Republican nominee for Senate in the great state of Oklahoma. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=295.64s)]
*  So, like I said, there's a lot of races to keep an eye on tomorrow. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=299.12s)]
*  In Illinois, Oklahoma, Illinois and Oklahoma, polls close at 8 o'clock Eastern time tomorrow. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=302.96s)]
*  In Colorado, polls are going to close at 9 p.m. Eastern. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=310.36s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=314.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, the former president, President Trump today, he saw shares in his new media [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=315.68s)]
*  company swirl down the toilet when the company had to announce in a regulatory filing that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=329.32s)]
*  its entire board of directors just got served with federal grand jury subpoenas from SDNY, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=334.2s)]
*  from federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=339.6s)]
*  It had previously been known that Trump's new media business venture was being investigated [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=341.92s)]
*  by the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and by an entity called FINRA, which is a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=347.0s)]
*  financial industry watchdog. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=351.88s)]
*  But now apparently it's federal prosecutors as well. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  So maybe that's a criminal investigation now? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, if you're trying to keep up, I think this is everything, but maybe there's more. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=360.32s)]
*  Just off the top of my head, the former president is facing state criminal investigators in [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  Georgia, an investigation there related to his effort to overthrow the government and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=371.44s)]
*  stay in power. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=374.96s)]
*  Also a state civil investigation in New York related to alleged fraud in his family business. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=376.56s)]
*  His family business has already been criminally indicted as well in New York. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=381.94s)]
*  His new media business may also now be under federal criminal investigation, per these [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=386.52s)]
*  brand new subpoenas that just went out. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=391.0s)]
*  One of his loyalist lawyers at the Justice Department who allegedly helped with his overthrow [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=393.28s)]
*  the government plot, he just had a search warrant executed at his home. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=397.04s)]
*  One of his outside lawyers who also allegedly helped with the overthrow of the government [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=400.68s)]
*  plot just had a search warrant executed for his phone. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=403.96s)]
*  I mean, this is fine, right? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=407.52s)]
*  This is normal. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=410.36s)]
*  There's eight states having primaries and runoff elections tomorrow, and it is amazing [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=412.48s)]
*  at a very basic level that people are still concerning themselves with the potency of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=416.52s)]
*  endorsements in some of those races from that guy who I just described. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=420.4s)]
*  I mean, we're trying to figure out if even his lawyers are potentially going to jail. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=424.8s)]
*  He's the most important figure in Republican Party politics still? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=434.88s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=437.88s)]
*  So this is new. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=445.88s)]
*  This is something I do not think we have seen before. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=446.88s)]
*  It's from the New York Times today. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=449.88s)]
*  Quote, within a few days, Just the Pill, a nonprofit organization that arranges for women [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=452.16s)]
*  to obtain abortion pills, Just the Pill plans to deploy in Colorado the first of what will [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=457.52s)]
*  become a fleet of mobile clinics to park along state borders, providing consultations [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=463.64s)]
*  for medication abortions and dispensing pills. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=470.08s)]
*  Called Quote Abortion Delivered, the Clinic on Wheels program will also provide surgical [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=473.96s)]
*  abortions for patients who prefer that or who are too far along in pregnancy for a medication [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=478.68s)]
*  abortion. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=483.47999999999996s)]
*  The program is designed to reach patients from states like Texas, Oklahoma and South [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=484.48s)]
*  Dakota that quickly outlawed abortion after the court decision, as well as other states [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=488.92s)]
*  like Utah that are expected to ban or sharply restrict abortion soon. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=493.56s)]
*  So that's one potential on the ground response to the Supreme Court decision overturning [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=497.8s)]
*  Roe vs. Wade, overturning the right to legal abortion. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=503.76s)]
*  Put abortion services on wheels and take them to the borders of states where abortion is [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=506.68s)]
*  outlawed. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  So American women can't get a legal abortion in state X, but if they take a few steps over [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=513.8399999999999s)]
*  the border from state X into state Y, then they can. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  Again, this was like sort of a, this was a thought experiment kind of idea. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=524.52s)]
*  This was a dystopian sci-fi concept in terms of how American women would still be able [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=529.0s)]
*  to retain the right to make decisions about the most intimate decisions in their lives. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=533.9599999999999s)]
*  It's now apparently going into effect within days. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=540.68s)]
*  Another way for women in states with abortion bans to access abortion may be for them to [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=544.64s)]
*  get abortion pills, which again you can use for many abortions within the first 10 weeks [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=550.56s)]
*  or so of pregnancy. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=555.28s)]
*  You could get abortion pills prescribed by a provider overseas, a provider in another [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=556.9599999999999s)]
*  country who is therefore beyond the reach of US state laws designed to block that sort [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=562.3s)]
*  of thing. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=566.8s)]
*  She has an approach pioneered by a doctor named Rebecca Gompertz. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=568.3s)]
*  She's a Dutch doctor. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=572.2199999999999s)]
*  She has spent decades figuring out innovative ways to get abortion services to women in [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=573.62s)]
*  countries where abortion is illegal. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=578.78s)]
*  Her organization Women on Waves has, for example, provided abortions on ships floating in international [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=581.5799999999999s)]
*  waters. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=588.38s)]
*  She then created Women on Web to mail abortion pills to patients all around the globe. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=589.38s)]
*  In 2018, she saw into the future and decided that the United States was joining the ranks [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=595.02s)]
*  of countries needing her group's services. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=601.02s)]
*  She then launched a group called Aid Access. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=603.9s)]
*  It's specifically to provide medication abortions to patients in the United States in states [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=606.02s)]
*  that had banned telemedicine abortions. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=611.4s)]
*  Physicians overseas do the video consultations with women in the US, and then the pills are [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=614.36s)]
*  often mailed from overseas as well. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=619.38s)]
*  We have entered a new era in America now, one in which an overseas organization like [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=623.26s)]
*  Aid Access will not just be the only way to get a telemedicine abortion in many states. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=627.26s)]
*  It may be the only way, period, to get an abortion in about half the states in the Union. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=632.02s)]
*  The work that Dr. Gompertz has been doing globally, figuring out how to get women abortion [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=638.06s)]
*  services when their countries have made it illegal, that's that work that's going to [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=643.06s)]
*  need to be done across borders inside the United States as well, figuring out how to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=648.34s)]
*  get abortion services to women in states where it is illegal. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=652.66s)]
*  The time has come. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=659.1s)]
*  What do Americans now need to learn? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=660.38s)]
*  What can Americans learn from somebody who has been doing this pioneering work for decades? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=662.8199999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is Dr. Rebecca Gompertz. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=668.66s)]
*  She is the founder of Women on Waves and Aid Access. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=670.1s)]
*  Dr. Gompertz, I really appreciate you joining us, especially given how late it is where [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=673.1s)]
*  you are. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=677.1s)]
*  It's really kind of you to be here. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=678.1s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel, for inviting me. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=679.1s)]
*  I'm very happy to be here, Michelle. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=681.66s)]
*  Let me ask you first about the Roe vs. Wade decision by the United States Supreme Court. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=684.66s)]
*  I think it was not, it could not be described as a surprise in this country, even though [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=690.1s)]
*  I think it was still a shock. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=694.9399999999999s)]
*  I know enough about your work to know that you probably saw it coming better than maybe [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=697.3399999999999s)]
*  some of us here did. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=702.78s)]
*  And you were also taking steps even ahead of that ruling to try to mitigate some of [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=704.86s)]
*  the severe restrictions that states had already put on abortion access, even with the Roe [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=709.8199999999999s)]
*  law still in place. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=715.14s)]
*  Well, we started getting a lot of requests from women from the United States already [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=717.18s)]
*  for a few years with Women on Waves. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=723.66s)]
*  And the reasons that women were looking for access was because they could often not afford [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=726.9s)]
*  the abortion services locally, but also privacy reasons. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=732.26s)]
*  For example, people that were living in domestic violence or they couldn't travel because the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=737.5s)]
*  distances to travel were already quite long. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=744.1800000000001s)]
*  So there were already women that were not able to access abortions in the US before [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=747.1800000000001s)]
*  the ruling. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=753.6600000000001s)]
*  And it's just really unfortunate that Trump has been able to appoint three court judges [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=755.62s)]
*  to the Supreme Court. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=761.26s)]
*  And now that Roe vs. Wade has been overturned. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=762.86s)]
*  And of course, here in Europe, we really look with trembling to see how also many of the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=765.06s)]
*  other human rights that have been recognized for long in the United States might now be [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=771.3s)]
*  over, might now be disappear, basically. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=774.9799999999999s)]
*  You have pioneered from an international perspective, this tactic essentially of getting women access [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=780.54s)]
*  to medication abortion, getting them the pills in ways that essentially work around [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=787.66s)]
*  restrictions at the local or national level that are designed to prevent that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=794.66s)]
*  What should Americans now understand about whether or not medication abortion can offer [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=799.02s)]
*  American women a way to retain this right once states try to make it go away? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=805.42s)]
*  We have already seen some Republican controlled states say they will essentially try to block [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=810.54s)]
*  women from getting abortion medications, from getting pills any way they can, trying to [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=814.9s)]
*  block them from being sent through the mail, trying to block women from even leaving to [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=819.62s)]
*  go to other states to get them. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=823.38s)]
*  What do you see about the sort of height of that legal barrier when it comes to medication [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=825.58s)]
*  abortion specifically? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=829.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, we see in other countries where abortion is illegal is that there's no way that those [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=830.1800000000001s)]
*  pills can be stopped. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=836.74s)]
*  There will be women's organizations, other people that will bring in the medicines and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=838.82s)]
*  make sure that women will have it and be able to use it when they need it. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=843.3000000000001s)]
*  I think what is going to be, it will make it much harder for many and especially the [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=850.9399999999999s)]
*  more vulnerable women, for them it might be really not possible to get pills. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=857.26s)]
*  What we see is that it won't stop people from having abortions and these are actually also [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=864.1s)]
*  emails that we already received with Aid Access where people were writing about how they were [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=867.9s)]
*  trying to induce their abortions by, for example, using herbs or jumping off stairs or using [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=872.42s)]
*  knitting needles. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=879.28s)]
*  There will be women that will not be able to access the pills and will also try to harm [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=880.9599999999999s)]
*  themselves to end pregnancies. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=886.56s)]
*  And then of course the later, the women that are later in pregnancies, the pills can still [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=891.4s)]
*  be used. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=897.0799999999999s)]
*  It's still safe to use them also after 12 weeks. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=898.0799999999999s)]
*  The World Health Organization is supporting home use till 12 weeks, but afterwards the [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=901.4399999999999s)]
*  research now shows that it's also safe to do, but people have to be close to emergency [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=906.4599999999999s)]
*  care. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=911.74s)]
*  And one of the concerns that we have is that we've seen that sometimes doctors that work [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=912.74s)]
*  in emergency wards, they don't want to help people when they present with a miscarriage [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=917.18s)]
*  or an abortion because they are scared that that would make them, that they could be prosecuted [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=923.3399999999999s)]
*  under strict abortion laws. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=929.5799999999999s)]
*  So for example, in Ireland, a woman died because this happened and important as well. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=931.94s)]
*  And I think one of the things that's very important to teach the doctors that they can [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=937.8000000000001s)]
*  help women when they have, when their lives are in danger and that they need medical care. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=941.7800000000001s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=949.6600000000001s)]
*  Not only because we've seen it happen, as you just described, but the prospect that [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=951.5400000000001s)]
*  health care providers will see a woman in extremis who has naturally miscarried or who [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=956.58s)]
*  has taken medication abortion. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=961.82s)]
*  For some reason, she has a complication that could hurt her and could kill her and they'll [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=963.5s)]
*  stand by because they're afraid themselves of being prosecuted. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=967.0600000000001s)]
*  Are there any sort of lessons learned that you can convey to us as a country where abortion [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=970.72s)]
*  is newly illegal in terms of just the most effective organizing, the most potent work [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=976.08s)]
*  who support abortion rights can do to try to save women's lives? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=983.1800000000001s)]
*  I think at this moment, what people in the U.S. can do is that they make sure that they [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=987.94s)]
*  have the abortion pills at home for when they need it or when a friend needs it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=992.86s)]
*  So everybody should just get the abortion pills as much as they can so that it's everywhere. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=998.0600000000001s)]
*  And that makes it more easier also for women when they need it to get it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=1003.46s)]
*  Dr. Rebecca Gompertz, thank you so much for your time and your insight tonight. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=1009.9399999999999s)]

*  It's been nearly four and a half months since WNBA star, two-time Olympic gold medalist [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=1027.66s)]
*  Brittany Greiner was arrested in Russia. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=1042.22s)]
*  She was arrested at a Moscow airport in February, just a week before Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=1044.38s)]
*  The ridiculous charge for which she was arrested that Russian officials say they found traces [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=1050.94s)]
*  of cannabis oil in empty vape cartridges in her luggage. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=1056.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=1062.38s)]
*  They have laid patently ridiculous charges against her of large-scale drug trafficking [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=1063.74s)]
*  for that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_4L6eoDKVg&t=1068.98s)]
