# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 5
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs)
*  Joining us now is NBC News justice reporter Ryan Riley who first broke the news that Ivanka Trump would be testifying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=0.0s)]
*  Before the January 6th investigation today Ryan good to see you [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Tell me what you make of the idea that Ivanka Trump [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=10.56s)]
*  According to Benny Thompson who has no reason to lie to us about this is neither invoking executive privilege [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Nor the Fifth Amendment. Do you make anything of that? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=19.72s)]
*  You know, I think it fits into this broader theme that we saw throughout the Trump administration where Ivanka Trump and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=24.0s)]
*  Jared Kushner tried to make themselves out to be the reasonable people in the room and they kept saying that they were trying to push [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=29.639999999999997s)]
*  Trump in the right direction [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=35.48s)]
*  It became a trope throughout the Trump administration where we saw this in every decision that the Trump administration [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=36.44s)]
*  Made that was unpopular with the broader masses or may have been unpopular in their circles [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=42.04s)]
*  There was always this story that said well, you know, Ivanka was trying to push him in the right direction behind the scenes [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=46.72s)]
*  So this sort of seems like an ongoing theme here because January 6 is now this monumental event that is shaping the entire Trump [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Presidency, I think it's clear here that she recognizes that she has to make clear that you know [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=59.44s)]
*  She was the reasonable voice in the room and she has to get that narrative out there or else [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=64.44s)]
*  It's gonna bring her entire brand down along with her father's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=68.08s)]
*  So I tell me how she does that without throwing him under the bus because the argument that I'm the adult in the room means [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=73.84s)]
*  That someone else wasn't being an adult in the room and the the binary [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=79.88s)]
*  Observation that would be that maybe Ivanka Trump was trying to get him to call it off and Donald Trump wasn't calling it off [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=84.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's difficult to imagine that Ivanka Trump actually believed the things about the stolen election that her father believed, right? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=91.0s)]
*  I mean just generationally she's younger. She's more internet savvy. She's college educated, you know [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=97.64s)]
*  She's probably a lot less conservative than her father [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=102.92s)]
*  So it's tough to imagine that we're in a situation here where she actually believed these lies that the president was spreading which is what makes her [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=106.48s)]
*  Testimony so so important because a critical thing here is whether or not Donald Trump actually believed [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=113.14s)]
*  The lies that he was telling about the stolen election [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=119.06s)]
*  That's really a critical component of this especially for the Justice Department investigation where that's going to be a critical component to broader [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=121.14s)]
*  To the broader investigation and criminal culpability ultimately if he actually believed the lies about the stolen election [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=129.34s)]
*  That's a lot different from just saying these things to try to make a splash and change the direction [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=135.66s)]
*  Of the and basically essentially steal the election if he knew they were lies [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=141.5s)]
*  That's one thing if he actually believed the lies that's another that could determine the trajectory of the criminal side of this investigation [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=145.38s)]
*  Joining us now is the Democratic Colorado congressman Jason Crowe member of both the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=153.46s)]
*  He has served as an army ranger in both Iraq and Afghanistan congressman. Thank you for your time tonight [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=159.66s)]
*  Thank you for joining us [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=165.5s)]
*  We just learned that the Biden administration will send another [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  100 million dollars worth of these very effective javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=170.1s)]
*  But our first guest tonight the member of parliament Alex Gonsherenko told me that Russian long-range attacks on [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=175.06s)]
*  These civilian populations are the reasons why Ukraine so desperately needs anti-tank anti-aircraft [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=181.74s)]
*  Defense more than anti-tank defense. You've also made that argument. Is the US going to do it? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=189.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think the United States is gonna do it. I'm gonna make something really clear that Biden administration has done a remarkable job [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=196.62s)]
*  providing a vast array of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=202.62s)]
*  defensive weapons and material and equipment to the Ukrainians in a very short period of time and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=205.22s)]
*  There's a couple of reasons why the Ukrainians are having as much success on the battlefield [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=210.1s)]
*  That they are one is that they are fierce fighters and they're fighting for their life and their independence and their freedom [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=214.46s)]
*  They're doing a great job [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=220.78s)]
*  The second is we're giving them tremendous weapons 21st century weapons [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  We're doing so at a breakneck pace and the third is we've been training them since 2014 [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  Giving them communications equipment in the training to actually bring them to the battlefield and allow them to fight the way they are now [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=232.54s)]
*  So the administration has done a great job [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  But wars change wars evolve in this war has changed and evolved the Russians have adapted they're shifting their tactics [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=241.61999999999998s)]
*  They're shifting their location. So our support has to adapt and evolve with it. That's what this letter is about [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=249.78s)]
*  This is not a critical letter. We're not saying they haven't done enough [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=255.3s)]
*  we're saying that the next phase of this war will require an evolution a [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=258.26s)]
*  Change in both the quantity and the speed and the nature of the support to be provided [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=262.54s)]
*  Congressman you're an army ranger you served in Afghanistan and Iraq so, you know the consequences of this [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=269.3s)]
*  How do you balance the the Ukrainian request for more assistance some of which particularly with air defenses [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=275.56s)]
*  Russia will take to be an act of war from NATO [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  How do you separate those things because people warn that if you do that you end up in World War three you end up in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=288.2s)]
*  A direct war with Russia a hot war that that then could involve nuclear weapons. Tell me how you think about this [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=293.52s)]
*  Yeah, so how I think about it is we're not going to implement a no-fly zone [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  Because that would require a US fighter jets shooting down Russian fighter jets over the Ukrainian skies [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=304.32s)]
*  And we're not going to send NATO or US troops to fight on the ground in Russia [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  So short of those things there are many many other things we can do we can pretty much provide most things that they're asking for [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=313.36s)]
*  Over some period of time. We don't do it all right now because we have they have to have the logistics [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  They have to be able to sustain it [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=324.36s)]
*  They have to be able to have the supply lines [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=325.6s)]
*  They have to be able to be trained on those systems with and make sure that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=327.48s)]
*  These are systems that won't fall into the hands of the Russians or be captured either [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=330.44s)]
*  So we're balancing all those considerations, but most of the things we can give them [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=334.46s)]
*  I think over some period of time now they have provided a list the United States government a list of 17 items [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=338.0s)]
*  prioritized in order 1 through 17 [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=343.96s)]
*  The top items in that list are things that they need and can implement right now [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=346.92s)]
*  They can put into effect on the battlefield today as you go down that list [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=351.12s)]
*  This is longer term things fighter jets tanks other material that requires some sustainment [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  Some supply lines some training that maybe they don't have but the administration has recognized what's happening here [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=362.44s)]
*  If the Ukrainians have to both fight the fight now [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  And they have to transition to a longer term fight as the Russians dig in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=372.0s)]
*  And look at kind of a war of attrition over a long period of time [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=376.76s)]
*  So we have to do both the Ukrainians understand that and our our aid has to build a balance both the short term in the long term [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=379.8s)]
*  It's hard to think about a long term when you see the images that we've all watched this weekend of these atrocities [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=389.6s)]
*  but we appreciate that people like you with real experience on the battlefield and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=395.0s)]
*  In in government understand how to discuss them Democratic, Colorado congressman [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=399.6s)]
*  Jason Crowe is a member of both the Armed Services and the Intelligence Committee sir. We thank appreciate you joining us. Thank you [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=403.74s)]
*  Joining us now is Isabelle Khurshudian a Washington Post foreign correspondent [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=410.2s)]
*  Who's been reporting from Ukraine for the past two and a half months Isabelle? It's good to see you again [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=413.76s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. We just quoted from your reporting on the bombing of that hospital in Mikhail I have I [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=418.24s)]
*  I needed to tell us more about this tell us about the patients and the medical staff and how they're able to cope in this type of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=426.04s)]
*  Environment which is unfortunately as you were reporting becoming common across this country [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=432.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think what you know really strikes me now when you go to the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=436.16s)]
*  Site of some of these bombings and attacks is just right away people have this kind of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=440.32s)]
*  You know numbness as they just start to clean up the scene. I mean when we got there people, you know [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=446.32s)]
*  Volunteers and hospital staff were just sweeping up glass. I mean sweeping up [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=451.76000000000005s)]
*  Areas that had been their offices their wards [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  Things of that sort. So I think [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=460.12s)]
*  These attacks happen they expect them at this point and right away they start to clean up, but I mean [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=462.16s)]
*  That hospital got lucky that everyone was evacuated in time and you know, no one was seriously injured [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=468.56s)]
*  But one woman, you know, she had come to the hospital with a heart condition, you know, I even said to her [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=474.16s)]
*  I can't imagine this was good for your heart. You know the stress of this [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=479.52s)]
*  I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=484.44s)]
*  This [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=490.64s)]
*  And she said, you know, I'm too scared to stay here at the hospital [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=491.84s)]
*  I'd rather go home and that's where you know that becomes really heartbreaking is that even a hospital becomes, you know unsafe [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=495.64s)]
*  It's a place that you know Ukrainians now expect to be targeted and you know, they're afraid to be there even if it's you know [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=502.55999999999995s)]
*  They need to be there for their health [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  There's something in your reporting was very similar to what Richard Engel had from Buccia [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=512.56s)]
*  You reported on the experiences of Ukrainian residents living in the villages around Mikhailov where Russians were and they they'd been [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=517.24s)]
*  Asking them where the Nazis live and I don't know whether this is something they're really trying to get at or whether this is part [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=525.6s)]
*  of the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=531.64s)]
*  Propaganda that these these soldiers were given when they invaded Ukraine, but they're going around looking for Nazis they say [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, everyone we talked to said the Russians were asking where the Nazis [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=541.2800000000001s)]
*  Where are the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=547.4000000000001s)]
*  Bandera rights, you know, which was a group that was a Ukrainian national group that was formed in World War two [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=549.12s)]
*  They were looking for people dressed in black [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=555.5600000000001s)]
*  And you know a lot of residents that we talked to in these areas, you know [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=558.36s)]
*  These are small towns and villages, you know about an hour northeast of Mikhailov that were occupied for about ten days [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=562.58s)]
*  You know those people kind of looked at them at the Russian soldiers and said we have no people like that here [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=570.24s)]
*  We don't know what you're talking about [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=576.6s)]
*  And their impression was that you know, those soldiers had been kind of you know, almost brainwashed by [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=579.84s)]
*  This Kremlin false propaganda that's been used to justify, you know this unprovoked war [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=586.96s)]
*  The Russian troops are trying to make their way west along southern [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=594.6800000000001s)]
*  Ukraine and Mikhailov has been a point at which they've been stopped it [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=599.24s)]
*  They were planning to otherwise be in Odessa the beautiful port city of Odessa the biggest port in the country on the Black Sea [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=603.0s)]
*  You have spent a lot of time reporting on Odessa and it's it's where your parents were born [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=610.6s)]
*  Tell us what it's like what it was like to be there and and how that port city is doing right now [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=615.6s)]
*  Everybody there is expecting that the worst is still yet yet to come [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=620.58s)]
*  Yeah, Odessa is you know [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=627.2800000000001s)]
*  For the most part life there has returned to normal for you know normal ish I guess as normal as things can get in a war [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=630.26s)]
*  there are [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=638.0999999999999s)]
*  You know still military checkpoints and a heavy military presence, but even the zoo is open nowadays [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=639.54s)]
*  You know salons are open restaurants are open but at the same time people know that that's the prize for Russia, right and there were [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=645.86s)]
*  You know air strikes recently on the fuel depots there [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=654.4599999999999s)]
*  I think people are nervous. I think they're kind of scared as this war appears to be shifting east and south [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=657.86s)]
*  And now we're seeing Mikhailov come under much heavier, you know attacks [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=665.34s)]
*  I think there's kind of a push that people in Mikhailov are starting to feel [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=669.98s)]
*  Where we're seeing more cluster munitions more attacks in broad daylight [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=677.02s)]
*  That seemed to be kind of purposely targeting civilians and so those people end up evacuating to Odessa and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=681.5s)]
*  You know as you mentioned I have family there my family is from there my great-aunt is there and I remember the morning of those [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=688.94s)]
*  airstrikes [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=695.62s)]
*  On the fuel depots my great-aunt was like maybe you should leave [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=697.26s)]
*  And you know obviously that's not really how my job works. My job is to stay and you know document what happens, but [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=701.22s)]
*  It's a weird feeling there because on the surface it looks very normal, but people are getting nervous as [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=708.9799999999999s)]
*  Kind of it seems that that area is going to come into play soon [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=716.54s)]
*  It is it's not just very hard [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=723.14s)]
*  It's impossible to put your feelings aside as a journalist when you're covering a story like this [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=724.6999999999999s)]
*  But when you have your heart in it because your family is actually there [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=728.54s)]
*  That is a hell of a challenge and we thank you for for living up to it and doing it [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=732.74s)]
*  Isabel Kershudyan is a Washington Post foreign correspondent, and we thank you for your time tonight [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=737.02s)]
*  Joining us now from the southern city of Chernihivsky is Alex Goncharenko [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=743.1800000000001s)]
*  He's a member of the Ukrainian Parliament Alex. Thank you for being with us [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=747.5s)]
*  We were together on Saturday when you had first reached that area in in Buccia [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=751.34s)]
*  And you were you had your phone and you were showing me a shopping mall behind you that had been destroyed [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=756.1s)]
*  But at that point in the middle of the day on Saturday [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=761.62s)]
*  Neither you nor I had first seen what you ended up having to experience the the bodies and the the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=764.4599999999999s)]
*  the sheer destruction throughout the region [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=772.38s)]
*  That's true it was [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=777.02s)]
*  That we explored just during last days and what we saw is awful absolutely [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=779.5799999999999s)]
*  horrific [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=786.5799999999999s)]
*  picture of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=788.0999999999999s)]
*  devastation and murders [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=789.62s)]
*  Committed by Russian army and I can tell you me personally I saw up to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=791.66s)]
*  50 killed people [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=797.94s)]
*  50 just imagine I saw mass grave with up to 20 bodies in black plastic bags [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=800.18s)]
*  I saw these dozens of burned down cars that you are now showing I [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=806.26s)]
*  Saw one what is absolutely awful on these key of the toner outer route [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=810.98s)]
*  I saw naked bodies of women and their clothes were near the road [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=817.74s)]
*  So which we can only just understand what had happened probably before their death [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=822.94s)]
*  But after Russian troops killed them they put them on tires and tried to burn them down and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=828.58s)]
*  Partly they succeeded and partly not it's so awful that I can't just explain you and I said [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=836.7800000000001s)]
*  Just explain you and I saw it by my own eyes [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=844.9s)]
*  I met a couple of aged people who saw by their own eyes like Russians killed [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=849.02s)]
*  People in the car just outside of their house and then they took their bodies and burned them in their private garden [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=854.82s)]
*  So now they have a vegetables there some flowers and two graves of people whom they even didn't know [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=861.78s)]
*  Alex you've actually been traveling from town to town [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=868.5s)]
*  This is one of the things that you do in addition to the other things you do as a member of parliament and a charity you run [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=871.7800000000001s)]
*  But there are so many towns and you've alluded to this on your Twitter feed [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=878.26s)]
*  That we've not seen anything about because they're either still under Russian attack or under occupation [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=882.58s)]
*  So when you're talking about her son or Mariupol, what are you hearing? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=887.62s)]
*  About Mariupol we have [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=892.4200000000001s)]
*  Testimonies of people who left Mariupol who managed and who succeeded to to leave [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=895.1400000000001s)]
*  This city and what they are saying is so horrific the city of half million population is almost completely destroyed [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=902.4200000000001s)]
*  just flattened and [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=911.5400000000001s)]
*  They're saying about if speaking about Buche or the city of Buche [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=914.1800000000001s)]
*  They're saying about if speaking about Buche or the area the number of [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=918.34s)]
*  Victims were counting them in hundreds. So in Mariupol we are counting them in thousands [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=925.06s)]
*  in thousands just in one city but quite big city but one and [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=932.66s)]
*  Really, we are scared to turn to just to open what what had happened in Mariupol [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=939.38s)]
*  Russians are still there. They're still attacking the city. It's under siege [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=946.5s)]
*  Ukrainian troops are partly controlling the city and still fighting what we do know that one of Lithuanian [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=951.0600000000001s)]
*  Director who tried to make documentary there was killed by Russian troops two days ago [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=958.42s)]
*  and [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=964.42s)]
*  That's why we don't have enough information, but even that we know [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=965.62s)]
*  Shows us the situation there is absolutely awful [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=970.1s)]
*  That is a war crimes and that is a genocide because all these people are civilians and they're killed for just being Ukrainians [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=973.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, let's let's discuss that a little bit more because [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=983.86s)]
*  You've been out there documenting it president Zelensky did say that the atrocities that he was there as well in [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=986.98s)]
*  Buccia and saw were evidence of genocide against ukraine [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=992.4200000000001s)]
*  The us has said that while it's possible that genocide is being committed. It's not ready yet to make that assessment [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=996.74s)]
*  So what do you say to those in the world who are saying we now believe these are war crimes? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1003.94s)]
*  We're not sure it's genocide the deliberate [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1008.9s)]
*  Annihilation and elimination and killing of people because of who they are [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1012.32s)]
*  Unfortunately, I think that in some time they will say yes, that's you are right [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1015.64s)]
*  Uh like like at the beginning we said that russians [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1021.0s)]
*  Will make this terror campaign and they were making it and [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1025.08s)]
*  Also, they were like, okay, maybe they are exaggerating [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1029.6399999999999s)]
*  But now watching these pictures of devastation and killings and absolutely unhuman barbaric behavior of russian troops [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1033.8799999999999s)]
*  Now, we have to think about the situation [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1038.36s)]
*  And [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1040.36s)]
*  That in some time the genocide will be proved as a genocide [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1056.28s)]
*  Also, ukraine is inviting international criminal court [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1061.8s)]
*  specialist prosecutors to ukraine to work on this and [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1065.9399999999998s)]
*  I think that after the whole work, which will be done. It will be absolutely clear that russia is committing genocide [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1070.6799999999998s)]
*  Alex as you know because everybody in ukraine has these apps about [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1080.6s)]
*  airstrikes and things and there is information from a government official not far from where you are close to the moldovan border that there have been [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1084.34s)]
*  Um strikes again tonight. What's the situation in southern ukraine where you are now? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1091.0s)]
*  You see that I know without light because it is just for beating and [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1096.44s)]
*  because it can be bombed and [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1102.6000000000001s)]
*  It's better to to not to [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1105.48s)]
*  Show light in the night because russians are continuing to bomb and missile attack [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1108.76s)]
*  uh ukrainian cities and for example just [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1115.48s)]
*  Yesterday mikolay [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1119.8000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday mikolayev the one of the southern cities of ukraine was again attacked and what what targets were [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1121.6399999999999s)]
*  the oncological hospital and pediatric hospital [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1129.1599999999999s)]
*  Just just imagine so again, it's not a military target and russians are continuing this terror campaign [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1133.6399999999999s)]
*  Throughout the whole country. That's why we so desperately need air defense and aircraft [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1141.3999999999999s)]
*  We succeeded to win the battle at kiev which is extremely important strategically important [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1148.3s)]
*  And uh, we're going we want to go further [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1154.78s)]
*  But what is our problem the air where russians still have advantage and we hope that with the help of the free world [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1157.9s)]
*  Which is shocked with all these pictures and this horror we will succeed to change the situation in air, too [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1165.66s)]
*  Thank you [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZskg8GAwLs&t=1174.46s)]
