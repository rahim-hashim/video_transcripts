# Fresh from scandal over group chat attack plans, Hegseth's conduct opens him to ridicule
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk)
*  The signal group texting about war plants, that scandal is also continuing to blow up, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=0.0s)]
*  even though they keep trying to pretend either it didn't happen or it's over now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=5.44s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reporting this weekend that this apparently was not the first time [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=9.4s)]
*  that Trump National Security Advisor Michael Walz had convened a group of Trump cabinet [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=13.6s)]
*  officials in a group chat on this commercial texting app. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=19.14s)]
*  Quoting from the Wall Street Journal this weekend, quote, two U.S. officials also said [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=24.76s)]
*  that Walz had created and hosted multiple other sensitive national security conversations [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=28.36s)]
*  on signal with cabinet members, including separate threads on brokering peace between [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=33.4s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine, as well as other military operations. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=38.32s)]
*  Sources, quote, declined to address if any classified information was posted in those [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=44.92s)]
*  chats. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=48.92s)]
*  So, yeah, this thing isn't going away. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=49.92s)]
*  Wait till we find out what all the other ones were. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=53.36s)]
*  And then there's Pete Hegsath, the Fox News weekend host who Donald Trump appointed to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=56.08s)]
*  lead the Defense Department. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=60.64s)]
*  In recent days, we have learned that Pete Hegsath not only posted a detailed timeline [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=62.339999999999996s)]
*  of a forthcoming military strike to that group chat on signal, which inadvertently included [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=67.36s)]
*  a reporter. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=72.52s)]
*  Pete Hegsath also, according to the Wall Street Journal, quote, brought his wife, a former [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=74.0s)]
*  Fox News producer, to two meetings with foreign military counterparts where sensitive information [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=80.12s)]
*  was discussed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=85.86s)]
*  The meetings included the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO, a closed-door meeting [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=87.5s)]
*  of that group, more than 50 countries represented there, and also a very sensitive meeting with [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=92.9s)]
*  the British Defense Secretary. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=98.26s)]
*  Pete Hegsath has been bringing his wife to these meetings. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=100.42s)]
*  Does she have a security clearance? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=104.3s)]
*  This is the same wife, you may recall, who Mr. Hegsath brought with him to his meetings [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  with U.S. senators ahead of his confirmation process for this job. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  That, of course, made it socially awkward for those senators to ask him at those meetings [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=115.62s)]
*  about the rape allegations that he had faced in California and his alleged serial infidelity [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=119.98s)]
*  and problems with drinking on the job. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  He has denied the rape allegations in California, and of course, he was never charged in conjunction [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=129.9s)]
*  with those allegations. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=134.18s)]
*  That said, the Associated Press is also now reporting on the strange circumstance that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=136.34s)]
*  has arisen at the Pentagon in Mr. Hegsath's short time there, in which not only is he [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=140.52s)]
*  bringing his wife to sensitive meetings with foreign military leaders, but he's also somehow [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=145.94s)]
*  got himself into a situation where his baby brother, his younger brother, Phil, has also [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=152.86s)]
*  ended up on the plane to Guantanamo with Pete Hegsath and also on the plane last week to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=159.96s)]
*  Hawaii. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=166.52s)]
*  What is his little brother doing there? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=168.66s)]
*  Good question. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=171.14s)]
*  Quote, based on Phil Hegsath's publicly available resume, his past experience includes founding [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=172.14s)]
*  his own podcast production company. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=178.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=182.5s)]
*  So naturally it makes sense that he's now paid by the U.S. taxpayers to go everywhere [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=185.26s)]
*  with his brother, the defense secretary, who has assured us that he definitely won't drink [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=189.62s)]
*  on the job anymore and who apparently thinks it's okay to bring his wife to NATO meetings. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=194.66s)]
*  This follows Mr. Hegsath also giving a naval officer's commission to his personal lawyer [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=202.14s)]
*  and telling him that now Pete Hegsath's personal lawyer will now be in charge of reforming [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=211.9s)]
*  all lawyering in the U.S. military. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=218.26s)]
*  He's just named him an officer. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=222.74s)]
*  This of course follows Pete Hegsath's fantastically expensive and honestly strange decisions to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=226.06s)]
*  send not one but two U.S. Navy destroyers to hover around the U.S. border doing nothing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=231.0s)]
*  Also to use U.S. military planes to fly handfuls of people around the world in the most expensive [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=239.38s)]
*  possible version of how to do a deportation flight. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  The New York Times reporting tonight that Hegsath's failed gambit to stand up a U.S. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=248.58s)]
*  military role at Guantanamo specifically to make it look like Guantanamo has something [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=253.78s)]
*  to do with Trump's deportations. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=258.38s)]
*  That gambit has thus far cost taxpayers about $40 million in its first month. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=260.72s)]
*  Now this whole Guantanamo thing is a plan that has essentially been scrapped now. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=269.04s)]
*  But only after Pete Hegsath moved nearly a thousand U.S. troops there and then back [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=274.22s)]
*  and had them sent up a tent city and then kind of dismantled it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=279.98s)]
*  Because these guys, don't forget, government efficiency, can't allow old people to call [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=285.1s)]
*  the Social Security Office anymore. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  But hey, we got to save money. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=293.18s)]
*  Pete Hegsath needs to fuel up the C-17s to fly like five guys around so they can make [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=295.5s)]
*  TikTok videos about how tough they are. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=301.18s)]
*  See my tattoos? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=303.22s)]
*  Tomorrow Pete Hegsath in his infinite wisdom has decided to visit the Naval Academy in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=306.02000000000004s)]
*  Annapolis, Maryland. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=310.74s)]
*  We don't know if he'll bring his little brother or his wife, but we'll see. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=311.74s)]
*  Per his orders, the U.S. Naval Academy is apparently scrambling to get books out of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=316.98s)]
*  the library before he gets there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=323.38000000000005s)]
*  Books like a biography of Jackie Robinson. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=325.82000000000005s)]
*  That's got to be out of there, I guess, before Pete Hegsath gets to the Naval Academy because [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=329.94s)]
*  it so offends him. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=333.82s)]
*  Because you know he's really focused on lethality. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=335.9s)]
*  Where's my brother? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=341.14s)]
*  Can my wife sit behind me at the meeting with the defense secretary from the other country? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-cbk9v4EVk&t=342.14s)]
