# 'The Republican Party is going through some things': Maddow marvels at GOP veering into extremism
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A)
*  Here is the serving Republican Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina on that movie, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=0.0s)]
*  on Black Panther. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=5.94s)]
*  He says it is, quote, created by an agnostic Jew and put to film by a Satanic Marxist. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=8.26s)]
*  He calls it, quote, this trash that was only created to pull the shekels out of your schwarze [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=16.5s)]
*  pockets. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=22.18s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=25.18s)]
*  Tomorrow on Super Tuesday, he's actually going to be running in the North Carolina [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=29.32s)]
*  primary to try to become his party's nominee for governor of the great state of North Carolina. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=32.5s)]
*  Here he is calling survivors of school gun massacres, quote, media prostitutes, as in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=39.379999999999995s)]
*  prostitutes but prostitutes. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=46.739999999999995s)]
*  He calls them spoiled little bastards who need to shut up. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  Again, this is for kids who lived through a school shooting that killed 17 of their [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=53.04s)]
*  classmates. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=57.98s)]
*  They need to shut up. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=58.98s)]
*  He calls public school teachers, quote, wicked people. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=61.81999999999999s)]
*  And not for nothing, he says this about the Holocaust. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=66.02s)]
*  He says, quote, Hitler disarming millions of Jews and then marching them off to concentration [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=68.82s)]
*  camps is a bunch of hogwash. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=73.5s)]
*  He is the Republican Party's leading candidate to be their party's nominee for governor [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=78.19999999999999s)]
*  of the state of North Carolina. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=83.92s)]
*  He will be on the ballot tomorrow in that state. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=86.38s)]
*  He's already lieutenant governor in North Carolina. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=88.06s)]
*  On Friday in Florida, Republicans in that state legislature passed yet another new law [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  to restrict any teaching about racism in the United States. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=99.38s)]
*  This happened just this past Friday, just a couple days ago in Florida. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  And in the debate over this new Florida bill, one Republican Florida state representative [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=108.3s)]
*  said that while this bill overall will restrict teaching about racism and things like slavery [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=113.22s)]
*  in Florida, he said there is one specific thing that he wanted to make sure is included [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=118.58s)]
*  in public education in Florida from here on out. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=124.1s)]
*  He said while he supports this bill, he does want to make sure everybody's aware that slaves [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=127.04s)]
*  were, quote, paid for their work. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=132.14s)]
*  And so he wants to make sure that's taught in schools. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=135.72s)]
*  And then he voted for the bill. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=140.06s)]
*  This, of course, comes in Florida after the state's Republican governor tried to claim [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=142.16s)]
*  during his presidential campaign that there were actually a lot of underappreciated benefits [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=145.7s)]
*  of slavery for the people who were enslaved. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  The chair of the Florida Democratic Party put out a statement in response, clearly just [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  mystified, saying, quote, Florida Republicans are hell bent on teaching our children that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  slavery wasn't bad. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=163.4s)]
*  And it is hard to argue. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=166.6s)]
*  I know it's insane, but it keeps happening. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=169.76s)]
*  Pop over to Oklahoma. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=173.76s)]
*  In Oklahoma, Republicans control the state government there, too. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=175.48s)]
*  And like just about everywhere, that's true. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=178.68s)]
*  Oklahoma Republicans have now banned abortion in almost every circumstance. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=182.44s)]
*  But that apparently is not enough for them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=186.72s)]
*  Oklahoma Republicans are now moving a new bill that would create a state registry of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=188.68s)]
*  every woman who does still find a way to get an abortion. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  I wonder what Oklahoma Republicans will want to do with a state database of women who [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=198.96s)]
*  have undergone abortions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=203.84s)]
*  I'm sure they want it for only the most respectful and responsible reasons. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=206.8s)]
*  Other lawmakers are warning that the way the Oklahoma bill is written, it looks like it's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=213.0s)]
*  also, in addition to creating a registry of women who have had abortions, it also seems [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  intended to ban contraception, including forms of contraception like the IUD. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=222.66s)]
*  That's what Oklahoma Republicans are up to. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=228.84s)]
*  In Alabama, you may remember the nine Republican justices on the Alabama Supreme Court issued [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=232.32s)]
*  a unanimous ruling that effectively outlawed fertility treatment in that state. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  After Alabama's Supreme Court Republicans did that, Democrats in Congress in Washington [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=243.12s)]
*  introduced federal legislation to protect fertility treatment and protect IVF. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=248.24s)]
*  That legislation was blocked by Republican U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  There are 219 Republicans in Congress right now in the House. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=260.12s)]
*  There's 219. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=263.96s)]
*  Of that 219 number of Republicans, 125 of them are co-sponsors of legislation that would [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  ban IVF and arguably many popular forms of contraception as well. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=272.36s)]
*  125 House Republicans, more than half the Republicans in the House, co-sponsored that, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=278.44s)]
*  including the Republican Speaker of the House. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=284.04s)]
*  125 of them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=287.4s)]
*  195 of them voted against contraception. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=288.68s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=291.64s)]
*  The Right to Contraception Act was introduced by Democrats after the Republican appointees [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=292.64s)]
*  on the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=297.0s)]
*  The right to contraception. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=300.88s)]
*  Only eight Republicans in Congress voted for that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=303.04s)]
*  195 voted against. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=306.36s)]
*  And let's just stick with healthcare just for a second. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=310.44s)]
*  Florida again. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=312.48s)]
*  Florida, they are now contending with a super worrying outbreak of measles. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=313.48s)]
*  Measles, like it's the 1800s or something. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=317.16s)]
*  One of the most transmissible pathogens on earth. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=319.92s)]
*  And one we don't typically have to worry about anymore in this country because for 60 freaking [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  years we've had a totally effective vaccine against measles. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  In Florida, Republicans picked a very special state surgeon general who's now telling Florida [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=332.56s)]
*  parents, oh, who am I to suggest that perhaps kids should be vaccinated against measles? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=337.6s)]
*  Beyond who am I to say your kids should be vaccinated, the hand-picked, hand-Republican-picked [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=363.16s)]
*  Florida surgeon general wouldn't even say that kids with measles should stay home from [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=370.24s)]
*  school while they're infectious and symptomatic with one of the most transmissible potentially [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=374.92s)]
*  fatal pathogens known to mankind. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=380.48s)]
*  Measles in Florida. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=383.8s)]
*  Not to be outdone, now the Republican Party's leading presidential candidate is saying on [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=385.8s)]
*  that he will withhold funding, withhold all funding, not a penny, from any school anywhere [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=390.4s)]
*  in America if kids have to be vaccinated to come to school. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=395.56s)]
*  Kids have to be vaccinated all over the country, everywhere, against measles and mumps and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=400.64s)]
*  polio. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=406.56s)]
*  I mean, it's been true for decades. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=407.56s)]
*  It's been true for generations. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=409.56s)]
*  But just in case you've been missing, I don't know, iron lungs, the Republican Party is [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=411.46s)]
*  raring to go this election year with a new Measles and Polio for All the Kids Plan. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=415.72s)]
*  And what swing state busy mom and dad isn't going to want to get the whole family to lick [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  that doorknob and vote GOP this November with that kind of platform on offer to the American [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=426.68s)]
*  people? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=430.76000000000005s)]
*  Can we get a smallpox over here? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=431.76000000000005s)]
*  How about some tetanus for the little ones? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=432.76000000000005s)]
*  Whooping cough like it's going out of style. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  I do want to give the Missouri Republican Party a little bit of a shout out, though, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=439.36s)]
*  a little salute, a little stiff-armed salute, perhaps. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=443.48s)]
*  This gentleman, not the one in the Klan robe with a sheet over his head, but the guy next [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=447.32000000000005s)]
*  to him. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=453.56s)]
*  And you can see him also in this photo. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=455.44s)]
*  He is not the guy with the full Klan neo-Nazi uniform on with the tie on the right. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  No, he's the guy next to him. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=462.84000000000003s)]
*  You can see if you put the images next to each other, he's got the same little thing [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=465.36s)]
*  both images, the glasses around his neck on those like croquis style things. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=469.12s)]
*  Yeah, so that guy, the one who with the burning cross behind him is making the Roman salute [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=473.04s)]
*  with the Klansman and then in the other photo with the neo-Nazi uniform guy in front of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=479.2s)]
*  the neo-Nazi flag. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  He is running for the Republican nomination for governor of the great state of Missouri. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=484.64s)]
*  And I said I wanted to shout out the Missouri Republican Party here, and I do because they [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=492.14s)]
*  are now frantically trying to remove him from the ballot. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=495.8s)]
*  So the neo-Nazi Klan guy can't be their Republican nominee for governor. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=499.44s)]
*  Once they announced that they were trying to get him off the ballot, he responded this [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=505.6s)]
*  weekend saying, quote, the GOP knew exactly who I am. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  Republicans in Missouri, including the Missouri secretary of state, are trying to get him [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=515.44s)]
*  off the ballot now fast while also trying to explain away what appeared to be themselves [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV51sWQ9s3A&t=519.34s)]
