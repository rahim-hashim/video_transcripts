# As Trump Worked Presidency's Power To Seize Voting Machines, Local Backers Got The Message
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI)
*  All these latest revelations about the plot to overthrow the election, the stuff about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=0.0s)]
*  taking the voting machines, taking the election machinery, it keeps coming up. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=3.88s)]
*  And again, this is one of those things like the fake slates of electors that they forged. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=9.72s)]
*  It's one of those things that seems random, right? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=13.52s)]
*  It seems like a bizarre world, sort of inexplicable sidebar to the overall plot. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=16.6s)]
*  But apparently they were really fixated on it and they worked really hard on it from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=21.52s)]
*  like five different angles in ways that are only now starting to become clear. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=25.44s)]
*  Last week it was Politico.com that was first to obtain this executive order, apparently [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  prepared for Trump, that would have authorized the military to go around the country seizing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=33.92s)]
*  voting machines. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=38.24s)]
*  CNN then reported that it wasn't just the military that was the target of this draft [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=39.24s)]
*  executive order. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=43.2s)]
*  There was another one, a similar one, that laid out essentially the same scheme but would [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=44.2s)]
*  have authorized the Homeland Security Department to seize the voting machines instead of the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=47.8s)]
*  military. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=51.28s)]
*  Then the New York Times newly reported this week that Trump personally directed his lawyer, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=52.6s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani, to call the Homeland Security Department to try to get the scheme enacted, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=56.92s)]
*  to ask that Homeland Security orchestrate the seizing of voting machines and election [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  machines in multiple states. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  So we know this wasn't some out of left field, freelance, harebrained idea presented to Trump [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=68.32s)]
*  that he never considered or that he rejected. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  We know from New York Times reporting that Trump actually told somebody to call Homeland [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=77.1s)]
*  Security and get this done. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=80.88s)]
*  The Times also reports that Trump made the ask personally to a different federal department. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=83.0s)]
*  In an Oval Office meeting per the New York Times this week, Trump asked Attorney General [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  William Barr to have the U.S. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Justice Department go out, fan out all over the country and go seize voting machines, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  go seize elections equipment. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=99.12s)]
*  But even that wasn't the extent of it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=101.96s)]
*  There was more. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  And it was reported widely and publicly at the time that President Trump was inviting [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  a whole delegation of Republican lawmakers from Michigan to come to the Oval Office and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=110.6s)]
*  meet with him personally in the White House. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=115.0s)]
*  This was happening while he was publicly invading against the Michigan election results and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=117.3s)]
*  insisting he must have won that state and it all must have been stolen from him. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=121.28s)]
*  Again, this was November 20th. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  It's totally clear what was going on, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=127.24s)]
*  This is right after the election. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=128.92s)]
*  It's two and a half weeks after the election. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  Trump was not only disputing Biden's victory in Michigan at the time, he was publicly trying [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=132.48s)]
*  to pressure local election officials in Michigan counties that went for Biden that they shouldn't [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=136.2s)]
*  certify the election results in those counties. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=140.48s)]
*  It was widely speculated at the time that he had invited those Republican lawmakers [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=142.76s)]
*  from Michigan to rope them in on this scheme he was pushing to overthrow the government, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  to pressure them to go back home to Michigan and somehow use their authority as state lawmakers [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=151.56s)]
*  to undo the Biden victory in the state of Michigan. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=156.16s)]
*  Those lawmakers spent nearly two hours with Trump inside the White House that day. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  The Detroit News reported at the time that they were all in quote that they were all [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=163.44s)]
*  They were all quote laughing and in good spirits when they left after their meeting with the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=167.28s)]
*  president. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=171.6s)]
*  Democratic activists actually projected photos of the Michigan Republican leaders who had [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=172.6s)]
*  met with Trump that day. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=177.68s)]
*  While the president is actively and publicly trying to overthrow the election results in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=179.68s)]
*  Michigan, they projected their photos on the outside of the Trump hotel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  Well after their White House meeting, those two Republican leaders who had their faces [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=188.24s)]
*  projected in the outside of the hotel, they put out a statement saying they had no information [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=192.88s)]
*  that would change the outcome of the election. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  They never really said what happened in that meeting. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  Same goes for a near identical meeting that Trump held with Republican lawmakers from [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=204.04000000000002s)]
*  Pennsylvania around the same time, five days later. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=209.0s)]
*  He brought a group of Pennsylvania Republicans to D.C. just in late December, excuse me, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=211.0s)]
*  in late November as well. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=217.0s)]
*  Now, you might remember earlier this week, the New York Times reported when they were [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=219.0s)]
*  reporting on the seize the voting machines plans. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  They reported that not only had Trump entertained and advanced these plans to have Homeland [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  Security or the U.S. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Justice Department go out and seize the voting machines, the Times also reported that he had [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  personally tried to persuade state lawmakers from Michigan and Pennsylvania that they should [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  use local law enforcement agencies to take control of voting machines in their states. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, we spoke with the New York Times reporters who broke that story this week. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  And they gave us this, I think, important clarification. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=252.52s)]
*  They told us that their sources confirmed to them that, in fact, that's what those Oval [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=254.52s)]
*  Office meetings were about. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  That Trump did discuss this idea of seizing the voting machines in Michigan and seizing [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=262.52000000000004s)]
*  the voting machines in Pennsylvania during those two separate Oval Office meetings with [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  Michigan and Pennsylvania lawmakers in November 2020. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=274.52000000000004s)]
*  This was a federally driven plot, right? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  Effort to get the voting machines to work. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  And it was a federally driven plot, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=280.68s)]
*  Efforts enacted and directed personally by the president himself that those voting machines [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=282.68s)]
*  in swing states had to be seized. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=286.68s)]
*  It does not appear that those efforts by, including President Trump personally, doesn't [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=288.68s)]
*  appear that those efforts succeeded. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=294.68s)]
*  But here's the thing about a criminal conspiracy. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=296.68s)]
*  For a conspiracy to work, it does not necessarily have to be the people who you directly told [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=300.68s)]
*  to do it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=306.68s)]
*  If you make it clear enough that you want it done, in this case, if you make it clear [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  enough that you want those voting machines seized, you want them physically taken, if [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  you make it clear enough, well, you know, hey, anybody can join in on your conspiracy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  This is a piece of this puzzle that is worth scrutiny. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  Thanks to an email obtained by a nonprofit news organization called Bridge Michigan, we [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  know there was at least one person in local law enforcement in Michigan who tried to carry [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=335.0s)]
*  out or who seems to have been trying to carry out Trump's scheme that the voting machines [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=341.0s)]
*  needed to be seized. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=347.0s)]
*  The lawyer for the sheriff of Berry County, Michigan wrote to Sidney Powell, quote, My [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=349.0s)]
*  client, the Berry County sheriff, called me and I instructed him to put the machines and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=353.0s)]
*  the ballots in the evidence room. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=358.0s)]
*  He's done that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=360.0s)]
*  We're trying to get the same thing to happen next county over in Kalamazoo. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=362.16s)]
*  I don't know if we can get the sheriff in Kalamazoo to seize voting machines and ballots [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=366.16s)]
*  in that county, but if we could, a comparison of the machines could yield some potential [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=370.16s)]
*  forensics. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=374.16s)]
*  Attaching the unofficial results tabulation for Berry County. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=376.16s)]
*  Again, my client has apparently taken all the machines and ballots into evidence. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=378.16s)]
*  The local sheriff has taken all the ballots and all the machines into evidence? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=386.16s)]
*  He has? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=390.32000000000005s)]
*  Somebody actually tried it? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=392.32000000000005s)]
*  The attorney for that sheriff put it in writing, put it in an email to Sidney Powell that they [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  had done that in Berry County, Michigan. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=400.32000000000005s)]
*  We tried contacting the attorney who sent that email. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=402.32000000000005s)]
*  He won't talk to us. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=404.32000000000005s)]
*  Maybe he'll change his mind, call us back. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=406.32000000000005s)]
*  We did actually, though, manage to talk to the Berry County sheriff himself. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=408.32000000000005s)]
*  Sheriff Dar Leif is his name. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=412.32000000000005s)]
*  He told us he has no evidence of the police. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=414.32000000000005s)]
*  He told us he has no idea why his lawyer sent that email to Trump election conspiracy lawyer [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=418.48s)]
*  Sidney Powell. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=424.48s)]
*  Sheriff Leif denies that he ever seized any voting machines or that he put voting machines [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=426.48s)]
*  and ballots into the evidence room, like his lawyer says he did. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=430.48s)]
*  But Sheriff Leif did confirm that he reached out to other Michigan sheriffs in what appears [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=434.48s)]
*  to be a related scheme or at least around related ideas. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=440.48s)]
*  This is what he told us. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=444.48s)]
*  He said, quote, I made a phone call to see if there were voting incidents in their counties [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  that could justify seizing the voting machines. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=450.64000000000004s)]
*  He says he didn't find any. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  But he was making phone calls to other sheriffs trying to find a good enough reason to do [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  This story is just insane. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  It's playing out in part this week in court. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  This is one's out of a place called Cross Village Township in Michigan, which is at the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  very, very tippy top of the Mitten, if you think of the lower peninsula as the Mitten. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  In January 2021, so right after the election, a woman from Cross Village Township phoned [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=474.8s)]
*  up a guy who ran a computer technician business. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=480.8s)]
*  The woman said she was calling from something called the Election Integrity Commission, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=484.8s)]
*  and she was working to collect voting data from voting machines all across the state [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=488.8s)]
*  of Michigan. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=492.8s)]
*  She told him that she needed his help. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=494.8s)]
*  According to her, there was one voting machine in the state that she was having trouble [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=496.8s)]
*  The one in Cross Village Township, which is where she's from. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  She said the machine was not connected to the internet, so she could not access the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  data. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  She needed him to physically go to the machine, make a copy of all the data on it, and then [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  bring that data back to her before the machine was, quote, wiped clean in routine maintenance. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=514.96s)]
*  According to the local press, following this woman's instructions, that computer technician [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=520.96s)]
*  and two other men actually tried to do it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=524.96s)]
*  They showed up in mid-January 2021 to the Township Community Center where the election [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=529.12s)]
*  machine was held. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=533.12s)]
*  Two of the men were inexplicably wearing bulletproof vests. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=535.12s)]
*  One of them was carrying a gun. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=538.12s)]
*  The computer technician was brought to the room where the voting machine was being kept. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=540.12s)]
*  He said it appeared as if the door to the room where the voting machine was kept had [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=546.12s)]
*  been tampered with. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=550.12s)]
*  He then proceeded. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=552.12s)]
*  He then proceeded to remove the computer from the machine. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=554.12s)]
*  He removed the computer from inside the voting machine. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=558.28s)]
*  He says he noticed that the screws on the computer had been stripped. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=561.28s)]
*  It was then that he realized he did not have the right kind of connector to be able to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=566.28s)]
*  download the data onto his thumb drive, so he was not able to make the copy of the machine [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=570.28s)]
*  that that woman who said she was from the Election Integrity Commission wanted. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=575.28s)]
*  Here's the thing, though. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=579.28s)]
*  There's no such thing as the Election Integrity Commission. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=581.28s)]
*  This woman had no authority to send men in bulletproof vests with a gun to go manhandle [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  that voting machine in Michigan like that. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  But this actually happened. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  We know all of this because this woman has now been arrested in connection with this [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  incident on charges of common law fraud and aiding and abetting the unauthorized access [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=596.4399999999999s)]
*  of a computer. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=600.4399999999999s)]
*  She was just in court this week as her case proceeds. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  She's told authorities that the reason she sent those armed men to go get the voting [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  machine in her town is because she heard there was data on a satellite owned by the VAT [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  and that would show that there was voter fraud in the 2020 election, so she needed that data [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=612.6s)]
*  on the voting machine to prove the Vatican plot. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=617.6s)]
*  That Italy hacked the voting machine's thing, that Vatican satellite thing, that is one [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=621.6s)]
*  of the weirder conspiracies pushed by the people in Donald Trump's orbit to justify [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=628.6s)]
*  overturning the results of this election. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=632.6s)]
*  You see what I mean? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=634.6s)]
*  You don't have to explicitly instruct your minions to carry out the conspiracy theories [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=636.6s)]
*  and people will just join in. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjLWSkbjOoI&t=641.6s)]
