# Refugees Pour Out Of Ukraine: 'Anywhere They Can Get Just To Escape All Of This'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU)
*  More than 3.6 million refugees have fled Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=0.0s)]
*  The number includes more than 2.1 million refugees who fled here to Poland. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=3.84s)]
*  And today we got a somber assessment about the number of children in Ukraine who've had [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=9.08s)]
*  to flee their homes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=13.84s)]
*  UNICEF announced today that more than half of Ukraine's children, a staggering 4.3 million [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=15.32s)]
*  children, have been displaced one month into the war. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=21.92s)]
*  With that humanitarian crisis worsening by the minute, President Biden today in Brussels [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=26.08s)]
*  announced that the U.S. will accept up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine with a focus [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=29.96s)]
*  on reuniting displaced Ukrainians with family in the United States. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=36.06s)]
*  He also announced the U.S. will donate more than a billion dollars to help European countries [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=41.1s)]
*  deal with the surge in refugees. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Here in Warsaw, Poland, a city that has already accepted about three times more refugees than [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  the U.S. is planning to take. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=53.0s)]
*  The regional government has stepped up to take care of its share of this huge crush [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=55.0s)]
*  of people. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=58.68s)]
*  This sea of cots at this Warsaw Convention Center may look familiar, like the scenes [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=62.0s)]
*  that follow hurricanes, floods and fires. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=66.84s)]
*  But this disaster is entirely man-made, and the people sheltering here may not have the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=69.78s)]
*  chance to rebuild their homes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=75.26s)]
*  We came here two days ago because we need help. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=76.72s)]
*  We don't know what to do and how to live. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=81.6s)]
*  Currently, we're planning to find a house in the UK. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=84.6s)]
*  We don't have anything in the UK, but just people who are willing to help us. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=88.6s)]
*  Eve Prokopenko is just 15. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=96.08s)]
*  She's here with her mother, alongside 6,000 other refugees here on this day. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=98.52s)]
*  Most don't have a plan. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  To help, the regional government has turned this massive convention center into a safe [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=106.6s)]
*  haven for up to 20,000 people. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=110.64s)]
*  Many arrive sick, so there's medical care on site. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=115.8s)]
*  Obviously, most of the people coming here are women and children, so we have a gynecologist's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  office. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=125.84s)]
*  And for pregnant women, we can do diagnostics, and you can even give birth here, which we've [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=126.84s)]
*  already done a couple of times. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=134.0s)]
*  Despite Warsaw being the biggest center that receives refugees from Ukraine, what you won't [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=136.8s)]
*  see anywhere around the city are tents or temporary housing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=141.16s)]
*  A number of refugees are going to a stadium where they can spend some time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=144.76s)]
*  They're generally then sent to a hostel or some sort of temporary accommodation, but [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=148.56s)]
*  after a few days, they end up in private accommodation hosted by Poles or they leave for other European [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=152.96s)]
*  cities. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=159.16s)]
*  Many of those cities can be reached with the help of a temporary bus terminal set up outside [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=160.28s)]
*  the convention hall. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=165.0s)]
*  About a thousand people leave each day, as thousands more pour in. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=166.92s)]
*  Some who arrive here, like Eve and her mom, hope to get as far away as possible. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=171.88s)]
*  As we heard, even Russia wants to invade Poland. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=177.88s)]
*  That's horrifying. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=182.2s)]
*  We're right here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=183.8s)]
*  So we see a lot of buses and just people are going in really different countries in Europe, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=186.68s)]
*  like in Poland, Italy, everywhere. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=194.8s)]
*  Anywhere they can get just to escape all this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=198.0s)]
*  That's just one center in one city in Poland, which has shouldered more of the refugee burden [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=204.4s)]
*  than any country so far. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxajY7cc1XU&t=224.8s)]
