# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 18
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM)
*  Nearly 300,000. That's the number of refugees the UNHCR says have now arrived here in Hungary. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=0.0s)]
*  Impossibly large numbers, but they don't tell the stories of the highly specific individual needs of every one of those people who arrive here with literally all they can carry. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=7.0s)]
*  Unclear about whether they will ever see home again, but that's not a question for them to answer today. Today, they need the basics. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=17.0s)]
*  As you know, this country's government was downright awful to the Syrian refugees, but even then, many people in Hungary stepped up to help the displaced Syrians, including the organizers of a group called Migration Aid. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=24.0s)]
*  And now they're at it again, this time for the Ukrainians. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=37.0s)]
*  Budapest, a river city where a kaleidoscope of architecture from Romanesque to Renaissance rises from the streets. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=40.0s)]
*  A city of 1.7 million people now rising to help thousands of new residents, residents who are refugees arriving from Ukraine. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=49.0s)]
*  This is a storage room. Everything that you see here are coming from donations from our friends and community. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=59.0s)]
*  On the outskirts of the city, a local nonprofit has rushed to transform an office building into a hostel for refugees, food and shelter for up to 300 people. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=64.0s)]
*  So for example, we have a two person bedroom here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=75.0s)]
*  This is this is one of the smallest rooms. We have, of course, two beds and the bathroom with their own toilets and shower privacy and comfort. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=80.0s)]
*  A playroom lets kids colorful imaginations roam. Martin Elody is one of the organizers who helped get the doors open just a couple of days ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=89.0s)]
*  So currently we have 110 people here, but during the night we expect that this number will go up as the trains from the from the east will arrive. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=97.0s)]
*  Maria Bidna arrived with her family by train from Mikolayev, Ukraine. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=106.0s)]
*  They're staying for a few days, trying to figure out how to get to Germany where they don't have friends or family. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=112.0s)]
*  We are going to Munich and we are hoping to get a job there because it is a big city. So there are a lot of possibilities. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=118.0s)]
*  Across town, the workshop restaurant is serving a different need. Fresh hot meals right next door to Budapest's Ukrainian cultural center. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=125.0s)]
*  It's just heartbreaking to hear all these stories, how they have family behind who can't come with them and they just are lost and they don't know what to do. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=135.0s)]
*  And they're just seeking kindness, kindness from people who understand. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=146.0s)]
*  Anastasia Harko left her family behind in Ukraine two weeks ago. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=150.0s)]
*  Just couldn't sit and wait and just constantly read news. It was driving me crazy and I thought that the best thing to do is to help. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=155.0s)]
*  She's now volunteering at the restaurant and as families eat, Angelina Kezarova has started an art therapy program. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=166.0s)]
*  She's a psychotherapist who came to Budapest with her two children. Her husband is back in Ukraine as well. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=177.0s)]
*  She showed us these drawings that reveal both children's trauma and truth. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=183.0s)]
*  This boy, he say this is my family, this father because he's strong. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=188.0s)]
*  And while across Budapest we found people in need of rebuilding their lives, like the buildings that rise above these streets, the Ukrainians we've met say they will rise again. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=199.0s)]
*  You can see how Ukrainians fight. I guess everyone in the world realizes nowadays what it means to be Ukrainian. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=210.0s)]
*  The war in Ukraine started 23 days ago, but judging by the destruction we're seeing in cities all across that country, you might well think that this assault has been going on much longer than that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=221.0s)]
*  Entire residential zones are being bombed. Schools, hospitals, bars, shops, museums, theaters, all of them gone. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=231.0s)]
*  In this war, Russia is apparently making no distinction. Its forces are attacking everything and everyone in its path. And the evidence is in these photos. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=240.0s)]
*  This one was taken hours ago in the capital city of Kiev. This is someone's living room. It was destroyed by a Russian bombardment. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=249.0s)]
*  The owner, clearly in shock, covers his mouth while taking in the destruction. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=257.0s)]
*  Then there's this photo of an older man looking at what is left of the building that he used to live in in the Obolon district north of Kiev. It's almost as if he's saying goodbye. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=262.0s)]
*  These are the images of entire neighborhoods now turned into front lines of a war of people, soldiers doing what they can, using what they have to protect what's left, trying to survive as the sounds of bombs echo through entire apartment buildings, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=273.0s)]
*  hiding inside their homes, behind windows, protecting what they can, and looking to the outside world, their new world, with absolute fear. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=288.0s)]
*  All of these photos I've just shown you were taken by the Los Angeles Times photojournalist Marcus Yam. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=299.0s)]
*  He's been in Ukraine since the beginning of this conflict and is keeping a photo diary of life in times of war. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=304.0s)]
*  This entry from the past Sunday, March 13th, includes the photos that you see now. It reads, quote, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=311.0s)]
*  Dark smoke paints sky. A journalist killed. Daylight tears. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=328.0s)]
*  Joining us now, Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent and award-winning photojournalist Marcus Yam, joining us from the capital city of Kiev in Ukraine. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=335.0s)]
*  Marcus, thank you so much for being with us. Your photographs are at once illuminating and incomprehensible for the pain that they capture. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=343.0s)]
*  If you don't mind, I'd like to take our viewers through a few of them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=355.0s)]
*  And this one is one of a local resident sort of packing in and trying to clean up a home in a residential building caused by what authorities call a Russian bombardment. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=358.0s)]
*  This was on March 15th. It's an image of a man sort of taking things off his sofa. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=369.0s)]
*  Correct. I had spoken to that man very briefly and he said it was his blanket that he wanted to save. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=375.0s)]
*  There was shards of glass all over it, debris. And I was kind of amazed that he still was willing to dust it off and take it out with him. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=383.0s)]
*  You know, people hold on to things that they consider parts and pieces of their lives. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=392.0s)]
*  And the bombardment we've seen the last couple of days showcases Russia's scorch of policy. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=398.0s)]
*  They've killed more than 200 civilians in Kiev alone. And it's just awful, just awful. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=406.0s)]
*  It's been a very, very long 20-something days. Ukrainians are all very, very exhausted. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=414.0s)]
*  And I've spoken to so many people who echo the same sentiment. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=422.0s)]
*  Marcus, as I see people arriving here in Budapest or when I was on the border and watching people coming in, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=429.0s)]
*  many of them would come in with dogs and cats, their pets, in addition to their children. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=434.0s)]
*  You took a picture on March 13th of a man named Andrei Kulik. And he is in the middle of the street with a dog. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=440.0s)]
*  Can you tell me what's going on here? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=448.0s)]
*  That neighborhood was just bombarded the night before. And Andrei's dog refused to move and was paralyzed. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=451.0s)]
*  Andrei wanted to evacuate and couldn't bring his dog with him. And the dog refused to go anywhere. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=458.0s)]
*  So Andrei took a moment, you know, put everything down, put his head to the dog's head, reassured the dog that everything was going to be OK. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=464.0s)]
*  And eventually the dog relented and was led back into the home. And Andrei had left the dog behind. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=471.0s)]
*  Wow, that's heartbreaking. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=481.0s)]
*  There's a picture from today's photo diary, which is much more of the kind of thing that people are used to seeing when they think about war. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=484.0s)]
*  It's a group of soldiers carrying something that something is a sheet, a fabric that has a dead body in it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=491.0s)]
*  Correct. I had seen I had walked into the scene and immediately stumbled into the dead body. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=503.0s)]
*  And and I was just very shocked to see, you know, the position of the body. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=509.0s)]
*  I mean, the hands and his hands were together. It looked like he was asleep. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=514.0s)]
*  I only I only hoped and prayed that it was painless when when it all happened. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=519.0s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I don't know how to measure what's more sad, those images or this next image that was also from today's photo diary of a man who did not die, but he has come back to his home. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=524.0s)]
*  We can't see his face, but the caption suggests that he is crying. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=537.0s)]
*  Correct. This is a gentleman named Nick. And this is his bedroom. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=544.0s)]
*  He told me and and he he would keep coming back to his bedroom back and forth, back and forth from helping his other family members out. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=548.0s)]
*  But he would just come back, take a peek, come back, go come back, take a peek. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=556.0s)]
*  Eventually, from time to time, we and and and and and look for things that, you know, try to hold on to something and eventually eventually picked up, you know, bags of candy to take with him. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=560.0s)]
*  It just goes to show like, you know, he's not going to die. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=572.0s)]
*  He didn't know what to do. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=575.0s)]
*  And I have to tell you, as I look through your photographs, it's it's kind of hard for us to keep it together as we look at them because they so so graphically capture what's happening there. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=576.0s)]
*  How do you manage, Marcus? How do you deal with this? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=586.0s)]
*  I know you've done this a lot before. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=589.0s)]
*  How do you take in this this grief and this tragedy and process it? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=590.0s)]
*  I, you know, I'm going to be honest, I I haven't figured that out. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=594.0s)]
*  I've been compartmentalizing as much as I can. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=597.0s)]
*  I remind myself I have a job. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=600.0s)]
*  I have a job to do. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=603.0s)]
*  And, you know, I can't just give, you know, give into my emotions just just yet. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=605.0s)]
*  I can't just give up. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=610.0s)]
*  I can't just give up. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=612.0s)]
*  I can't just give up. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=613.0s)]
*  I can't just give up. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=615.0s)]
*  I can't just give up. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=617.0s)]
*  I can't just give up. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=619.0s)]
*  I can't just give, you know, give into my emotions just just yet because it's not about me. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=621.0s)]
*  It's about, you know, the the suffering of civilians and it's about the unjustness of this whole situation. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=626.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I have to push it all aside and we try our best. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=634.0s)]
*  I mean, I'll like I said, I'm only human, but I we forge forward. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=637.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=643.0s)]
*  We have many humans we have who are covering this war and taking those images and bearing witness for the world. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=646.0s)]
*  So please look after yourself, Mark. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=652.0s)]
*  Marcus, we appreciate the work that you've done. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=654.0s)]
*  The award winning photojournalist for the Los Angeles Times, Marcus. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=656.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Ambassador Gary Locke. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=663.0s)]
*  He was the United States ambassador to China during the Obama administration, a former governor of Washington state ambassador. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=665.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for being with us tonight. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=671.0s)]
*  I think it's complicated because it looks to the rest of the world like everybody's turning on Russia. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=674.0s)]
*  But if China stays with Russia, Russia can can hold out for a lot longer. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=680.0s)]
*  Thank you very much, Ali. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=686.0s)]
*  It's China is certainly in a predicament because even the images that we have been seeing every day on our television sets is being being broadcast to the Chinese people. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=688.0s)]
*  And it's really the Chinese government is still holding the incredible destruction, violence, death and mayhem of Ukraine at the hands of the Russians. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=700.0s)]
*  At the same time, the Chinese government is still enunciating the Russian line that this is really the fault of the West and NATO for coming so close to the borders of Russia. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=712.0s)]
*  China is not going to have longstanding ties with with Russia and would like to displace the Western order invented devised by the EU and the United States. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=725.0s)]
*  Nonetheless, the trade between China, the United States and the EU is 10 times the amount of trade that it does with Russia. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=737.0s)]
*  So I think China is fearing economic sanctions from the West were it to provide military or even economic aid to Russia. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=746.0s)]
*  And look, American polls indicate that American citizens are OK with the economic sanctions against Russia in the same way that in Europe, European citizens are concerned about it because of the amount of trade with Russia, particularly as it relates to energy. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=757.0s)]
*  At some point, economic sanctions against China or some kind of a conflict with China on that front. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=774.0s)]
*  That's something that's going to hit Americans in the pocketbook. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=780.0s)]
*  And they may not sit as well with. That's correct, because you're you're already seeing within Europe some reservation about going after a Russian oil exports and natural gas to Europe because they depend on those energy supplies to to heat their homes and to provide gasoline for their automobiles and to keep their factories going. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=783.0s)]
*  That's why many of the sanctions have kind of gone around to avoid touching those exports of of natural gas or energy that Europe depends on. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=803.0s)]
*  What has happened is that I think Russia and China were surprised, startled by how swiftly the West and how extensively the West imposed sanctions, very broad range sanctions against Russia. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=815.0s)]
*  But it's going to be more difficult to impose those same type of sanctions against China, because, for instance, cutting Russia off the international payment financial system hurts those Russian companies. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=829.0s)]
*  And of course, not many U.S. companies and European countries do trade with with Russia. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=842.0s)]
*  However, if we were to kick China off of the international financial system, the swift system by which transactions occur, well, how will our wheat farmers, our soybean farmers, our port exporters get paid from China if they sell to China? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=848.0s)]
*  If we stop all trade with China, where are we going to get our clothes, our shoes, our sporting goods, our tools, so much of which is made in China that we buy at Macy's Home Depot Target, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=868.0s)]
*  So there will be a huge impact to American consumers as well. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=881.0s)]
*  The challenge then is for the Biden administration. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=885.0s)]
*  If China were to provide military or economic assistance to Russia in the invasion of Ukraine, how can the Biden administration have targeted sanctions going after specific companies or specific units of the Chinese government? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=888.0s)]
*  This is a garage in Lithuania where volunteers are working around the clock to turn ordinary cars into battle ready vehicles for Ukrainian soldiers to use on the front lines against Russian invaders. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=904.0s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=916.0s)]
*  The cars are bought from or donated by civilians looking to aid the Ukrainian people in any way that they can. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=917.0s)]
*  Volunteers check the engines, retrofit them with armored plating, and give them a new coat of green paint so that they're not going to stand out on the battlefield. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=924.0s)]
*  The vehicles are then piled up and driven south as fast as they can through Lithuania and Poland to a secure checkpoint on the Ukrainian border. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=933.0s)]
*  So if someone asks you what a trucker convoy for freedom looks like, please show them this picture. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=943.0s)]
*  Now one reason we know about this Ukrainian armored truck pipeline is thanks to incredible new reporting by the Washington Post's Steve Hendricks exploring how critical supplies are making their way to Ukraine from supportive neighboring countries. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=950.0s)]
*  It's not just cars. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=963.0s)]
*  These convoys are carrying all kinds of emergency supplies to Ukrainian soldiers on the front line, everything from generators and mobile kitchen units to surveillance drones and night vision gear. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=964.0s)]
*  The most important equipment making its way over the border, bulletproof vests and helmets to protect Ukrainian fighters from Russian bullets. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=976.0s)]
*  Now, once the supplies reach Ukraine, the mission quickly shifts from urgent to perilous. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=984.0s)]
*  Today, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov declared that anything carrying military supplies in Ukraine will be considered legitimate targets for Russian strikes. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=990.0s)]
*  But Ukrainians seem to be willing to take the risk to get the supplies that they need. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1002.0s)]
*  As one Ukrainian lieutenant told the Washington Post, quote, from the army, we get the gun and the ammunition and the uniform. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1006.0s)]
*  But under the uniform, what we eat, what keeps us safe, how we move around and fight that comes from the people, our people and foreign people. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1013.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1024.0s)]
*  Joining us now is the Washington Post Jerusalem bureau chief Steve Hendricks, who's the lead byline on the story. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1025.0s)]
*  What do they make of the idea that Sergey Lavrov said it today? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1030.0s)]
*  But Vladimir Putin has said it many times. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1034.0s)]
*  Anybody basically helping the Ukrainian military is considered a legitimate target. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1037.0s)]
*  Well, I think they have mixed feelings. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1045.0s)]
*  One is this is this is not a secret process. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1047.0s)]
*  The location of some of the steps along the way they want to keep as quiet as possible, although they're fully aware that Russia knows what's going on in many cases. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1050.0s)]
*  But the process itself, these are public campaigns. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1058.0s)]
*  They need public support. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1062.0s)]
*  That's why they gave us permission to let us embed with the process from beginning to end. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1064.0s)]
*  And for this particular story, they're taking a risk and they know it. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1069.0s)]
*  But I think the risk as they perceive it isn't so much in Lithuania or transporting through Poland or even on the Polish border where the where the supplies are handed off. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1073.0s)]
*  But it's once they the soldiers begin taking them back to their battlefield positions in Ukraine. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1083.0s)]
*  And we talked to several people this week for this story who had driven 11, 12, 15, 16 hours from the east of Ukraine to pick up these supplies. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1090.0s)]
*  We're turning around again to get back in a couple of the guys suggested to me that this is the least dangerous part of their lives these days. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1102.0s)]
*  It's when they get back that they feel like they are in pretty constant peril. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1111.0s)]
*  The governments of Lithuania and Poland, by the way, the two places through which these convoys come are, in fact, the strongest NATO partners in terms of wanting to push back on Russia. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1116.0s)]
*  They are these are governments and people who are actually worried about Russian expansion. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1127.0s)]
*  But what you're describing here are civilian efforts, not not governmental efforts. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1131.0s)]
*  Yeah, but the impulse is the same. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1135.0s)]
*  The people, the citizens of Lithuania that I talked to feel like the Ukrainian fighters are fighting a defensive battle for Lithuania as well as for Ukraine. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1138.0s)]
*  They they are members of NATO. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1146.0s)]
*  They know they are protected by Article five and the shield. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1148.0s)]
*  But especially people who lived in the Soviet era can only imagine what Russia and Vladimir Putin have in mind for countries like Lithuania, tiny Baltic country right on Russia's shadow if he prevails in Ukraine. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1152.0s)]
*  So they see this as their fight. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1171.0s)]
*  And I was very moved and very impressed by the depth of support, the flags that are everywhere, the restaurants that are raising money, giving portions of their support. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1174.0s)]
*  I happened to be there during Lithuania's own Independence Day recently when they when they did shed the Soviet cloak. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1185.0s)]
*  And there were as many Ukrainian flags on display as Lithuanian flags. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1194.0s)]
*  They really do see this as their fight. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1199.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANEMVqxJLM&t=1203.0s)]
