# Unifying power Of January 6 For Extremist Groups Being Examined By Congressional Panel
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc)
*  On January 5th of last year, the day before the attack on the Capitol, there was a meeting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=0.0s)]
*  in a random D.C. parking garage between the leaders of two of the most radical right-wing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=4.22s)]
*  extremist groups in America, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=10.02s)]
*  We've known about this meeting for a little while now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=15.48s)]
*  No one involved has been particularly forthcoming about the purpose of that clandestine meetup. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=17.34s)]
*  But now we know that the FBI is trying to figure it out. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=22.66s)]
*  Reuters exclusively reporting today that federal investigators are now looking into that meeting [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=25.82s)]
*  between the two extremist groups, which took place 24 hours before members of both groups [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  orchestrated a coordinated attack to try and overthrow the results of the election. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=36.34s)]
*  Now to stop something like January 6th from ever happening again, part of the complicated [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=41.86s)]
*  granular work that has to be done is to really understand how these kinds of extremist groups [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=45.78s)]
*  operate. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=51.58s)]
*  Because until that shoe leather work is done, it's just kind of like pulling up weeds. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=53.02s)]
*  More and more threats from more extremist groups will keep popping up. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  You have to dig deeper. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=61.1s)]
*  You have to pull the whole system up by the root. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=62.1s)]
*  And in tandem with this new line of inquiry by the FBI, it seems like there's another [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=64.98s)]
*  team of investigators that are doing just that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=70.42s)]
*  Reporter Ben Collins here at NBC News is something of an extremist expert. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=74.26s)]
*  He operates in and among those weeds, and he's out with fresh reporting about how investigators [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=77.42s)]
*  from the January 6th investigation in Congress are trying to piece together the origin stories [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=82.18s)]
*  of these two extremist groups in the hopes that it'll shed light on the Capitol riot. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=87.9s)]
*  Quote, the committee's investigators are zeroing in on events attended by members of the Proud [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=92.9s)]
*  Boys and Oath Keepers in 2020. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=97.78s)]
*  Those events include COVID lockdown protests, counter protests to some racial justice demonstrations, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  armed protest activity focused on state capitals across the U.S. and stop the steel rallies [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=107.58s)]
*  that occurred prior to January 6th, 2021. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=112.98s)]
*  The investigators assigned to the domestic extremism inquiry are split into two teams. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  The red team is concentrating on the events that took place on January 6th. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=122.22s)]
*  And then there's a whole separate team, the purple team, looking into how these anti-democracy [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=126.82s)]
*  factions formed in the months before January 6th and how they've evolved in the year since. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=131.66s)]
*  And the goal behind this is pretty straightforward. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=138.46s)]
*  Quote, the goal, according to several of the investigators who spoke with NBC News, is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=141.06s)]
*  to determine whether these earlier events were proving grounds, opportunities to network, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=146.01999999999998s)]
*  or places to encourage one another to cross red lines into future violence. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=152.14s)]
*  Joining us now is NBC senior reporter Ben Collins, who covers disinformation and extremism. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=157.66s)]
*  He broke this new reporting today. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=162.22s)]
*  My friend, it's good to see you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=164.38s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=165.5s)]
*  Ben, what kind of things are they looking for that will demonstrate what you report [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=166.94s)]
*  in your reporting, that they're looking to see what they were doing at these other things [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=173.42s)]
*  and what connection they had to January 6th? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they're looking for hard and fast connections between groups like the Oath Keepers and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=181.1s)]
*  the Proud Boys and QAnon conspiracy theorists that happened over the last year before the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=187.5s)]
*  January 6th riot. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=194.22s)]
*  That includes things like those state capital protests in Oregon and in Michigan that kind [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=195.82s)]
*  of presaged what happened on January 6th. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=202.06s)]
*  If you remember the one from Michigan that ended in the idea that they were going to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=205.1s)]
*  take the governor, it was a similarly violently rhetorical protest. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=210.06s)]
*  So they're looking for hard and fast connections there, but they're also looking for ideological [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=217.42s)]
*  similarities between some of these groups. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=220.66s)]
*  So the Proud Boys and QAnon people, they don't necessarily have a lot in common. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=222.98s)]
*  A lot of Proud Boys look down on QAnon people, they view them as silly, and it's still kind [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=226.77999999999997s)]
*  of unclear how they came to the same conclusion that January 6th, they all had to storm the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=231.72s)]
*  Capitol and they all had to fight back for President Trump. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=235.61999999999998s)]
*  Some of these people have been charged in the litany of charges that a lot of the demonstrators [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  face. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  Some of them have been charged very specifically with conspiracy, but not a lot of them are [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=246.3s)]
*  cooperating. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=249.74s)]
*  Is there some idea that they can get people like you would in the mob, get people who [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=251.28s)]
*  are lower down who don't have the resources or the gumption to hold out to start telling [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  authorities what's behind some of these organizations? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=260.92s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=263.66s)]
*  And some are cooperating, by the way. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=265.66s)]
*  Stuart Rhodes, who is a member of the Oath Keepers, last week dialed into a video conference. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=267.02000000000004s)]
*  He was indicted by the Feds, but he still dialed into a video conference with the January [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=273.02s)]
*  6th committee, and he didn't completely take the fifth. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=277.5s)]
*  He did answer some questions. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=279.7s)]
*  There's a lot of trees to shake here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=282.62s)]
*  You're going to see a lot of that over time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=284.9s)]
*  And they also have, both the Feds and the January 6th committee, they have more hard [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=287.34s)]
*  and fast data that has nothing to do with people's testimonies. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=293.62s)]
*  It has to do with where people were on that day and the days before, social media posts, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=295.9s)]
*  things like that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=301.06s)]
*  So, you know, they are going to get to the bottom of this, it seems like. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=302.18s)]
*  It's just going to take a while. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=306.22s)]
*  You're right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=308.22s)]
*  This was actually published in Lawfare, but it talks about the fact that the Proud Boys [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=309.5s)]
*  role on January 6th was more furtive than the Oath Keepers, but also more violent and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=312.74s)]
*  momentous. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=317.18s)]
*  Just one among the 21 accused Oath Keepers who have been charged with assaulting a police [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=318.22s)]
*  officer, for instance, where many of the Proud Boys have been. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=322.38s)]
*  What's their connection, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=328.1s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=331.06s)]
*  They're kind of two disparate ideas. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=332.06s)]
*  The Oath Keepers were created shortly after Barack Obama took office, the idea that you [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=333.66s)]
*  have to keep an oath to defend the rule in the United States. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=338.94s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=343.58s)]
*  The Proud Boys were created during the Trump era. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=344.58s)]
*  The Proud Boys are like a militant street gang, basically, that was created to fight [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=346.14s)]
*  back against what they believed to be leftist violence in the streets. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=350.86s)]
*  And that's why they were constantly in these racial justice protests, trying to stir up [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=354.54s)]
*  more agitation. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=360.86s)]
*  The Proud Boys are inherently a more violent group. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=362.22s)]
*  It takes getting into a physical fight to be initiated as a high level Proud Boy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=364.86s)]
*  Whereas the Oath Keepers were planning a much larger thing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=370.5s)]
*  They are largely filled with people who are ex-military, ex-police, and they had a plan. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=373.3s)]
*  These people were wearing earpieces and talked to each other in the day. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=380.62s)]
*  And they had this idea for QRF squads, which are basically bringing ammo in, bringing weapons [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  in later in the day that they had stored at their hotel room. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=389.86s)]
*  So one was, you know, the Proud Boys are basically just like a street gang waiting to fight on [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=394.1s)]
*  command. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=398.86s)]
*  And the Oath Keepers were kind of a military. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=399.86s)]
*  Those are the two big differences there. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=402.02000000000004s)]
*  One of the things in your piece that was interesting is you talk about how the revelation of details [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=403.46000000000004s)]
*  from the House Committee's investigation comes as federal law enforcement agencies remain [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=407.76s)]
*  on alert for domestic terrorism. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=412.26s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security issued an advisory Monday saying that the U.S. remains [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=414.42s)]
*  in a heightened threat environment fueled by several factors, including an online environment [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=418.5s)]
*  filled with false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories and other forms of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=423.62s)]
*  mis, dis, and malinformation, or MDM, introduced and or amplified by foreign and domestic threat [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=427.94s)]
*  actors. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=434.66s)]
*  So there's a bigger piece to this, which you've been studying for years, that is enveloping [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=435.66s)]
*  this current matter. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=441.02s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to some people on the committee, some investigators on the committee about [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=442.5s)]
*  And they are similarly worried about this. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=447.3s)]
*  And I might end up in whatever report they wind up producing that'll be like a Mueller [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=448.94s)]
*  report or a Warren commission at the end of the day. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=452.58000000000004s)]
*  But they are really worried about this anti-elite sentiment that is being pushed by these groups [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=455.66s)]
*  that used to be pretty separate. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=462.24s)]
*  The Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the QAnon people, the anti-vax community, they're kind [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=463.74s)]
*  of coalescing. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  All of them seem to think there is a new world order out to get them. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=469.5s)]
*  All of them seem to think that there is this hand above the United States government that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=472.58s)]
*  is pushing people down. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=478.82s)]
*  The parallels in history to this are very scary. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=482.38s)]
*  This is the stuff that you get before very grim times in history. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=485.82s)]
*  It's deeply anti-Semitic, it's deeply racist. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=490.46s)]
*  That's how you get to this moment. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=493.14s)]

*  You see this in Europe with the anti-vax protests over there that are a little bit more violent [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=497.5s)]

*  This is a global movement of, I think they want it to be called populism, but it's a [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=508.18s)]
*  global movement of anti-elitism, anti-authoritarianism, sorry, anti-authority in general, pro-authoritarianism. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=514.24s)]
*  It's basically anarchy. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=521.8199999999999s)]
*  And that's what they are rooting for so they can reinstitute a system, a revenge system [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCCe8e5ZPFc&t=523.24s)]
