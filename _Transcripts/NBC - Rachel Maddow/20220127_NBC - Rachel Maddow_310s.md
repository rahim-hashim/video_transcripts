# Arizona Attorney General Too Busy Kissing Up To Trump To Deal With Fake Elector Referral
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY)
*  Here's the letter, Arizona's Secretary of State writing to the person who sent in that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=0.0s)]
*  fake electors document saying, number one, stop using the state seal, it's illegal, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=5.5s)]
*  and number two, we're referring you to the attorney general's office for potential prosecution. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=10.06s)]
*  The following day, on December 23rd, we've got the Secretary of State making that formal [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=14.86s)]
*  criminal referral to the AG's office. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  And it is a very straightforward thing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=21.7s)]
*  We received these documents from these Arizona residents purporting to be official state [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=23.94s)]
*  documents using the official state seal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=29.26s)]
*  These were not real official documents. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=31.76s)]
*  Use of the state seal by anybody not authorized to use it is a crime in Arizona. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=34.84s)]
*  Here's all the material. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=39.24s)]
*  This is a crime. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=40.54s)]
*  Please proceed, Mr. Attorney General. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=41.540000000000006s)]
*  That formal criminal referral was made to the Arizona Attorney General's office December [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=45.34s)]
*  23rd, 2020. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=48.94s)]
*  So more than a year ago. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=49.94s)]
*  Since then, nothing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=53.24s)]
*  So there's two questions here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=57.76s)]
*  One of them is about the federal cops on the beat here, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=60.72s)]
*  Why did federal investigators at the National Archives only open an investigation into [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=63.12s)]
*  one of the two fake slates of electors they received from Arizona? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=68.36s)]
*  Sure, that one came in first, but a few days later, when a second set of fake elector documents [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=72.24s)]
*  came in from Arizona and from a bunch of other states, why wasn't a federal investigation [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=77.8s)]
*  launched into those as well? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=83.2s)]
*  Or was it? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=85.2s)]
*  We are trying to find out. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=87.24s)]
*  We will let you know as soon as we have figured it out. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=88.24s)]
*  But also, in this situation in Arizona, I mean, again, they had two fake electors slates [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  from two different sets of Republicans in Arizona, and this one with the state seal [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=96.8s)]
*  on it was kind of a special case, kind of an open and shut case. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=100.24s)]
*  Using the state seal on your forged document is its own crime. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  And here's the Secretary of State's office saying, Hi, Attorney General, crime here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=108.52s)]
*  Please prosecute. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=112.28s)]
*  That was over a year ago. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  So far, nothing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=115.28s)]
*  What happened with this at the Attorney General's office in Arizona? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=117.4s)]
*  Why did this dead end there? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=120.14s)]
*  Well, let's turn to local journalists in Arizona to see what they think. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=122.6s)]
*  Ah, Lori Roberts writing this week for the Arizona Republic, quote, anyone waiting breathlessly [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=127.68s)]
*  for Attorney General Mark Bernovich to launch an investigation into the fake Trump electors [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=133.32s)]
*  who participated in a scheme to overturn Arizona's vote should wait no longer. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=138.12s)]
*  Bernovich's latest fundraising plea makes it abundantly clear that he has no intention [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=143.2s)]
*  of actually doing his job. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=147.6s)]
*  And then she shows this recent fundraising gambit from the Arizona Attorney General. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=150.11999999999998s)]
*  Are you really going to ignore President Trump? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  We thought he could count on you, Bernovich says in this fundraiser, making the making [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=156.67999999999998s)]
*  the rounds to Republicans on Facebook. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=160.72s)]
*  Quote, this is your last chance to help flip Arizona and take back the Senate. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  Don't miss your chance to be on Trump's team. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=167.06s)]
*  Lori Roberts continues, quote, set aside for a second that this fundraising plea is a blatant [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=171.52s)]
*  misrepresentation of the truth. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=175.72s)]
*  Trump hasn't endorsed Bernovich in Arizona. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=177.84s)]
*  And in fact, Trump threw a fundraiser for one of Bernovich's opponents. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=181.2s)]
*  Bernovich is in a crowded Republican race for this Senate seat, a race in which every candidate [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=184.64s)]
*  is competing to be anointed by Trump for the job. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=189.4s)]
*  But Trump has not endorsed anyone in that Senate race. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=192.24s)]
*  Bernovich should be investigating the phony Trump electors who in December 2020 signed [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=195.52s)]
*  a document avowing that they represented the true electoral votes from Arizona. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=199.92s)]
*  They sent it by registered mail to the U.S. Senate and the National Archives. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=204.55999999999997s)]
*  Fortunately, federal investigators are now looking into it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=208.48s)]
*  But shouldn't the state's prosecutor have at least a passing interest in such a blatant [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  scheme carried out right under his nose? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=216.11999999999998s)]
*  Roberts continues, quote, it seems painfully clear that you can't be both the attorney [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  general of Arizona in charge of investigating all aspects of the 2020 election and a U.S. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  Senate candidate who is chasing Trump's endorsement. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=228.76s)]
*  At least you shouldn't be. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  The conflict of interest is oh so clearly evident in Bernovich's latest fundraising [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=234.12s)]
*  plea. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  Bernovich's heart may lie with Trump, but his obligation remains to the people of Arizona. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  He should resign. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=244.44s)]
*  That's from the Arizona Republic today. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  Calls for the Arizona attorney general to resign if, among other things, he's not going [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  to prosecute the state's fake electors. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=254.6s)]
*  And I'm I'm not close enough to Arizona politics to know about the likelihood of any resignation [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=258.04s)]
*  here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=263.0s)]
*  I'm guessing that's not going to happen. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=264.0s)]
*  But if you're wondering why there's a need for a federal investigation, if you're wondering [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=265.0s)]
*  why the U.S. Justice Department now says they are investigating, well, this kind of mischigas [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  in the states might help explain why that's needed. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=274.8s)]
*  I mean, in this case, no action for more than a year, even in the most clear-cut imaginable [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  case where state law was definitely for sure, no doubt about it, broken. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTC8vBgJ2EY&t=283.84s)]
