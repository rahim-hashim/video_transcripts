# Why Biden Hit A Nerve With Threat To Seize Russian Oligarchs' Yachts
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g)
*  And, Richard, as full-throated as President Biden has been in asking for support for the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=0.0s)]
*  Ukrainian people, and you definitely saw a bipartisan show of that tonight, and as insistent [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=6.38s)]
*  as he has been that U.S. troops will defend NATO, but we will not put U.S. boots on the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=10.88s)]
*  ground inside Ukraine, which is an ally but not a NATO ally, he's also been able to lead [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=15.6s)]
*  the world in a unified Western response that has put in very strong sanctions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=23.36s)]
*  Tonight, he did talk about upping those in a way that got bipartisan cheers on the floor [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=27.6s)]
*  of the House chamber. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=32.84s)]
*  He talked about moving on from freezing assets to seizing assets, including going after, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=33.84s)]
*  as he described it, the yachts and the luxury apartments and the private planes of the oligarchs [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=41.0s)]
*  were coming for you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=44.92s)]
*  He said about, he ad-libbed a line he said that people were talking about, you have no [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=46.2s)]
*  idea what's coming. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=50.36s)]
*  Why will that matter? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Why could that make a difference in terms of Russian behavior, or could it? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=53.92s)]
*  We would make an enormous difference because Vladimir Putin, the way he has farmed out [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=60.52s)]
*  his money is he holds it through different oligarchs. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=65.88s)]
*  There are many different oligarchs who hold money for Putin and his family personally, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=70.08s)]
*  and generally they park it outside of the country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=76.8s)]
*  That is, in many ways, Russia's Achilles heel in all of this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=79.32s)]
*  It is also its logistical problems that it's having on its military, the fact that it relies [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  on very old-fashioned siege warfare. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=89.28s)]
*  But its biggest weakness is that the Russians don't keep their money in their own country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=91.6s)]
*  They keep it in the West, and they generally keep it through friendly oligarchs. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  And Putin can call on those oligarchs to move the money, to give it back to him, to disperse [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  with it as he pleases. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=108.88000000000001s)]
*  So if suddenly now governments like the United States, like Switzerland, like Monaco, like [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=110.68s)]
*  the United Kingdom suddenly start seizing hotels, football teams, yachts, homes, it [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=116.08s)]
*  will send the oligarchs running, it will send them scared, it will hurt Putin personally. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  It could enrage him, and we could have a situation here where you have a wounded animal, and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=131.24s)]
*  is the most dangerous kind. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=135.88s)]
*  But it will have a, it will certainly get the attention of the most powerful people [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  in Russia by hitting them where it hurts. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=143.84s)]
*  NBC's chief foreign correspondent, Richard Engel, live from Kiev tonight as dawn breaks. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=147.16s)]
*  Richard, thank you again for joining us, my friend. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USXmUJWkq6g&t=152.2s)]
