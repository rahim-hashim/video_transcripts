# Biden Reassurances Notwithstanding, Putin Fears Removal By U.S.
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA)
*  Though he often posts his messages in Russian, this weekend the Ukrainian President Volodymyr [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=0.0s)]
*  Zelensky gave his first big interview to Russian journalists since the beginning of the war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=5.12s)]
*  He talked to four of them at the same time over Zoom. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=10.68s)]
*  Now as soon as the Russian government got wind of this interview, it put out orders [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=14.44s)]
*  to quash it, threatening the journalists with potential imprisonment over having their licenses [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=18.2s)]
*  to print news revoked. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=24.16s)]
*  Of the outlets involved, those that are physically located outside of Russia published the interview. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=26.32s)]
*  But the two papers involved that still operate inside Russia did not. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=31.68s)]
*  One of those papers, Novaya Gazeta, suspended its operations completely today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=36.4s)]
*  They've been towing a careful line so far in the war, trying to report as accurately [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=41.76s)]
*  as possible while following all of the Russian government's censorship rules to avoid being [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=46.5s)]
*  shuttered. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=51.8s)]
*  Out of fear that they would have their license suspended, this note today explaining they [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=53.08s)]
*  are stopping their work will be the last thing that they publish until the war, or as they [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=57.72s)]
*  were forced to call it here, the special operation on the territory of Ukraine, is done. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  When you look through the other Russian newspaper involved, Kommersant, the interview with [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=70.9s)]
*  Zelensky is nowhere to be found. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=75.2s)]
*  What you do see on the front page, however, is this, quote, Biden denies plan to overthrow [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=77.82s)]
*  Putin. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=84.05999999999999s)]
*  This past weekend, President Biden generated tons of headlines in the West and in Russia [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=85.46s)]
*  for his comment about President Putin saying, quote, for God's sake, this man cannot remain [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=89.61999999999999s)]
*  in power. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=94.69999999999999s)]
*  The Russian press called it everything from a gaffe to an admission of the United States' [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=96.46s)]
*  secret long-term, quote, main goal. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=101.3s)]
*  And unlike the interview with President Zelensky, the story was everywhere in the Russian press, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=105.54s)]
*  and I mean literally everywhere. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=110.78s)]
*  It was entirely unavoidable. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=112.46s)]
*  And that makes sense, because of a bold statement by the leader of the United States. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=114.62s)]
*  But you would think that an interview with the leader of the country that Russia is currently [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=119.02s)]
*  at war with might get a little bit of attention, too. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=122.53999999999999s)]
*  But no. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=126.62s)]
*  There's a lot of debate about President Biden's statement about Putin in the West, whether [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=127.62s)]
*  it was an accident or a piece of strategy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=132.28s)]
*  And getting to the bottom of that is important. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=134.76s)]
*  But what I want to know is how did that line, Biden's line about how Putin has to go, how [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=136.52s)]
*  did it go over in Russia, given how much the Russian people are not seeing, how much they're [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=144.52s)]
*  not being able to read about the truth, the narratives they've been told now and for years? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=149.64s)]
*  How might the average Russian have read Biden's words? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=155.28s)]
*  Joining us now is Julia Yaffe. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=160.28s)]
*  She's a founding partner and Washington correspondent at PUC and longtime reporter on everything [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=161.8s)]
*  Russia related. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=166.44s)]
*  Julia, thank you for being with us. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=167.48s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=169.12s)]
*  Let's talk about this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=170.52s)]
*  How do Biden's comments fit into the narrative that most Russians already believe or are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=171.52s)]
*  being fed? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=176.96s)]
*  Well, the narrative they've been fed for a long time is the one that Putin believes himself, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=177.96s)]
*  for a long time, Washington has wanted regime change in Russia, just like it has pursued [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=185.84s)]
*  regime change all over the world. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=191.72s)]
*  And this goes back to the days of George W. Bush and the Freedom Agenda and what the U.S. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=193.76s)]
*  did in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=198.96s)]
*  And then what Russia believes or what Vladimir Putin believes the U.S. did or didn't do in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  Ukraine in 2004, in Georgia 2003, in Kyrgyzstan in 2005. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=207.68s)]
*  And then in Libya, he sees it all as part of a pattern of the U.S. ousting leaders it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=215.44s)]
*  doesn't like and he assumes that he's next in line. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=220.6s)]
*  And I think Russians are being fed this line that see, they're out to get us, they're out [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=224.96s)]
*  to get your president. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  They want to impose their will on Russia. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=230.88s)]
*  The question is, of course, can the U.S. actually implement such a policy if this is a policy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=234.24s)]
*  at all rather than an aspirational statement? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=239.84s)]
*  I don't think there's any talk by anybody sane or reasonable or actually anybody in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=242.0s)]
*  Washington about actually going into Russia and toppling Vladimir Putin, which would be [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=247.3s)]
*  pretty like a pretty impossible task. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=252.4s)]
*  Yeah, and that's not how I heard it when I heard him say it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=255.84s)]
*  I suspected it was an unscripted comment. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=260.64s)]
*  I suspect that it was Joe Biden saying what he believed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=263.36s)]
*  And I suspect that it was Joe Biden reflecting what a whole lot of people in the democracy [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=265.96s)]
*  loving world believe. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=270.88s)]
*  What's the distinction between it being policy? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=272.64s)]
*  And I think we all understand that's not policy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=276.04s)]
*  The U.S. government is not going to take out the leader of Russia. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=277.88s)]
*  But sentiment that Joe Biden can go around and share with people and maybe hope that the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=281.24s)]
*  Russian people hear themselves. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=286.12s)]
*  I mean, to some extent, it was just a statement of fact. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=289.88s)]
*  And it is a policy that the Biden administration has had from the very beginning when they [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=292.52s)]
*  when President Biden came into office, which was a recognition that as long as Vladimir [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=297.76s)]
*  Putin is the president of Russia, there will be no constructive change, no constructive [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=302.4s)]
*  dialogue, that very little in the way of any kind of meaningful cooperation or dialogue [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  is possible as long as he's president. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=312.88s)]
*  And so the U.S. should just contain him, keep the kind of do the bare minimum to keep that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  relationship going and not keep it from being getting destructive. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=321.12s)]
*  Because this was the first administration, by the way, that Putin has dealt with that has [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=326.32s)]
*  not pursued a reset with him, right, that has seen things clearly that Putin didn't want [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  to play nice, that he didn't want to find areas of agreement with the U.S. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  because he sees the U.S. as his primary foe. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=340.0s)]
*  So I just saw the comment by President Biden is in some ways a statement of fact and a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=343.12s)]
*  statement of longstanding policy, which is that as long as Putin is in power, a he's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=349.24s)]
*  killing two countries, both Russia and Ukraine, and nothing constructive, no constructive [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=355.24s)]
*  dialogue is possible with him. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjWjSlCdMfA&t=360.15999999999997s)]
