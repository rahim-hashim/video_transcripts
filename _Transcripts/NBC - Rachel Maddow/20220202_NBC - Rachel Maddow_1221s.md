# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 1
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I)
*  The more we learn about Trump's efforts to overthrow the government and prevent the next [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=0.0s)]
*  duly elected president from being sworn in, the more it sounds like a little bit like speed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=5.68s)]
*  dating, right? I mean, he tries roping the Defense Department into this scheme. Hey, send out the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=11.52s)]
*  military and go seize all the voting equipment. Military apparently passed. Then he tried the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=16.0s)]
*  Homeland Security Department. Also, yeah, passed. Also a no-go. Well, how about the Justice Department? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=21.04s)]
*  Bill Barr, have the Justice Department go out and seize the voting equipment. Apparently Bill [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=27.68s)]
*  Barr wasn't into it either. But in this new reporting from the Times, we learn about one more [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=32.24s)]
*  potential suitor, one more potential date that Donald Trump tried to get on board for his effort [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=38.16s)]
*  at an insurrection. This is fascinating to me. This is what the Times reports. Quote, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  around the same time that Mr. Trump brought up the possibility of having the Justice Department [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=49.92s)]
*  seize the voting machine, he also tried to persuade state lawmakers in contested states [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=54.48s)]
*  like Michigan and Pennsylvania that they should use local law enforcement agencies to take control [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  of the machines. The state lawmakers refused to go along with the plan. I mean, we should hear [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=65.6s)]
*  about it from those local Republicans in Michigan and Pennsylvania, but we should also probably hear [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=72.96s)]
*  about it from the January 6th investigation, potentially from anybody bringing criminal [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=78.16s)]
*  charges around this plot. Did anybody actually try it? How was this demand from the president received? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=83.12s)]
*  We've learned a lot about how Trump tried to use the power of the federal government to seize voting [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  machines, to try and change the results of the election in his favor. Was there a state-level [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=96.64s)]
*  component of his plan too? Joining us now is Michael Schmidt. He's the Washington correspondent [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  for the New York Times. He was one of the reporters who broke the story about Trump's involvement [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=105.68s)]
*  in the plans to seize the voting machines. Mr. Schmidt, it's nice to have you here tonight. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=109.36s)]
*  Congratulations on this scoop. Thanks for having me. It's been a lot of revelations [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=113.36s)]
*  in the last 48 hours. Let me just ask you if I put any of that wrong or if I've got the emphasis the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=120.0s)]
*  wrong way around, if there's anything that I'm missing out in terms of what you and your colleagues [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=125.36s)]
*  have reported. No, no, that was a great summation of it. I think that for us, the most important [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=128.4s)]
*  thing here is that there's a lot of different things that have emerged in the past year [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=137.52s)]
*  that we've learned that Donald Trump's advisors and Republicans across the country did. We also [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=144.0s)]
*  know a lot of what Donald Trump said out loud and did publicly. What our reporting, we thought, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=150.88s)]
*  advanced and what made it important is that it brought Trump himself into the effort in a way [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=159.28s)]
*  that we had not seen before. This was more than just using, calling people and pressuring them [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=166.48s)]
*  and filing fruitless lawsuits. This was contemplating using three of the most powerful [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=175.12s)]
*  institutions, not just in the country, but in the world, the Department of Defense, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  the Justice Department, and the Department of Homeland Security. To use that apparatus [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=189.2s)]
*  as the President of the United States, the person who controls them and consider using them [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=196.0s)]
*  in this effort to remain in power, sets itself out as one of the more extraordinary [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=203.6s)]
*  efforts that was underway to undermine this election. I'm not diminishing the other things [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=212.56s)]
*  that he tried, but we thought that this attempt was in a special lane of itself, and he was there [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=219.68s)]
*  and was more than just curious about the idea. Do we know, Mike, why they thought it would be [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=231.36s)]
*  necessary or helpful or would advance the plot to physically seize voting equipment? Whether they [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=243.12s)]
*  were going to have defense or Homeland Security or the Justice Department pull off this scheme, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=248.88s)]
*  why did they want the physical equipment? It's a great question. Even as we were finishing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=255.28s)]
*  our reporting on this, I was thinking to myself, why did they want these machines? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=261.76s)]
*  Because it's so different than any other type of election interference we've seen in this country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=268.56s)]
*  To our best understanding from our reporting, they wanted the machines because they thought that the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=278.24s)]
*  machines had been hacked. The conspiracy was that the Dominion machines had been hacked and that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  they needed to get their hands on the machines so they could show that there had been hacking and [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=290.72s)]
*  that votes had been turned away from Trump that should have been for him. They needed the machines [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=297.2s)]
*  in order to do that. At the same time, though, and I don't know how this relates to it, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=304.32s)]
*  Flynn wanted to rerun the election. Flynn wanted for the government to have another election. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=315.04s)]
*  I have no indication that the seizing of it was related to that, but Flynn, in these television [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=323.12s)]
*  appearances in which he said out loud the same stuff that's being reported here, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=330.24s)]
*  talked about the idea of rerunning the election. Presumably what happens here, if it works, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=336.8s)]
*  if they can get a federal agency to head out in force and start seizing voting equipment all over [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=346.32s)]
*  the country, that at the very least creates such a controversy, creates such a stir, creates [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=353.44s)]
*  such an appearance of seriousness about what's gone wrong in the election that that would [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=361.2s)]
*  undergird with steel any effort by state legislators to unfinalize election results, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=367.28s)]
*  to decertify election results, to say there's some reason that they can't clearly say that Biden won [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=374.32s)]
*  or that the results were definitive and conclusive. In the same way that we saw [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=380.08s)]
*  the Justice Department draft letter to Georgia where they were going to hype claims of fraud [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=386.88s)]
*  to Georgia state legislators as a basis for telling those legislators that they should reconsider [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=392.8s)]
*  the finalization of the electors there, presumably this would have been such a scandal, it would have [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  been such a constitutional crisis in the country that it would have opened the door to those, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  to friendly legislators in those states actually saying that the election wasn't over. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=408.08000000000004s)]
*  Correct. The problem was that he couldn't find someone to do it. And it's a constant theme [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=414.64s)]
*  that runs through his presidency, whether it's trying to fire Mueller or a range of different [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=421.44s)]
*  things. This is a pattern. He wants to do something, he doesn't want to do it himself, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=430.48s)]
*  he asks someone else to do it, he does it in a way that brings it up and says, when he's in the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=435.12s)]
*  Oval Office with Barr, he says, my lawyers say that the Justice Department can seize these things. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=440.24s)]
*  Is this something that the Justice Department could do without going that extra step to really [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=447.04s)]
*  directly ask Barr about it? And the thing that I was thinking about is you're asking that question [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=455.36s)]
*  is that in this instance, in this really, really important period of time, where you could argue [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=461.68s)]
*  that it came down to Bill Barr and Ken Cuccinelli basically giving Trump the Heisman and saying, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=467.44s)]
*  no, we're not going to do this. If that were to happen today, based on what has happened with [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=474.0s)]
*  the Republican Party and the way that Trump has continued to tug it in his direction and the way [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=481.44s)]
*  that they have continued to entertain, not just entertain, but go along with what he said, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=487.92s)]
*  I don't think it would have been, if that were to happen today and he were president, I don't think [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=493.52000000000004s)]
*  he would have such a difficult time finding someone to do it. I don't think there are governors [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=498.72s)]
*  that have shown immense loyalty to him across the country that are more and more loyal to him today [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=504.24s)]
*  than they were before. And I think if this had happened at a later date, he may have been [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  more successful. This weekend, former president Trump lashed out at prosecutors who appear to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=517.12s)]
*  have him in their sites in multiple ongoing criminal and civil investigations. He told his [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=523.2s)]
*  supporters that he wants them in the streets in DC and in Georgia, in New York, if these prosecutors [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=528.24s)]
*  act against Trump. Well, today we have some new reporting from the Washington Post that provides [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=534.16s)]
*  another window into why an investigation like the one being carried out by the New York attorney [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=538.72s)]
*  general, Letitia James, might be so concerning to the former president that he's calling for [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=543.44s)]
*  people to take to the streets in case the investigators act. The Post reports that the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=548.24s)]
*  New York AG's investigation has subpoenaed records about the Trump hotel in DC. That's a property [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=553.2800000000001s)]
*  that the Trump organization leases from the federal government. It's a federally owned property. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=560.8800000000001s)]
*  Letitia James's investigation is reportedly looking into whether Trump got the lease on that property [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=565.84s)]
*  through fraud, whether the Trump organization lied about its assets in order to obtain the lease for [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  the property and the loans they use to pay for it. We know from documents that were filed by [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=576.56s)]
*  attorney general James last month that it was Trump's adult daughter, Ivanka Trump, who, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=582.56s)]
*  according to the attorney general, negotiated the lease for that hotel with the federal government [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=587.8399999999999s)]
*  and negotiated a loan from Deutsche Bank to pay for it. Just James is arguing that the means by [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=591.68s)]
*  which the Trump organization described their own financial condition in order to get the lease [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=599.6s)]
*  and the loan were both fraudulent. Here's one example. As part of their statement of their [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=603.44s)]
*  assets to try to get the lease and the loan, the Trumps listed the value of apartments that they [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=609.28s)]
*  owned, including one that Ivanka was renting personally at the time. Under her rental agreement, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=613.6s)]
*  she apparently had the option to buy that apartment if she wanted to for the cost of [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  $8.5 million. But in the forms that were submitted to get the loan for the D.C. hotel, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=623.92s)]
*  that very same apartment was listed as being worth more than $20 million. Then a few years later, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=630.24s)]
*  they listed it as being worth $25 million, even though they knew there was an option to buy it [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=636.4s)]
*  for just $8.5 million. Attorney General James is looking into exactly that type of potentially [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=641.8399999999999s)]
*  illegal inflation of the Trump family and Trump organization's financial situation [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  for a whole bunch of Trump properties. Thanks to the Washington Post, we now know that the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=654.48s)]
*  Attorney General's investigation has subpoenaed the federal government about Trump's deal for [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=658.32s)]
*  that property in D.C. as well. So yeah, I mean, if I were the former president, I don't know that [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=662.24s)]
*  I'd be calling for my supporters to riot if I was indicted in this investigation, but I might be [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=667.9200000000001s)]
*  concerned. I'll be right back. So this guy, Gregory Jacob, the vice president, Pence's top lawyer. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=674.08s)]
*  For the investigators trying to get to the bottom of Donald Trump's efforts to overthrow the U.S. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=684.1600000000001s)]
*  government and prevent the newly elected president from being sworn in, for those investigators, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=688.88s)]
*  Gregory Jacob is an interesting fact witness, right? I mean, he was in the room with Trump when [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=695.2s)]
*  Trump and this lawyer were pushing Pence that they needed to go along with the scheme to overthrow [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=700.96s)]
*  the government. He had a two-hour meeting with this Trump lawyer the following day who was trying to [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=705.52s)]
*  convey instructions, specific instructions for Vice President Pence to follow, to throw out all the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=712.0s)]
*  Biden electors, to overthrow the government, to overturn the election. Gregory Jacob, as Pence's [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=716.96s)]
*  chief counsel, he just has this interesting window into what Trump's allies were thinking and arguing [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=723.12s)]
*  for in real time while the attack was in its final planning stages and while it was underway. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=729.76s)]
*  Even while the physical attack on the Capitol was still underway, they were still pushing Vice [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=735.76s)]
*  President Pence to overturn the election. Even once it was over, they were still pushing Vice [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=740.64s)]
*  President Pence to overturn the election. And apparently, Gregory Jacob has a paper trail to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=744.96s)]
*  back all of this up, having taken contemporaneous notes on everything that the Trump side was telling [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=748.96s)]
*  him and what they were telling Vice President Pence to do. Interesting witness, right? If they [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=754.88s)]
*  could get him. Well, today, here was Gregory Jacob on his way to provide testimony to the January 6th [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=762.0s)]
*  investigators in Congress. He testified to investigators for almost nine hours today. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=770.0s)]
*  Really, which is a very long time. Part of the reason we know that, part of the reason that was [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=777.4399999999999s)]
*  confirmed tonight is because of comments from the chairman of the January 6th investigation, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=782.16s)]
*  Congressman Benny Thompson of Mississippi. I'm just going to play you this conversation between [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=788.4s)]
*  Benny Thompson and a reporter. This is my favorite piece of tape so far from the January 6th [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=792.48s)]
*  investigation and you're about to see why. This is Chairman Thompson tonight talking to a reporter [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=797.12s)]
*  and confirming that, yeah, Gregory Jacob did come in and testify and it turned out to be a long day [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=803.68s)]
*  and a big deal. Listen to how he sort of spools it out. This is excellent. This is from tonight. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=810.56s)]
*  Okay, how do you like it? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=841.1999999999999s)]
*  What can you tell us about the Greg Jacob testimony today? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=847.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's still going on. Still going? Yeah. I mean, he obviously is close to the former [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=853.28s)]
*  Vice President who you want to hear from. Well, you know, we're glad he came and obviously it's [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=859.28s)]
*  part of the work that we do. He's a great patron. He loves this country more so than [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=865.92s)]
*  other people who don't. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=878.64s)]
*  So, a lot of news there. A, got a deer. Venison's delicious. You should try it anyway. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=882.9599999999999s)]
*  B, also got the Vice President's Chief Legal Advisor in there and yeah, we're heading into [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=890.32s)]
*  our nine now. And in Chairman Thompson's words, turns out the guy is a great patriot. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=896.08s)]
*  As President Wilson was just describing there, more than 20 historically black colleges and [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=904.72s)]
*  universities now having received these threats in less than a month, including more than a [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=908.96s)]
*  dozen today. Joining us now is Congresswoman Alma Adams. She is founder and co-chair of the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=912.72s)]
*  HBCU caucus in Congress. Congressman Adams, I really appreciate you being here. Thank you [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=917.84s)]
*  for being here. And thank you, Rachel, for having me today. The first day of Black History Month [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=922.48s)]
*  when we should be celebrating and not dealing with these kinds of things. I listened to the president [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=929.2s)]
*  talk about the threat on his campus, but when we look at the threats across this country, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=935.12s)]
*  they are acts of terror, hate crimes, and yes indeed, they must be fully investigated and [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=941.36s)]
*  prosecuted. And clearly that's what we have asked to have done. I'm a product of an HBCU. I talked [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=947.52s)]
*  40 years on a campus. I have a grandson at Howard. I talked to him today as well. So, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=954.9599999999999s)]
*  we're very concerned. These threats are really concerning to all of us. And so our federal and [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=961.36s)]
*  our state law enforcement agencies must get involved. I believe they will. We certainly have [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=967.6s)]
*  had some conversations through my office with them as well. We're going to continue to follow this. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=972.5600000000001s)]
*  And every person involved, whether it's one, two, three, or four or more, should be prosecuted to [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=978.16s)]
*  the fullest extent of the law. You noted in your statement today, Congresswoman, about the adversity [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=984.16s)]
*  that is such a striking part of so many individual HBCUs in their history, the things that these [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=991.6s)]
*  campuses have gone through, the things that their student bodies have been up against, the way they [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=997.76s)]
*  have been individually targeted in some states and in some places over their long histories. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1001.04s)]
*  Have you ever seen what appears to be a coordinated effort terrorizing them all, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1008.64s)]
*  targeting so many historically black institutions all at once? I feel like I've covered a lot of [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1015.12s)]
*  news stories and a lot of political stories about students being disenfranchised and campuses being [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1020.9599999999999s)]
*  targeted and there being discrimination efforts. But something like this affecting such a big swath [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1027.12s)]
*  of these organizations all at once, this is unfamiliar territory to me. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1032.72s)]
*  Well, it's unfamiliar to me too. Like I said, I spent 40 years on the campus, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1037.0400000000002s)]
*  very involved as part of the bipartisan HBCU caucus with our students and with the CDC. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1042.96s)]
*  So no, we've not seen this. And it's a major disruption in terms of the flow of scholarship [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1049.1200000000001s)]
*  and education and getting the class and all those kinds of things. And the students are afraid, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1056.24s)]
*  and the students are afraid and they should be, and they need to be careful. They need to be [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1061.36s)]
*  diligent. If you see something, say something, even if you don't think it's much. But in spite of all [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1066.9599999999998s)]
*  of the external threats, our schools are resilient institutions and they will persist through all [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1073.52s)]
*  forms of adversity and they have. And I certainly appreciate Speaker Pelosi and Chairwoman Bass and [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1079.04s)]
*  everyone else and my colleagues will be joining with us to speak out against these despicable acts. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1085.68s)]
*  Congresswoman Alma Adams, one last question for you here and that is about the sort of federal [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1093.76s)]
*  response that I was just describing. We just heard from the president of Morgan State that there have [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1099.44s)]
*  been contacts with the FBI, there have been contacts with Homeland Security. Clearly there's [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1104.64s)]
*  a federal government response here. We heard from the White House press secretary today that [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1108.48s)]
*  President Biden has been briefed on the threats and is aware of this. Is there anything else that [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1112.4s)]
*  you think needs to be done in terms of the federal government response or do you feel like the [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1117.68s)]
*  administration is taking this seriously and putting the right kind of resources on trying to find out [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1120.88s)]
*  what happened here and try to put a stop to this? Well, I think the administration is doing an [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1125.68s)]
*  excellent job of doing that and keeping us informed. I think we're going to have to all work together. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1131.2s)]
*  Of course, we're writing letters and putting out petitions and trying to make sure that we [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1135.6799999999998s)]
*  stay in touch with these chancellors and presidents and our students so that we can find out what's [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1143.9199999999998s)]
*  going on, who's doing it, because terrorism and racism have no place on college campuses. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1150.8s)]
*  Education is a powerful thing and our students need to be educated and their education doesn't [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1157.84s)]
*  need to be disrupted in this way. And that's exactly what's happening right now. So we're [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1164.88s)]
*  doing what I think we need to do. We're all pulling together and being a support to make sure we get [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1168.88s)]
*  getting into this. Congresswoman Alma Adams is the founder and co-chair of the HBCU caucus in [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1175.0400000000002s)]
*  Congress. Congresswoman, thank you so much for your time tonight. I am sorry that this is happening. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1182.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm glad to hear that you feel the resources are in the right place and going in the right directions. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1188.0s)]
*  Let's hope for arrests soon. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Rachel. Thank you for having me. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1194.48s)]
*  Have a good night. All right. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=329L08eyD0I&t=1199.44s)]
