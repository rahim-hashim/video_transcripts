# Trump stunts on national stage cause headaches for Republicans dealing with local fallout, outrage
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g)
*  This was outside the home office of Republican Congressman Cliff Bents in Oregon this week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=0.0s)]
*  His constituents left him little notes. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=6.68s)]
*  They called them Cliff Notes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=8.44s)]
*  Get it? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=10.16s)]
*  Because his name is Cliff. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=11.16s)]
*  They stuck their Cliff Notes on a cardboard cutout of their congressman. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=12.44s)]
*  They say things like, support federal workers, protect your people. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=15.8s)]
*  The Constitution is worth fighting for. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=19.2s)]
*  Also, we want a town hall. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=21.72s)]
*  Don't hide out east. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=23.8s)]
*  Well, today, Republican Congressman Cliff Bents of Oregon did hold a town hall in his [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=25.96s)]
*  home district. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  The Baker City Herald newspaper reported that more than 200 people showed up, which is, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  quote, much larger than has been typical over the past decade when other members of Congress [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=36.32s)]
*  have held town halls. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=40.96s)]
*  Now, for context here, this is not blue Oregon. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=42.44s)]
*  This is a county that Donald Trump won by 73 percent. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=45.620000000000005s)]
*  He got 73 percent of the vote there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=50.16s)]
*  And yet the local paper, the Baker City Herald, reports, quote, audience members made it [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=53.3s)]
*  clear from their statements and from their reactions to both questions and Bents' answers [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=57.419999999999995s)]
*  that they do not support the administration. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=61.98s)]
*  According to that reporting, the majority of questions today were about Trump's executive [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=65.1s)]
*  orders and about Elon Musk and about firing government workers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=68.42s)]
*  Today was also another national day of protests, big protests in Boston and in New York City [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=73.22s)]
*  and in Chicago and in Washington, D.C., people who work for the federal government and people [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=79.9s)]
*  who support them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=85.30000000000001s)]
*  They're regular fellow Americans rallying to try to stop the gutting of federal programs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=86.30000000000001s)]
*  There were more than a dozen protests today specifically for university faculty and researchers [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=91.94000000000001s)]
*  who work on health care, health care researchers and faculty members. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=97.5s)]
*  This was Center City, Philadelphia, hundreds of faculty and researchers from UPenn and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=101.7s)]
*  from Temple University in Drexel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=105.68s)]
*  It was the same thing at Rutgers University in New Jersey and in Chicago, researchers [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=107.86s)]
*  and faculty from Northwestern and DePaul and the University of Chicago. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=111.86s)]
*  In D.C., outside the Department of Health and Human Services, scientists protested, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=116.58s)]
*  scientists whose work is funded by the federal government. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  And you know, a lot of these protests are happening in D.C. and in other big cities. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=126.22s)]
*  But because of the kind of leverage that we've been talking about tonight and on previous [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=131.74s)]
*  shows, I do think it's really worth watching what's happening in local press around the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=136.38s)]
*  country too, how they're covering from a local perspective what's going on in the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=140.78s)]
*  government right now. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=144.46s)]
*  Take for example, the Des Moines Register. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=145.46s)]
*  Look at this headline from yesterday, quote, Elon Musk's indiscriminate carnage brings [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=147.22s)]
*  needless misery to these Iowans. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=152.62s)]
*  Here's the Oil City News in Wyoming, quote, Valentine's Day massacre, unconfined throng [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=156.3s)]
*  of Wyomingites fired by Trump administration. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=161.62s)]
*  Also, this headline out of Kansas City, quote, Kansas City doesn't have enough jobs available [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=165.74s)]
*  for all the federal workers getting laid off. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=170.22s)]
*  And quote, Trump jobs perc- quote, Trump jobs purge hits Michigan, quote, why did the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=173.42s)]
*  president fire you, mommy? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=180.34s)]
*  We talked last night about how this has been playing in Virginia, where the Republican [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=184.78s)]
*  governor there is Glenn Youngkin. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=189.66s)]
*  He has just been tying himself into a pretzel. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=191.34s)]
*  Trying both to defend what Trump is doing and say how much he supports Trump while his [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=194.74s)]
*  state proportionally has more federal workers and federal contracts than anywhere else in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=200.06s)]
*  the country. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=204.62s)]
*  Youngkin promises help for federal workers, but defends Trump job cuts. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=206.5s)]
*  It's impossible to do both of those things at once. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=212.34s)]
*  And the local press in Virginia is well aware of that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=215.58s)]
*  They are not fooled. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  Local press in Virginia, based on what they've been running lately, seems to be totally [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=219.42s)]
*  aware of what Trump is doing and what damage it means for their state. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=224.73999999999998s)]
*  This, for example, was the editorial page in the Virginia pilot newspaper today, quote, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=227.98s)]
*  as a winter storm expected to bring substantial snowfall approaches, communities throughout [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  the region are making preparations largely thanks to the detailed forecasting done by [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  the meteorologist at the National Weather Service. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=241.98s)]
*  That's another invaluable service President Donald Trump and Elon Musk hope to dismantle. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=244.74s)]
*  Purposeless destruction that would make the public less informed and drive up costs to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=250.46s)]
*  families and businesses. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=255.06s)]
*  Having accurate, timely forecasts helps power companies prepare for outages and manage [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=256.34s)]
*  demand. It empowers governments to plan for disruptions and it helps families prepare [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=260.82s)]
*  themselves in their homes for the possibility of severe weather, a key component of public [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=264.82s)]
*  safety. We know to prepare for near record snowfall this week because the experience [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=269.06s)]
*  and devoted public servants at the National Weather Service told us to. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=274.62s)]
*  If Trump and Musk have their way, it would be the last such warning. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=280.46s)]
*  And again, don't take it from me. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=286.46s)]
*  This is the editorial page in a local paper in Virginia, the Virginia pilot. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  In Virginia, where so many people work for federal agencies, including the National [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=293.62s)]
*  Weather Service, the threat to the economy and the relative inaction of the Republican [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=297.3s)]
*  governor there have, A, made people mad, B, ruined a lot of lives already, and C, have [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=302.78s)]
*  also caused Democrats in the state of Virginia to step into the void left by these Republican [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=309.53999999999996s)]
*  politicians who can't bring themselves to respond because they're so afraid of offending [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=314.97999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump. No matter what he does to their state. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=319.73999999999995s)]
*  Democrats in the Virginia legislature have just formed an emergency committee to help [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=324.5s)]
*  address the devastating consequences of Trump's actions for the people of Virginia. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=329.5s)]
*  They are stepping into the void. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=335.34s)]
*  This is an election here in Virginia. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeOlewpPM5g&t=337.3s)]
