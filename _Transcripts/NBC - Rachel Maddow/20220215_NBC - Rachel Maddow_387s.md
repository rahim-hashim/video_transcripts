# Republicans See Early Success At Damaging Elections With New Voting Restrictions
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg)
*  Today is the first day of early voting in Texas for the primaries being held on March 1st. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=0.0s)]
*  This is the first election in which Texas will be able to test its brand new and highly restrictive voting law. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And already, those new ID number requirements are creating major roadblocks for Texans who would like to vote. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=14.0s)]
*  Harris County is the most populous county in the state, home to the city of Houston. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Already this year, Houston has had to reject about 40% of all mail-in ballot applications because they were missing a proper ID number. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  This is happening all over the state. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=39.2s)]
*  The number of mail-in ballot applications rejected from Dallas County is as high as 28%. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=41.4s)]
*  And the rejection rate is 30% over in Williamson County, which includes the Austin suburbs. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=47.9s)]
*  The issue here is not just that some voters are leaving this section blank or that they don't understand the directions. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=55.0s)]
*  In a lot of cases, the problem is on the Texas end. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=61.6s)]
*  CNN spoke with a Texas voter who tried to apply for a mail-in ballot. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=65.6s)]
*  She provided her Texas driver's license number like the new law requires, but her application was denied [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=70.3s)]
*  because the number on her current license didn't match the one Texas had on file for her, the one she used 46 years ago when she moved to the Houston area. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=76.8s)]
*  The point of this law passed by Republicans in Texas was to make it harder and more difficult to vote. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=89.7s)]
*  And so far, it appears to be working. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=96.0s)]
*  The top elections official in Texas's biggest county is named Isabel Longoria. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=99.0s)]
*  She says, quote, we are seeing in real time voters votes being rejected. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=103.5s)]
*  Joining us now is Isabel Longoria, the elections administrator in Harris County, Texas. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=109.9s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. Miss Longoria, what what are you hearing from voters as they process this new law? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=114.6s)]
*  I'm hearing a lot of confusion and fear. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=124.1s)]
*  Questions being asked of what does this mean for my mail ballot? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=126.3s)]
*  If my application gets rejected this year, does it mean it gets rejected next time? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=129.9s)]
*  What does this mean not only for the primaries, but for the general? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=134.8s)]
*  And ultimately, how can I fix this so I don't have this problem again? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=137.8s)]
*  And this is just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=141.4s)]
*  As we start early voting in person in Texas today, that's one of the big question marks for us election officials is what happens to those in-person voters? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=143.10000000000002s)]
*  Now, we're going to see the same thing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  To that end about how to fix the applications, is there a curative process? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=152.9s)]
*  Are there resources to help people fix these applications so they can in fact get mail in ballots? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=156.6s)]
*  Yes and no. For counties as big as Harris County, we actually have the staff to double up our call centers so that we can answer all the calls. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=164.0s)]
*  In January, we got 8,000 calls to our call center, 5,000 of which were just for mail ballots. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  To put into perspective in November for our local elections, we had maybe 5,000 calls for the entire month for everything. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=178.0s)]
*  So we're seeing an increase in calls, an increase in pressure from local counties to meet the demands again with those call centers, with our outreach efforts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=184.5s)]
*  But it's a layering of issues. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=192.3s)]
*  Yes, there's an online database to cure your mail ballots from the Secretary of State, but you have to put in both of your ID numbers to even get into the database. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=194.3s)]
*  So if you only have one ID number, you can't even get into the state's database to cure your mail ballot. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=203.5s)]
*  And so, like I said, it's a death by a thousand cuts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=208.8s)]
*  It's a layering of this, the new election laws, the confusion, the fear, the paperwork for the application or for the mail ballot, paperwork for curing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=210.8s)]
*  You've got to ask yourselves, are you really tearing down barriers to help voters or are you just putting up more roadblocks? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  One, I mean, it bears mentioning that it's not just Democrats who want to mail in ballots, right? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=223.8s)]
*  I mean, this is affecting Texas voters writ large, generally Democrats, Republicans, independents. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=228.5s)]
*  Is there a sense from the Republicans that were in charge of drafting this new law and largely passing it that they have made a mistake [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=234.0s)]
*  and that things need to change? Are they trying to devote more resources? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=240.6s)]
*  I mean, to what degree are people realizing the problems that they've created? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=243.5s)]
*  The big message I'm getting from the state right now is, well, it's a learning curve. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=249.5s)]
*  Just sit and wait. But unfortunately, when it comes to votes, there is no learning curve, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=252.7s)]
*  That is someone's vote being lost, period. That should never be a learning curve. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=257.4s)]
*  That shouldn't be said flippantly. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=261.6s)]
*  And that's my biggest concern right now is we election officials raised this last year when the election bills were being passed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=263.8s)]
*  These were the well, well, well predicted consequences of these actions. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=270.8s)]
*  And yet we're still seeing this, oh, well, it'll get better over time mentality, which if you didn't believe us then please believe us now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=275.09999999999997s)]
*  This isn't getting better. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=283.09999999999997s)]
*  This is something baked into the laws, baked into the statutes that we're going to see. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=284.4s)]
*  Yes, rejection rates now, but yes, leading into the November midterms as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=288.5s)]
*  You know, the more you try and take people's right to vote away, sometimes the harder they fight for. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=292.6s)]
*  And I just wonder, is the frustration being coupled with determination to get this right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, what what anecdotally can you share with us behind the frustration? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=303.3s)]
*  Are people doubling down on their efforts or are people in fact actually just giving up? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=307.3s)]
*  It's a really interesting question. First, we're going to see how many applications that we've sent back actually get cured. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=312.3s)]
*  Same with those mail ballots. How many people actually take the step to fix or cure their mail ballots? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=317.70000000000005s)]
*  And how many people actually come vote in person if their mail ballot falls through? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=322.3s)]
*  We're on just day one here. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=326.0s)]
*  I've heard from my staff that perhaps our in-person voting is a little higher than four years ago. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=327.5s)]
*  That's a hopeful. But I think for some folks who when we election officials were talking about the laws this summer and it seems so theoretical, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=332.4s)]
*  you know, oh, you're just fear mongering. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=340.0s)]
*  Oh, that's never going to happen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=341.7s)]
*  Now we're seeing the real life consequences. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=343.4s)]
*  And I'll say that wakes people up very quickly when you get a call from my office saying, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=345.0s)]
*  well, because of the state laws, we have to reject your mail ballot. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=348.5s)]
*  And they're saying, well, well, well, I never thought this would happen to me. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=351.3s)]
*  It is. You know, I think you're right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=354.3s)]
*  Yeah, it is happening and it is happening now in Texas. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  Isabelle Longoria, elections administrator in Harris County, Texas. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for being here and thank you for all you're doing to keep democracy moving. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjoWd8XgcBg&t=362.4s)]
