# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 15
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc)
*  For months now, reporters across the country have been trying to get answers from those fake Trump electors [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=0.0s)]
*  about who told them to carry out this multi-state scheme. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=5.5s)]
*  Here's what it looked like when an Arizona reporter put the question to one of that state's fake Trump electors. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=9.5s)]
*  Did you have direction from anybody in doing this? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=17.5s)]
*  Was it you, 11, yourself doing this? Or did someone give you advice on the manner in which you can do it? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=22.0s)]
*  So I'm simply, I was one of the electors, right? I'm not in charge of the electors, so you would need to ask the party chair. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=29.0s)]
*  How did you hear about it? How did you hear about the plan? Were you just told to be someone? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=34.0s)]
*  You would need to ask the party chair. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=40.0s)]
*  But you're the person who received the call. You showed up, right? How did you know to show up that day? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=42.0s)]
*  So as I said, you can go ahead and ask the party chair the logistics of it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=47.0s)]
*  Ask her how you got a phone call to go somewhere? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=50.5s)]
*  You're welcome to talk to them about the logistics. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=52.5s)]
*  Do you not know how you arrived at a place? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=54.0s)]
*  Thank you. I appreciate your question. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=56.0s)]
*  I really do not know how you got a call. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=57.5s)]
*  Have a great one. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=59.0s)]
*  You have a question. I was hoping for that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=60.0s)]
*  That was Arizona State Representative Jake Hoffman trying desperately to seem like he really does not know how he ended up becoming one of those fraudulent electors for Donald Trump. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=64.0s)]
*  Well, today we have unearthed what we believe to be some exclusive, never seen before documents, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=74.5s)]
*  ones showing just how involved in the scheme State Representative Jake Hoffman really was. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=81.5s)]
*  On January 5th, 2021, just one day before the attack on the Capitol, Hoffman sent an email to three White House staffers. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=87.5s)]
*  In that email, he attached what he described as a quote, urgent letter for the vice president and asked that a copy of it be shared with then President Trump as well. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=98.0s)]
*  Here is what that letter said, quote, Dear Mr. Vice President, I write to you on the eve of January 6th joint session of the United States Congress to approve the certification of the 2020 presidential election [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=107.0s)]
*  to request that you in your capacity as the president of the Senate and the presiding officer over the aforementioned joint session of Congress delay the certification of the election results and instead seek clarification from the Arizona legislature as to which slate of presidential electors are proper and accurate. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=119.5s)]
*  Again, this is the same Jake Hoffman who responded to questions about his role in the scheme by essentially saying, who me? I don't know anything about it. Ask someone else. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=140.0s)]
*  One White House staffer who received that email wrote back, Thanks, Jake. I have shared the letter with a key member of the president's team, which is something that might be of interest to January 6th investigators. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=152.0s)]
*  I should note we have reached out for comment to Arizona State Representative Jake Hoffman and the White House staffer who responded to his email. We have not yet heard back. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=165.5s)]
*  Now today, the January 6 investigators investigation has issued a new batch of six subpoenas again focused on the fake electors scheme. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=176.5s)]
*  The six include two elected state officials in Pennsylvania and Arizona as well as the chair of the Arizona Republican Party. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=186.0s)]
*  But two of the subpoenas were also sent to the director and deputy director of Election Day operations for Trump's 2020 campaign. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=195.0s)]
*  In their subpoena to Michael Roman, who served as the director of Election Day operations, the investigators wrote, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=203.5s)]
*  quote, the select committee is in possession of communications reflecting your involvement in a coordinated strategy to contact Republican members of state legislatures in certain states that former President Trump had lost [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=210.0s)]
*  and urge them to reclaim their authority by sending an alternate slate of electors, one that would support former President Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=222.0s)]
*  It appears that you helped direct the Trump campaign staffers participating in this effort. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=230.0s)]
*  Joining us now is California Congressman and member of the January 6 investigation, Pete Aguilar. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=235.5s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for joining us. I know you've been busy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=241.5s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Alex. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=245.5s)]
*  We have seen public reporting in the last couple days and today that Rudy Giuliani oversaw this fake electors scheme. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=247.5s)]
*  And today your investigation revealed it has the evidence that the director and deputy director of Election Day operations for the Trump campaign were heavily involved in this scheme. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=255.5s)]
*  Do you expect those individuals to testify and provide documents to the committee? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=264.0s)]
*  Well, it's a two pronged sword there. We want both the production of documents as well as their testimony. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=272.0s)]
*  That's what we've sought out of each individual who has received a subpoena. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=279.0s)]
*  That's our expectation. And so we will work with them to achieve that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=283.0s)]
*  But ultimately, this is about getting to the truth. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=287.5s)]
*  And we feel that these six individuals and those two who had an effort, who played a role in coordinating this effort with the states directly, have something to share. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=290.5s)]
*  And so we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to seek the truth here. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=301.5s)]
*  And that means talking to these two individuals and asking them for document production. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=305.5s)]
*  So you're optimistic that they'll cooperate? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=309.5s)]
*  Well, it's our hope that anybody who receives a lawful subpoena cooperates. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=311.0s)]
*  Although some clearly in the former president's orbit have chosen to take a different path with consequences. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=316.0s)]
*  It's always our expectation. And we will continue to work in good faith to make sure that we seek these documents and get this testimony. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=322.0s)]
*  Do you feel at this point that you have a firm sense of who is ultimately responsible for this fake electors scheme? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=331.0s)]
*  We feel that we're making significant progress. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=337.5s)]
*  But ultimately, what your reporting shows is just the depths to which this is gone. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=339.5s)]
*  And the silencing of millions of votes that this campaign official was asking these states by silencing these votes and flipping a lawful election. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=347.5s)]
*  That's exactly what they were doing. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=359.5s)]
*  And so to the extent that they were using the government machinery around them to execute this strategy, that's what we want to seek to get to. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=361.0s)]
*  How high did this go? Who was involved? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=371.0s)]
*  Those are the things that we feel are important to seek at this point. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=375.0s)]
*  And we feel that these two individuals, specifically within the Trump campaign, will shed some light on those details for us. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=379.0s)]
*  The Mesa County, Colorado, clerk, who Rachel has talked about before on this show, is now running for secretary of state while she is at the very same time under local and state investigation for allegedly orchestrating a break in in order to access critical election equipment. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=385.5s)]
*  Authorities say the alleged culprits copied hard drives and election data from voting machines with some of that information eventually being published online by the conservative website Gateway Pundit. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=405.0s)]
*  The New York Times reports that nearly two dozen Republican election deniers are now running for secretary of state across the country to oversee elections. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=416.0s)]
*  In order to counter this, one group is doing something about it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=426.0s)]
*  If you watch the show over the years, you've heard of the grassroots organization Run for Something. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=430.5s)]
*  The group, launched five years ago at the start of the Trump administration, works to recruit and help elect first-time candidates to state and local races across the country. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=436.5s)]
*  And since their launch, they have recruited thousands of people to consider running and elected nearly 650 candidates to local offices across the country. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=446.5s)]
*  And this year, they are going after election deniers, the ones who want to take control of elections across the country. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=455.0s)]
*  But they're not just focused on the big-name secretary of state races. They are also recruiting and supporting candidates for local election administration roles so as to box out extremists looking to secure those positions. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=463.0s)]
*  And here is why. This is from the group's 2020 plan. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=475.0s)]
*  Quote, these are the positions that will determine whether or not democracy survives past 2024. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=478.5s)]
*  Practically, local election administrators quite literally determine how elections are run. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=486.5s)]
*  We're planning for both wide and targeted recruitment, staffing up to run a cohort program specifically for these candidates and investing in support for folks both before and after election day to ensure they're ready to do the job and handle the pushback they might experience. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=492.5s)]
*  These positions have the bully pulpit. The people who take it can use it for good and to restore faith and trust in the system and build and bring transparency to the electoral process. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=507.0s)]
*  Or they can use that same bully pulpit to undermine democracy itself. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=518.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Amanda Littman, co-founder and co-executive director of Run for Something. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=524.0s)]
*  Ms. Littman, thank you for being here tonight. Great to have you. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=530.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=533.0s)]
*  Let's just talk first about how these election conspiracy candidates queueing on time travelers and so forth. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=534.5s)]
*  The ones who are running for election administration posts, how have they shifted your focus? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=542.5s)]
*  Do you feel like you need to offer your potential candidates extra support or resourcing or training to combat the misinformation that is out there as part of those campaigns? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=546.5s)]
*  We do. These candidates running for local election administration positions need every possible resource. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=557.0s)]
*  They're going to be going door to door talking to voters who are hearing from an opposition that is admittedly in many places absolutely crazy. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=565.0s)]
*  So they need to be armed with every possible tool that they can access, whether that's good data, good skills to run strong campaigns, money, support. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=572.0s)]
*  These races are usually very low and very under the radar. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=580.5s)]
*  We're going to need to bring them up to the level and make sure they have every possible resource. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=584.5s)]
*  Have you seen greater interest in running in the wake of folks that believe in time travel and lizard people? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=589.5s)]
*  Have you seen greater interest in progressives in terms of running and making sure these folks aren't elected to positions at the school board level to the secretary of state level? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=599.5s)]
*  Or are people scared of having to combat that kind of, in your words, crazy? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=608.0s)]
*  So in 2021 we had about 25,000 people sign up to tell us they want to run. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=615.0s)]
*  So we set that as a goal for 2022. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=620.0s)]
*  We have already had nearly 20,000 people sign up at runforwhat.net to tell us they want to run for office. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=623.0s)]
*  And we're barely six weeks into the year. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=630.0s)]
*  People are fired up about this, especially seeing federal legislation about voting rights fail. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=632.0s)]
*  They understand that to save democracy we need to fight for and win for it on the local level. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=636.5s)]
*  We know that you guys, your group is prioritizing school board elections. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=642.5s)]
*  Can you talk to us a little bit about why you made that choice? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=646.5s)]
*  Well, we have seen just as crazy people who are running for local election administration roles run for school boards. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=649.5s)]
*  This has been the priority for the Republican Party and the conservatives for decades. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=656.5s)]
*  Ralph Reed said 25 or 30 years ago, I'd rather have a thousand school board members than one president. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=660.0s)]
*  They understand that if you control what kids learn, you determine the kind of citizens they grow up to be. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=667.0s)]
*  We've seen that over the last two years with protesters and fights over book banning and equity and masks in these schools. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=672.0s)]
*  So we're going to make sure that for the more than 20,000 school board races on the ballot this year, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=679.0s)]
*  half of which are in November, half of which occur at other points throughout the year, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=683.0s)]
*  we are doing everything we can to recruit and support incredible candidates for these races. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=686.5s)]
*  Is there anything that makes it a different crop of candidates than previous years? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=691.5s)]
*  For us, these folks are brave. They see the threats that people are getting. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=696.5s)]
*  They see how dangerous it can be and they see what the opposition is and they are willing to put their names on the ballot anyway. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=700.5s)]
*  I find it incredibly inspiring to see folks who are going from person who cares to candidate to elected official to public servant [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=707.5s)]
*  who is really doing something meaningful for people. They're inspiring. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=714.0s)]
*  In 2014, some of the Sandy Hook families sued Remington, the manufacturer of the gun that killed their children, in a wrongful death lawsuit. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=720.0s)]
*  And that case might sound like a no-brainer, but it really was an extraordinary legal long shot. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=729.0s)]
*  That's because guns are unlike any other consumer product. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=736.0s)]
*  The companies that make them are protected by a federal law that essentially shields gun manufacturers from accountability [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=739.5s)]
*  after their products are used to murder people. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=745.5s)]
*  And so to get around that law, the families suing Remington tried out a new legal strategy. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=749.5s)]
*  They argued that Remington was improperly marketing their AR-15-style weapon to civilians. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=754.5s)]
*  The families argued that Remington was telling people that a gun built for military-style combat could and should [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=760.5s)]
*  also be used in everyday civilian life. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=767.0s)]
*  And as evidence, they presented these ads. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=770.0s)]
*  The ones that Remington said would make you a man. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=773.0s)]
*  The ones that were battle-tested, meant for combat. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=777.0s)]
*  The ones that were, according to Remington, good enough for professionals and good enough for you. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=781.0s)]
*  Their lawyer used an analogy in court, one that makes their argument incredibly easy to understand. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=787.0s)]
*  Can you imagine Ford Motor Company advertising one of their cars to go run over people? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=793.5s)]
*  Who would hesitate for a second to hold Ford accountable for that? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=800.5s)]
*  This case has been dragging on for seven years. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=804.5s)]
*  And today, Remington agreed to a settlement. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=809.5s)]
*  The company that made the gun that killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=813.5s)]
*  it agreed today to pay the families of those victims $73 million. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=819.0s)]
*  For the families of the victims, though, this lawsuit was never about money. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=826.0s)]
*  It was about accountability. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=831.0s)]
*  It was about getting some semblance of justice after their loved ones, their little children, were gunned down. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=833.0s)]
*  And it was also about information. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=840.0s)]
*  As part of any legal proceeding like this one, the parties involved are expected to turn over what is called discovery. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=842.5s)]
*  Put simply, discovery is any record or document or communication that could be in any way relevant to the lawsuit. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=849.5s)]
*  And so with this lawsuit, the Sandy Hook families hope to obtain through the discovery process some insight into how these gun companies operate [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=856.5s)]
*  and how they make decisions around marketing their products. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=865.5s)]
*  As a condition of this settlement, the families are allowed to publicize what they learned from the thousands and thousands of documents [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=869.0s)]
*  turned over by Remington over the course of this trial. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=877.0s)]
*  These are documents that Remington has fought tooth and nail to keep out of the public eye. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=881.0s)]
*  The families who brought this suit believe that bringing these documents to light will help prevent the next mass shooting. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=887.0s)]
*  One of these families is the Wheeler family. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=895.0s)]
*  Their little boy Benjamin was six years old when he was shot and killed at Sandy Hook. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=899.0s)]
*  Today, Ben's dad, David Wheeler, talked about how he hopes today's settlement will mean more families do not have to do what he and his wife did today. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=905.0s)]
*  We're standing here because Ben isn't. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=918.0s)]
*  He'd be tall. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=925.0s)]
*  Probably with tousled brown hair and probably lanky, probably skinny. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=929.0s)]
*  But as Francine said, he's six. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=937.0s)]
*  He's six forever. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=943.0s)]
*  Under a granite stone in Newtown Cemetery. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=947.0s)]
*  When you lose a kid at an age like that, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=953.0s)]
*  six years is not enough time to take all the photographs and videos that you need to last for the rest of your life. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=959.0s)]
*  One of the reasons Ben's not here is because some people made a decision [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=974.0s)]
*  driven by an increased desire for profits and a fear of a shrinking market share to focus their advertising on young men. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=980.5s)]
*  To sell them their product. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=990.5s)]
*  The most intentionally lethal consumer product our species has ever devised. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=995.5s)]
*  Think about this for a second. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1004.5s)]
*  Think about this for a second. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1006.0s)]
*  Does Honda market their incredibly powerful open wheel formula one race cars to young drivers, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1009.0s)]
*  inexperienced drivers, and tell them that if they buy the product they'll be able to dominate the public roads and highways? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1016.0s)]
*  Do they do that? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1023.0s)]
*  Do the makers of hunting knives and compound bows imply in their advertising to young hunters that they can turn those weapons on other human beings [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1025.0s)]
*  and that buying them and using them will bring them power and glory? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1034.5s)]
*  No. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1038.5s)]
*  But that's what the firearms industry did. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1040.5s)]
*  They behaved irresponsibly to make more money and their corporate partners turned the other cheek. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1045.5s)]
*  Today is an example of our system working. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1056.5s)]
*  An example of the process that while lengthy it makes it clear to the manufacturers of these products that if you want to sell them you must do it in a reasonable and responsible way. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1061.0s)]
*  And it makes clear to the banks who fund them and the insurance companies that cover them that there will be a steep price for irresponsible behavior. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1074.0s)]
*  Our son Ben didn't behave irresponsibly on December 14th. He went to school. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1084.5s)]
*  And now he's gone. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1092.5s)]
*  And we're here. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1096.5s)]
*  Because we want to make sure that another father and another mother don't have to stand here Sunday. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1098.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1107.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1109.0s)]
*  The Pentagon is one of the most secure locations on earth. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1113.0s)]
*  Even just to tour the building you have to make a reservation at least 14 days in advance. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1117.0s)]
*  Then you have to arrive at least an hour in advance to get through all of the security. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1123.0s)]
*  And the tour itself is led by active duty military personnel who never leave your side. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1127.0s)]
*  But Arlington Now News is reporting that somehow yesterday this bunny infiltrated the Pentagon. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1132.5s)]
*  The rabbit somehow got all the way to the courtyard at the very center of the building which is a crazy feat. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1140.5s)]
*  Pentagon is the largest low rise office building in the world so it's not exactly like the bunny could just hop over the side of the building. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1147.5s)]
*  And even those super secure tours that usually run through the Pentagon those have been shut down because of covid. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1156.0s)]
*  So it is not like someone snuck the bunny in the building. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1162.0s)]
*  Two weeks ago a chicken was caught sneaking around the security checkpoint area of the Pentagon. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1165.0s)]
*  Now the chicken didn't get nearly as far as the bunny. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1171.0s)]
*  At the moment we do not know if it was planning a coup or why it crossed the road. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1174.0s)]
*  The chicken was apparently winging it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1180.0s)]
*  As for how exactly the bunny hopped over the largest low rise office building in the world into its center courtyard. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1183.5s)]
*  The prevailing theory is that it was dropped by a hawk. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1189.5s)]
*  At present there is no reason to believe this is foul play. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1193.5s)]
*  But we will of course follow this story down whatever rabbit hole it may lead. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1198.5s)]
*  Thank you for watching. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o4x9sTICdc&t=1213.0s)]
