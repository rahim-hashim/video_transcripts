# U.S. Anticipates Russian Use Of Familiar False Flag Tactic On Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk)
*  This is a T-90 Russian tank. It weighs just under 50 tons. And this is what happens with a T-90 Russian tank when it gets stuck in the mud. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=0.0s)]
*  This video was apparently taken during military exercises outside of Moscow a few years back, and the soldiers operating it there, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=13.6s)]
*  they had to drive through a not so shallow mud pit, and well, you just see the images. The video speaks for itself. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=22.64s)]
*  The only way to free it was to bring in another military tank to pull it out of the mud. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=30.16s)]
*  And it turns out that this sort of thing, actually, the issue of military equipment getting bogged down in the mud, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=35.36s)]
*  this is actually a real concern for the Russian military, because you see every spring the frozen fields and roads in and around Russia, they start to thaw. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=42.64s)]
*  And as a result, as one would expect, the land turns into a sea of mud. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=52.0s)]
*  And over the years, the Russians have actually even coined a term for it, Rasputitsa, meaning the time of bad roads. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=56.56s)]
*  And right now, all of that is reportedly factoring into a potential decision by the Russian government whether or not to invade Ukraine. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=64.36s)]
*  The New York Times reported this week that U.S. officials believe the Russian president's window for an invasion is limited, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=73.2s)]
*  dictated by temperatures that will freeze the ground, allowing for the easy movement of heavy vehicles and equipment before a spring thaw, which could begin by March. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=79.88s)]
*  It creates a muddy quagmire. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  Now, the weather is of such concern that the Biden administration has enlisted meteorologists to look more closely at the likely weather in Ukraine in the coming weeks. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=95.08s)]
*  It's against this backdrop that we're getting further indications of a deepening crisis between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=103.92s)]
*  Earlier today, Ukraine was hit with a massive, massive cyber attack that targeted government websites. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  Visitors to those sites were met with a message that read, in part, be afraid and expect the worst. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  With, you know, and authorities here, you know, while authorities have not concluded that Russia carried out the attack, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  it is consistent with similar attacks seen prior to, you know, Russia's invasion of Georgia back in 2008, for example. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=128.24s)]
*  In addition, U.S. intelligence is now suggesting that Russia is preparing a false flag operation in order to rationalize an invasion of Ukraine. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=136.08s)]
*  A U.S. official tells NBC News, quote, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=145.44s)]
*  U.S. officials also accuse Russia of ramping up disinformation campaigns in order to lay groundwork for a possible invasion, one that would paint Ukraine as the aggressor, not Russia. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=158.24s)]
*  Russia was acting maybe perhaps in self-defense. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=176.56s)]
*  Russia also relied on a similar disinformation campaign right before its invasion of Crimea back in 2014, just as a way to justify that very attack. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=178.76s)]
*  To quote one senior U.S. diplomat, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=189.04s)]
*  the drumbeat of war is sounding loud. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  And so far, we should note that talks between the West and Russia have failed to de-escalate the situation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=193.72s)]
*  So what, if anything, can be done at this point? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  Joining us now is Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=202.6s)]
*  Ambassador McFaul, great to see you again, as always. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=208.56s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=211.44s)]
*  What do you make of this latest U.S. intelligence report suggesting that the Russians are planning a false flag attack as a way to justify an invasion of Ukraine? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=212.2s)]
*  Did U.S. officials put that information out there, you think, to try to stave off the planning by the Russians? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=221.16s)]
*  Well, first time, and thanks for reminding me about what the slang in Russian is, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=228.88s)]
*  slakhet, which is the mud that you're talking about on the streets when I used to live there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=232.6s)]
*  We used to joke about it with my family about that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=238.12s)]
*  But to your serious point, I don't know. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=240.84s)]
*  It's a great observation that maybe the U.S. officials put that out to warn everybody. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=243.4s)]
*  I think that's really smart, because as you just pointed out, in 2014, they did it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  2008, it was a similar thing when they invaded Georgia. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=252.76s)]
*  And going way back, I think it's important to remember when Russia invaded Chechnya for the second time in 1999, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=256.68s)]
*  there were several terrorist attacks inside Russia, and many people believe those were planted by the FSB, by the successor group of the KGB. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  I can't confirm or deny that, but I know in the intelligence world that was debated. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=275.36s)]
*  And most certainly, that was the pretext for that massive military intervention in 1999. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=279.88s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely incredible. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  I know NBC News has confirmed that the Biden administration is considering arming Ukrainian insurgents, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  who would, in essence, fight a guerrilla war against Russia should Putin invade and potentially take over a large part of the country [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=293.48s)]
*  where the Ukrainian military is unable to fight them directly. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  Is this a wise strategy, in your opinion? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  Could it be an effective strategy? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=308.56s)]
*  But is it a wise strategy? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=310.48s)]
*  Well, we're not going to go to war with Russia over Ukraine. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=311.88s)]
*  I want to say that very clearly, because sometimes people speculate we should... [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=317.44s)]
*  We're not going to do that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=321.12s)]
*  No other country is going to do that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=322.52s)]
*  So the Ukrainians need to defend themselves, and I support the Biden administration's efforts to help them defend themselves. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=324.4s)]
*  With respect to this reporting, I can't... [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  I've only read it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=334.56s)]
*  I don't know if it's true. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=335.84s)]
*  But we should help them defend themselves to the utmost so that it makes it costly for the intervention. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=337.2s)]
*  That said, let's have no illusions. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=343.44s)]
*  The good news is that the Ukrainian military is a lot better today than it was in 2014 because of training and new weapons. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=346.28s)]
*  But the bad news is the Russian military is a lot more capable today than it was in 2014 and much better armed. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=354.2s)]
*  And the forces that are on the borders today are multiples what it was in 2014 and not just in the East. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=362.6s)]
*  I mean, it's in the North, it's in the South, through Crimea. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=370.12s)]
*  And I think if there's a military intervention, you might see Russian forces coming from Belarus as well. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=374.2s)]
*  And I would remind you, yes, they have to worry about the mud for their tanks, but they also have long range artillery. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=380.12s)]
*  They have air forces that cannot be shut down by Ukrainian forces. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=385.6s)]
*  I think it would be a very tragic war if it were to come to that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=391.92s)]
*  I suspect the Ukrainians, of course, will fight, but it will be a very tragic war for everyone. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=396.76s)]
*  Let us hope that it does not get to that point. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  Ambassador Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=405.92s)]
*  Always a pleasure, sir. Thanks for being here. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oir1c6vEwSk&t=408.72s)]
