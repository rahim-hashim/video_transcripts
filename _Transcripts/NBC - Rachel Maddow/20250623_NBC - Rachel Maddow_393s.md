# Locals take a stand against Trump's immigration roundups, street snatchings
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8)
*  ICE out of Dena! ICE out of Dena! ICE out of Dena! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=0.0s)]
*  These Pasadena residents spent their Sunday protesting outside the AC Hotel on Madison Avenue [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=7.0s)]
*  after social media posts showed border patrol vehicles parked outside, confirming agents are currently staying there. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=13.0s)]
*  ICE out of Dena! ICE out of Dena! [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=20.0s)]
*  ICE out of Dena! ICE out of Pasadena! [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=25.0s)]
*  That was this scene in Pasadena, California, recently. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=29.0s)]
*  I mentioned moments ago that the mayor of Pasadena figured out a way to personally deliver life-saving medication [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=33.0s)]
*  to one of the people who's been arrested by Trump's immigration agents in his city. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=41.0s)]
*  When he encountered the man's wife crying in the parking lot outside the facility where this man had been taken, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=46.0s)]
*  he arranged instantly and on the spot to become the legal representative for that man, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=52.0s)]
*  even though he'd been turned away as mayor from getting into that facility. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=57.0s)]
*  As the man's lawyer, he was allowed in and was thus able to deliver the medication that may have saved that man's life. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=61.0s)]
*  But Pasadena has been the site of a lot of interesting protests and response to what Trump's immigration agents have been doing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=67.0s)]
*  That protest you just saw here from that local news package happened after local residents in Pasadena [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=75.0s)]
*  discovered that federal immigration agents had checked in in large numbers and were staying at local Pasadena hotels. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=81.0s)]
*  That knowledge set off a whole new, effectively spontaneous, and then fast-growing protest campaign by local Pasadena residents [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=88.0s)]
*  to get those agents to leave, to get them to get out of their community, to get out of those hotels. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=98.0s)]
*  And we have a lot of footage. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=104.0s)]
*  I can't play the sound here of exactly what happened at some of this footage because it involves a lot of cursing, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=107.0s)]
*  cursing in multiple languages. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=114.0s)]
*  In fact, I will admit that watching footage of this protest, I learned some new words. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=116.0s)]
*  But the protest was loud on purpose. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=120.0s)]
*  At times, it even included a band. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=124.0s)]
*  They were trying to be unmistakable and inescapable as a presence to annoy Trump's immigration agents and get them to leave that community. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=126.0s)]
*  And according to Pasadena's mayor, the one who got that medication into the local ICE detention facility, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=136.0s)]
*  according to Pasadena's mayor, this protest at the hotel worked. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=143.0s)]
*  Mayor Vince Gordo told, Mayor Victor Gordo, excuse me, told the LA Times that after hours of noisy rallying, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=148.0s)]
*  hotel staff asked the federal agents to pack up their things and go. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=156.0s)]
*  And they did. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=161.0s)]
*  And the resulting celebration outside that hotel was just as loud as the protest had been. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=162.0s)]
*  But I'll tell you, it had much less cursing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=167.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Mayor Victor Gordo of Pasadena, California. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=169.0s)]
*  Mr. Mayor, thank you very much for being with us tonight. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=172.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=174.0s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. Thank you for having me. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=176.0s)]
*  How would you describe the scope of Trump's immigration actions inside Pasadena and the response of your community? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=178.0s)]
*  Well, you know, the first thing that I'd like to point out is we know that there are armed men jumping out of unmarked vehicles, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=185.0s)]
*  wielding high-powered weapons at our parks, at our community centers and in our neighborhoods. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=193.0s)]
*  Or they're happening. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=198.0s)]
*  What we don't know is whether, in fact, these are ICE or federal agents at all. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=201.0s)]
*  We don't know that these are operations and whether we have a completely dangerous, different situation and dangerous situation on our hands. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=205.0s)]
*  It's creating a volatile, dangerous situation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=213.0s)]
*  Our police chief is making every attempt to contact the federal government in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=218.0s)]
*  to confirm whether, in fact, these are ICE operations. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=226.0s)]
*  We believe that they are, but we just don't know. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=230.0s)]
*  And they won't communicate with us. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=233.0s)]
*  And that can create a very dangerous, dangerous, volatile situation. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=235.0s)]
*  Imagine a Pasadena police officer being called in response to armed men running through a neighborhood or at a park or coming upon that situation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=241.0s)]
*  We could have a very serious and dangerous situation for the agents themselves, for residents, for kids in the parks, for everyone. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=250.0s)]
*  And that's unacceptable. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=261.0s)]
*  In terms of these recent protests outside of Pasadena Hotel encouraging agents to leave, they ultimately did leave. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=264.0s)]
*  Did your office or the police department or any other entity of Pasadena City government have contact with the Department of Homeland Security or the federal government around that protest and that eventuality when those agents all left? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=271.0s)]
*  No, that's the terrible piece. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=284.0s)]
*  There's no communication. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=288.0s)]
*  There's absolutely no, there's certainly no coordination. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=291.0s)]
*  But there's no communication. And that's the dangerous and volatile situation that's being created in our city. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=294.0s)]
*  People are living in fear. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=300.0s)]
*  People are working in fear. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=302.0s)]
*  People are staying home. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=303.0s)]
*  There's also that economic impact to our city. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=305.0s)]
*  So fear is not acceptable. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=308.0s)]
*  And certainly these, what we consider to be violations of due process and creation of dangerous situations are not acceptable. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=310.0s)]
*  But our businesses, I'm getting most calls from businesses saying, can you tell our workers it's okay to come in? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=319.0s)]
*  You know, there are workers who are here lawfully, as I am, I'm a former immigrant. I'm mayor of this city. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=326.0s)]
*  And, you know, the stigmatization of one people in our community throughout the country of Latinos and people of Latino descent is just wrong. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=334.0s)]
*  Victor Gordo, the mayor of beautiful Pasadena, California, one of my favorite places in the great state of California. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=347.0s)]
*  I've got a lot of family ties there. It's one of my favorite places to visit. It's a great town. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=355.0s)]
*  Thank you for talking to us about what's happening there tonight. We look forward to having you back, sir. Appreciate it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=359.0s)]
*  Let's be safe. And but let's express our opinion. No, make it known in the greatest of American ways with our voice. Thank you. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=363.0s)]
*  God bless you, Mr. Mayor. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=372.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMs2X27V2-8&t=393.0s)]
