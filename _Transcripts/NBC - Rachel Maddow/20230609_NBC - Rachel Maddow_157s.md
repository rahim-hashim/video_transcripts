Video Description: Rachel Maddow points out that while the federal indictment of Donald Trump does not explicitly reveal what intelligence was put at risk by his reckless retention of classified documents, U.S. allies around the world can see that the intelligence they share with the U.S. has not been protected. The Trump documents scandal has informed the rest of the world, "We can't handle our stuff."

# Maddow: 'The harm is done,' Trump shattered U.S. reputation for protecting allies' intel
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY)
*  Yeah, on the point of what he endangered, that's exactly what I've been thinking about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=0.0s)]
*  through this whole discussion, which is, you know, we don't have an explicit explanation [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=4.76s)]
*  in the text of the indictment about what harm was done to U.S. national security by his [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=10.44s)]
*  alleged, you know, handling of these documents and disclosure of these documents to people [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=16.72s)]
*  who didn't have the clearance to see them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  But we also, if you kind of step back from it, you can imagine the harm that is done [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  just by our allies around the world now knowing that this incredibly secret information that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=29.24s)]
*  they have shared with us or that they have co-developed with us, stuff that is only cleared [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=38.0s)]
*  to be seen by the Five Eyes countries that involved in that intelligence pact, our allies [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=41.92s)]
*  around the world know that in the United States, their very sensitive documents and information [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=48.28s)]
*  have not been protected. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=55.76s)]
*  They have been kept in a bathroom with an inexplicable toilet chandelier at a private [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=57.08s)]
*  club in Florida. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=62.4s)]
*  They've been parked on a stage in a ballroom. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=63.8s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about more than 300 documents classified, almost all of which [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=66.52s)]
*  involve important equities from other countries, including countries in which we have close [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=72.08s)]
*  working intelligence relationships that depend on them trusting us to be able to handle our [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  stuff, and we can't handle our stuff. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=81.4s)]
*  The thing that we all read on page 15 and 16 of the indictment where we've got this [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=84.44s)]
*  apparent recording of Trump talking about a document, a recorded meeting where he's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  showing classified information to a writer and to a staffer and all these people who [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=97.12s)]
*  are not allowed to see it, he says, look, all sorts of stuff, pages long, it's highly [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=101.12s)]
*  confidential, secret. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  This is secret information. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=107.32s)]
*  Look, look at this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=108.72s)]
*  It's like a child coming in from playing outside being like, look, mommy, plutonium. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=110.36s)]
*  It fell out of a box and it said radioactive on it, but we've all been playing with it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=115.12s)]
*  Look, look, just the horror that this stuff is out there. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  The harm is done. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=123.56s)]
*  Our national security reputation, our ability to continue to work with our allies who need [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=125.4s)]
*  us to be trustworthy is harmed by what Donald Trump has allegedly done. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf0UFcazmWY&t=129.86s)]
