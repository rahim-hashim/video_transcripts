# Combat training for election workers? Arizona braces for Trump-addled election deniers
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg)
*  You are being served. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=0.0s)]
*  This is where election denialism hits the road. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=2.72s)]
*  This is what it looks like in real life. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=6.68s)]
*  You can see in the video how the Maricopa supervisors, they hustle out pretty quickly. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=7.88s)]
*  Law enforcement blocks these people who are yelling at them and jostling them. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=11.88s)]
*  And if you're wondering what all the yelling is about, all the shouting about treasonous [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=17.28s)]
*  and you are being served, after the supervisors left, one person in the crowd laid it all [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  out. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  12 signatures, which means each individual person is personally liable for over $21 million. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=28.24s)]
*  Just from this paperwork, if they don't resign within three days, they will be personally [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  served with a writ of full warrant and an opportunity again to rebut any one of our [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=38.76s)]
*  claims, which I'm making right now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  None of them have signed a note of office. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  None of them are bonded to any of the people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  All of them are foreign invaders acting as government. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  They are not our government. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  Therefore, we will be serving them a writ of full warranty with a waiver of tort. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=53.24s)]
*  And if they still do not rebut we'll be notifying the military. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=58.24s)]
*  And they can be held off, hauled off, I'm sorry, to a military tribunal and I think [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=61.24s)]
*  we all know the penalty for treason. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, thank you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  We'll be serving them with a writ of full warranty with a waiver of tort. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  If they do not rebut, we'll be notifying the military and they can be hauled off to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  a military tribunal. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  We all know the penalty for treason. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, for what it's worth, almost all of them are Republicans. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=82.24s)]
*  They're all foreign invaders who are now liable for millions of dollars because somebody yelled, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=86.64s)]
*  you're being served. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  If they don't resign in minutes, the military will come and execute them. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=93.32s)]
*  And however this might look to us watching it on video, for the Maricopa Board of Supervisors, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=99.72s)]
*  having a bunch of people rush the dais where they're sitting, yelling that they're traitors [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  and they should all be killed, is scary. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=109.12s)]
*  Here's how the Washington Post reported it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=113.24s)]
*  Quote, the scene at the February 28th meeting terrified many county employees and others [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=114.8s)]
*  who were reminded of what happened after Joe Biden won the county and with it Arizona in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=119.08s)]
*  the 2020 presidential race. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=123.28s)]
*  Back then, Trump supporters used baseless claims of fraud to try to pressure or scare [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=124.56s)]
*  elected leaders into changing the county's election results. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=129.12s)]
*  After the 2020 election, you might remember this was the scene for days on end outside [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=133.04s)]
*  that county elections department when the votes were being tabulated. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=137.68s)]
*  There are mobs of often armed Trump supporters gathering outside the building, yelling at [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=140.4s)]
*  the election workers inside. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=146.4s)]
*  At one point, they surrounded one elections worker outside the building. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=147.72s)]
*  The person had to be pulled out of the angry crowd by a sheriff's deputy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=151.08s)]
*  Arizona has been a hotbed of election denialism ever since, as epitomized by the circus of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  that bizarre arena audit of the 2020 election. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=162.4s)]
*  The state's attorney general is closing in on a decision now whether to criminally charge [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=170.16s)]
*  the fake electors from Arizona who signed forged documents after the 2020 election claiming [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=174.18s)]
*  that Trump had won the state rather than Biden. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=179.0s)]
*  Just today, a man was sentenced to two and a half years in federal prison for making [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=182.28s)]
*  repeated death threats in 2022 against Katie Hobbs, who was then Arizona's top elections [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=186.02s)]
*  official and is now governor. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=191.3s)]
*  The head of the U.S. Justice Department's elections threat task force had a press conference [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=193.70000000000002s)]
*  in Phoenix today after that sentencing to drive home the message that threats against [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=197.86s)]
*  election officials will not be tolerated. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  They will be prosecuted and you will go to prison. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=204.10000000000002s)]
*  Quote, in training poll workers for this year's presidential election, the office of Arizona [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=206.5s)]
*  secretary of state Adrian Fontes is preparing them for a series of worst case scenarios, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  leading combat, coordinating active shooter drills for election workers, sending kits [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=216.74s)]
*  to county election offices that include tourniquets to stem bleeding, devices to barricade doors, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  hammers to break glass windows. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=229.78s)]
*  Arizona has been ground zero for election denial and threats and intimidation of election [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=232.46s)]
*  workers ever since the 2020 election. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  Things do not seem to be getting better ahead of this next election, but this time at least [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=239.34s)]
*  state officials do know a lot more about what they're up against. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=242.66000000000003s)]
*  Joining us now is Arizona secretary of state Adrian Fontes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=245.88s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  I appreciate your time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=250.72s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel, for having me. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  Is it fair to say that things aren't better since 2020 in Arizona and that as we head [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=255.26s)]
*  toward this next election, you're expecting to see a continuation or maybe even a worsening [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=261.14s)]
*  of some of the sorts of threats and sort of craziness that we saw in Arizona a few years ago? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=265.56s)]
*  Well, I think in balance, things are actually better. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  Our elections officials are much better trained. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=275.79999999999995s)]
*  They're more prepared. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=277.08s)]
*  We know what to expect for the most part. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=278.52s)]
*  There are some new emerging wrinkles, but we've been here. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=281.02s)]
*  We've seen that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=284.96s)]
*  And those pictures you showed of those armed crowds outside of the warehouse, that was [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=285.96s)]
*  my warehouse. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=289.9s)]
*  That was my election in Maricopa County in 2020. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=290.9s)]
*  We got through that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  We got through 2022. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  We will get past 2024 and we will protect democracy. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=296.28s)]
*  Tell me some of the specifics of your planning. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=301.2s)]
*  This is obviously a threatening environment, not just in terms of physical safety for you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=304.84s)]
*  and your staff, but in terms of making sure the election can be carried out without being [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=308.52s)]
*  hindered by external forces. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=313.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, well, first, the background. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=315.82s)]
*  We've lost senior election officials in 12 out of our 15 counties here in Arizona. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=318.5s)]
*  But to shore up the load, we are making sure that everybody who is coming in, most of whom [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=323.9s)]
*  were already in elections at the sort of the next level down positions, that they're prepared. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=329.7s)]
*  And we're focusing on the fundamentals. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=334.82s)]
*  But we're also adding in some augmented training, including some AI training like we had at [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=336.5s)]
*  a recent tabletop exercise. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=340.98s)]
*  That's training that law enforcement and the military used to sort of role play, throw [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=342.7s)]
*  scenarios out there. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=347.06s)]
*  We've also got some tiger teams from our office that are going out to make sure that our IT [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=348.64s)]
*  security systems are locked down, that folks are well trained. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=353.98s)]
*  And we have worked directly with the Department of Homeland Security, both at the state and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=357.54s)]
*  federal level, and CISA to shore up all of our physical and cybersecurity needs. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=361.5s)]
*  But at the end of the day, it is fundamentals, fundamentals, fundamentals. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=368.26s)]
*  And the folks who are running elections in Arizona are ready. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=371.26s)]
*  I know that the Justice Department had a press conference today in Arizona in Phoenix after [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=375.38s)]
*  the sentencing of a man sentenced to more than two years in federal prison after threatening [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=380.34s)]
*  your predecessor, who's now the governor of the state. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=384.88s)]
*  Are do you feel like the criminal law part of this? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=388.28s)]
*  Obviously, threats and intimidation are always illegal, let alone violence itself. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=392.36s)]
*  Do you feel like on the criminal law side of this that Arizona is doing a good job at [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=397.64s)]
*  prosecuting the stuff and that you have the support that you need from the federal Justice [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=402.64s)]
*  Department to do what needs to be done? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=405.88s)]
*  Well, I've been openly critical of the Department of Justice and the FBI for not celebrating [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=409.24s)]
*  their wins in the courtroom enough to act as a deterrent against this sort of thing. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=413.32s)]
*  And it looks like they're coming around a little bit. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=417.48s)]
*  The press conference today really does show that accountability matters. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=419.28s)]
*  And it's important that we let folks know that threats or violence against elections [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=424.28s)]
*  officials look at the end of the day, that's domestic terrorism. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=429.44s)]
*  Threats or violence for a political outcome is terrorism. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=432.12s)]
*  And that's just what's happening in America today. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=435.24s)]
*  It's inexcusable. And law enforcement at the federal and state level needs to step up not [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avzK9xZ8Weg&t=437.4s)]
