# Trump's Policy Of Giving Putin Everything He Wants Was No Help To Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw)
*  In the summer of 2016, at the Republican National Convention that was preparing to nominate Donald Trump to be the GOP candidate for president, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=0.0s)]
*  the Republican Party suddenly and inexplicably changed its long-standing policy platform on the issue of Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=8.0s)]
*  The two countries had been fighting each other in a simmering conflict for the previous two years, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=16.0s)]
*  ever since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and began supporting Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=21.0s)]
*  That summer, in 2016, the Republican Party officially renounced support for arming Ukraine in that fight against Russia. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=28.0s)]
*  One RNC delegate said it was Trump himself who directed that change in the platform. It was such a weird, specific thing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=37.0s)]
*  But it was just the beginning. We soon learned that Trump campaign officials were entertaining at least two different proposals to hand over Ukrainian territory to Russia. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=45.0s)]
*  The Mueller investigation found that Trump campaign chair, who before taking the job with Trump for free, had worked for Ukraine's deposed pro-Russian autocrat, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=54.0s)]
*  had multiple discussions with a Russian intelligence officer about a so-called Ukraine peace plan. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=64.0s)]
*  Trump's campaign chair himself admitted the plan was a backdoor means for Russia to control eastern Ukraine. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=71.0s)]
*  Another so-called peace plan was delivered to the desk of President Trump's national security adviser during his first month in office, hand-delivered by Donald Trump's personal lawyer. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=78.0s)]
*  Imagine that. It too proposed handing over eastern Ukraine and lifting sanctions on Russia for having invaded Crimea. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=90.0s)]
*  So you see, if you give Putin everything he wants, voila, you shall have peace. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=97.0s)]
*  As soon as Trump took office in 2017, his administration actually set about secretly trying to lift sanctions on Russia until Congress found out about it and blocked it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=103.0s)]
*  Trump then threatened to veto a bill sanctioning Russia for meddling in the 2016 election. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=113.0s)]
*  He only grudgingly signed it because Congress passed it by big bipartisan veto proof margins. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=119.0s)]
*  Then he eagerly set up a summit in Helsinki with Vladimir Putin, where he stood next to the Russian leader and sided with him over American intelligence agencies on the issue of that very Russian election meddling. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=127.0s)]
*  Trump spent his whole term in office disparaging NATO, yelling at our allies, advocating for Putin to be invited back to world meetings from which he had been barred specifically because he had invaded Ukraine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=141.0s)]
*  Oh, right. And he was actually impeached for a scheme in which he suspended American aid to Ukraine, ousted the American ambassador there and generally isolated and threatened the Ukrainian government. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=155.0s)]
*  So today, when Donald Trump put out a statement saying, quote, I know Vladimir Putin very well, and he would never have done this during the Trump administration. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=168.0s)]
*  What he is doing now. No way. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=178.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, let's just take a moment to stop spit laughing your beverage through your nose. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=181.0s)]
*  Second of all, why was Putin Why would Putin have invaded Ukraine back then anyway when he had so many irons in the fire in the Trump administration so many potential ways to get Ukraine to capitulate without actively invading ways that the American president, Donald Trump was helping him with [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=188.0s)]
*  This apparent new line from Trump and his allies that Putin was too intimidated by strong, virile Donald Trump to dare invade Ukraine while he was president. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=204.0s)]
*  Numerous congressional Republicans are now claiming that Putin is invading Ukraine now because Joe Biden is weak. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=214.0s)]
*  Not like Donald Trump who stands up to Putin. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=221.0s)]
*  In fact, here is Donald Trump just this afternoon on right wing radio, demonstrating his toughness with Putin. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=224.0s)]
*  I went in yesterday and there was a television screen and I said, This is genius. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=233.0s)]
*  Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine of Ukraine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=238.0s)]
*  Putin declares it as independent. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=244.0s)]
*  Oh, that's wonderful. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=247.0s)]
*  So Putin is now saying it's independent. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=249.0s)]
*  A large section of Ukraine. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=252.0s)]
*  I said, How smart is that? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=254.0s)]
*  And he's going to go in and be a peacekeeper. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=256.0s)]
*  That's the strongest peace force. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=259.0s)]
*  We could use that on our southern border. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=261.0s)]
*  That's the strongest peace force I've ever seen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=263.0s)]
*  There were more army tanks than I've ever seen. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=265.0s)]
*  They're going to keep peace. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=267.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=268.0s)]
*  You got to say that's pretty savvy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=269.0s)]
*  It's pretty savvy. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=272.0s)]
*  That is genius. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=273.0s)]
*  How smart is that? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=274.0s)]
*  Aren't you just bowled over by his toughness? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=276.0s)]
*  That's the former president of the United States saying today not only that Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is wonderful, genius and savvy, but admiring Putin's display of military might and suggesting that the United States ought to emulate it on our own. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=278.0s)]
*  Yes, Vladimir Putin must be so relieved that Donald Trump is no longer president. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=290.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser in the Obama administration. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=295.0s)]
*  Ben, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=300.0s)]
*  I mean, it's remarkable that these lies just flow as quickly as they do. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=302.0s)]
*  I want to get your reaction to those comments, not just from Donald Trump calling Putin's invasion of Ukraine genius and savvy, but the idea that there are lots of Republicans who are getting behind this idea today. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=307.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, well, first of all, we have to recognize that these comments will play in a loop on Russian state media and Russian propaganda. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=318.0s)]
*  That's already been the case with Tucker Carlson segments, with Mike Pompeo lavishing praise on Putin. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=326.0s)]
*  And that's certainly going to be the case with Trump. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=332.0s)]
*  And that's going to be an important part of Vladimir Putin trying to convince his public that what he's doing is not a massive overreach that is bad for Russia, but it's actually something that in the end is going to be a big part of the Trump administration. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=334.0s)]
*  And that's something that is a big part of the Trump administration. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=345.0s)]

*  And that's something that is a big part of the Trump administration. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=370.0s)]
*  Well, let's talk about some more of where this is going. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=401.0s)]
*  Donald Trump and his allies talking about how tough Trump was with Putin, that Trump [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=404.0s)]
*  wouldn't have dared do something like this while Trump was around. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=410.0s)]
*  Talk to me about that, because mathematically they're right. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=414.0s)]
*  There wasn't an invasion by Vladimir Putin between 2014 and now, but there's been an [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=416.0s)]
*  ongoing war the whole time in which 14,000 people have died, most of which was while [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=422.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was president. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=427.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know it's a completely absurd claim. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=429.0s)]
*  And the reality is part of what Putin was doing was letting Trump do his work for him [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=431.0s)]
*  in terms of dismantling the post-Cold War and even Cold War security architecture of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=436.0s)]
*  NATO, of the transatlantic alliance between the United States and Europe. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=442.0s)]
*  Trump was a wrecking ball in that space, and that's exactly what Putin wants. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=445.0s)]
*  And I want to take head on this idea that you could even argue that Trump and his [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=450.0s)]
*  weakness, at least, was preventing the kind of escalation that we've seen from Putin. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=455.0s)]
*  I think the reality is what Putin was waiting for and probably what he would have gotten [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=460.0s)]
*  in the second Trump term is further U.S. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=465.0s)]
*  distancing, not just from Ukraine, but from Europe and NATO itself. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=468.0s)]
*  And if you listen to that speech from Vladimir Putin yesterday and if you look closely at [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=472.0s)]
*  his worldview, one way or another, he was going to subjugate Ukraine. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=476.0s)]
*  One way or another, he was going to try to eliminate Ukraine as a sovereign country. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=481.0s)]
*  That's exactly what he told us yesterday. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=485.0s)]
*  That's what he believes. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=487.0s)]
*  If that was going to be made easier for him because the United States was going to hang [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=489.0s)]
*  Ukraine out on a limb, then he was going to wait and see if that happened. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=493.0s)]
*  And oh, by the way, if the United States distanced itself further from NATO, and you'll [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=497.0s)]
*  recall Donald Trump had to be dragged kicking and screaming just to restate the basic [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=500.0s)]
*  principle that the United States would come to the defense of our NATO allies. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=506.0s)]
*  With a second Trump term, what Putin could have waited for is a circumstance where the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=510.0s)]
*  United States commitment to NATO, or maybe even the United States membership in NATO, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=515.0s)]
*  was in question. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=519.0s)]
*  And once he had subjugated Ukraine, his capacity to threaten or try to control or try to influence [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=520.0s)]
*  the politics of further countries in Eastern Europe or NATO member states would have been [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=526.0s)]
*  enhanced. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=530.0s)]
*  So I don't think not only is it false to say that Donald Trump was somehow strong in standing [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=531.0s)]
*  up to Putin. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=535.0s)]
*  That's just crazy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=536.0s)]
*  That's absurd. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=537.0s)]
*  I mean, I think you had two eyes during the Trump years that knows that that's not true. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=538.0s)]
*  But even to say that this kind of chummy relationship that he had with Putin was somehow going to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=541.0s)]
*  avert what we've seen, I don't think that's true either. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=547.0s)]
*  I think one way or another, Vladimir Putin was going to do what he was going to do, and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=549.0s)]
*  Trump was just going to make it easier for him if he'd had four more years. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3bbf5Qa4bw&t=553.0s)]
