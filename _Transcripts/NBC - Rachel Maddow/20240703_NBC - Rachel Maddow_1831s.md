# Stormy Daniels on Trump, hush money trial | Highlights
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs)
*  Stormy, thank you so much for doing this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=2.4s)]
*  You do not have to do this. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=3.4s)]
*  I was very surprised that you agreed to do it, but I've been really looking forward to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=4.4s)]
*  talking to you for a long time. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=8.6s)]
*  I guess I mostly just want to know how the last few weeks have been. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=12.68s)]
*  This has been a many year saga for you, but this is a qualitatively different time since [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=16.92s)]
*  the conviction has been a few weeks. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=21.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's been a lot. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=23.0s)]
*  It's been intense. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=25.88s)]
*  I think that part of that comes from my mistake of in my mind thinking that this would be [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=26.88s)]
*  an ending. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=33.76s)]
*  That this would be the light at the end of the tunnel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=34.76s)]
*  This was what I was working towards. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=38.48s)]
*  That it would be like a movie when the judge hits the gavel, the credits roll, and it would [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  be tied up in a nice little gift bow and it would be done. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  But that's not how real life works. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=48.16s)]
*  And my friends were celebrating and sending me messages and texts. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=51.199999999999996s)]
*  Not just friends, but everybody. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=56.76s)]
*  People who were happy that the verdict came down and it was over. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=58.4s)]
*  But meanwhile, I knew that for me it was just getting started. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=63.76s)]
*  For every person that was excited and thrilled and congratulating me, there was somebody [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=68.8s)]
*  else that was very upset. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=73.72s)]
*  And it just poured gasoline on some of that stuff that I had been going through the entire [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=77.12s)]
*  time. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  And you know, it's kind of common knowledge now that a lot of people were doxed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=85.56s)]
*  I know that Cohen was doxed. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=90.8s)]
*  They're trying to dox jurors and judges were doxed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=92.8s)]
*  I was doxed. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=95.36s)]
*  And I know that it's directly related because it happened while I was literally still on [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=97.56s)]
*  the stand. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=101.36s)]
*  What's the consequence for you of having your address out there? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=102.36s)]
*  My mailbox was destroyed. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=106.86s)]
*  My animals have been injured. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=109.74s)]
*  My daughter can't go outside. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=112.22s)]
*  There's press and looky-loos out there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=113.34s)]
*  I'm afraid to go outside. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=118.06s)]
*  I'm afraid to go out and mow the lawn. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=121.1s)]
*  I can't go anywhere. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=126.74s)]
*  I'm afraid of being followed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=127.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=128.74s)]
*  The death threats are so much more graphic and detailed and brazen. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=129.74s)]
*  People don't care. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=136.02s)]
*  And it's scary. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=138.70000000000002s)]
*  And leading up to the trial was hard enough. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=140.86s)]
*  Flying up here repeatedly and sitting in the rooms and going through things and reliving [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=144.18s)]
*  all these terrifying moments. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=148.28s)]
*  The only thing that kept me going, I guess, was thinking that there was an end in sight. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=151.06s)]
*  And there's not. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=154.82000000000002s)]
*  Is there any sense of vindication? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=156.54000000000002s)]
*  Trump being convicted, this is not a case that you brought. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  This is a case that prosecutors brought. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=165.66s)]
*  You were brought here as a witness to testify for it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=166.98s)]
*  You were subpoenaed to testify. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=169.42000000000002s)]
*  You had no choice about it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  Again, not your case. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=171.62s)]
*  That said, the way the case was presented to the jury, the prosecutor described to the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=173.74s)]
*  jury in his closing argument, Stormy Daniels is the motive, saying how crucial your testimony [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=180.66s)]
*  was. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=185.78s)]
*  Your testimony was not only riveting, it was absolutely integral to the case. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=187.74s)]
*  Does the verdict sort of feel like a vindication to you, at least in the sense that the story [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  is straight now that the jury has agreed that he was wrong when he called you a liar? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=196.14s)]
*  Yes, but no. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=201.18s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  Life is not fair. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=209.5s)]
*  And I am getting constantly attacked. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=211.42s)]
*  It was called Stormy Daniels' hush money trial. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  And that's not what it was. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=215.42s)]
*  It was about the falsification of business records. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=216.42s)]
*  And mine was just one thing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  But I was the most exciting part. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=221.5s)]
*  And I was the one that took the stand. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=223.78s)]
*  I was the one that I think testimony made such an impact. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=226.26s)]
*  There were so many other people they could have called. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=229.26s)]
*  They didn't call Karen McDougall. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=231.66s)]
*  So as I've indicated, when he was found guilty for that brief moment, it was worth me testifying [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=234.94s)]
*  because at first I wasn't going to. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=241.1s)]
*  And I had to shut down my life. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=243.06s)]
*  I was basically my choice sequestered. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=244.78s)]
*  I didn't work. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=247.5s)]
*  I didn't tweet. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=248.5s)]
*  If you know me, that's a big deal. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=249.5s)]
*  I didn't tweet because I didn't want anything to be misconstrued or entered into evidence [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=250.5s)]
*  and create more work for the prosecution or get the case thrown out or just allow me from [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=256.22s)]
*  testifying. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=261.02s)]
*  Did I want to testify? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=262.02s)]
*  No. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=264.02s)]
*  You know how scary that is? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=265.02s)]
*  Especially once I got up there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=267.42s)]
*  If I had known beforehand how nasty Susan Necklund was going to be to me, I might not have. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=268.42s)]
*  But I also knew that if I didn't testify, that it would look like they didn't want me [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=273.34s)]
*  to and that I was not to be trusted. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=277.38s)]
*  That there was a reason that they didn't want me to testify. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=280.53999999999996s)]
*  So I knew that I had to and that it was important. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=282.97999999999996s)]
*  And as soon as he was found guilty, I knew that I had done the right thing in one aspect. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=284.9s)]
*  The other side of that is, like you said, I didn't bring these charges. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=291.34s)]
*  I didn't ask for it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=295.62s)]
*  I was subpoenaed. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=296.62s)]
*  So much of the hate mail that I get is, drop the charges. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=298.46s)]
*  I didn't sue him. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=302.78s)]
*  I'm getting nothing. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=303.78s)]
*  It cost me so much to come up here and testify. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=305.26s)]
*  I was not paid. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=307.97999999999996s)]
*  I'm a registered Republican. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=309.14000000000004s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=310.70000000000005s)]
*  It's just like, get out. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=311.70000000000005s)]
*  When you say you paid to come up here, you paid your own expenses to come testify. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=315.38s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=318.54s)]
*  Multiple times. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=319.54s)]
*  I wasn't compensated or written a check or anything like that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=320.54s)]
*  I got nothing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=325.1s)]
*  And this has cost me so much money. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=326.1s)]
*  I wasn't paid by anybody. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=329.1s)]
*  My testimony that I was subpoenaed, that everybody considers me to have done this great duty [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=330.82s)]
*  and be a hero, which I am not. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  I just told the truth. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  I was just a human being. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  I didn't do anything heroic. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=340.34000000000003s)]
*  I didn't go into a burning building. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=341.82s)]
*  I just said the truth. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=344.82s)]
*  And I've never changed my story, despite what other people said. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=347.82s)]
*  Go back, look at interviews online from 2019, 2020, 2021. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=351.66s)]
*  My story hasn't changed at all. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=357.26s)]
*  It's the only one that has been consistent. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=359.06s)]
*  Let me ask you about that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=362.02s)]
*  What you're saying was very much what the prosecutor said in the closing argument. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=364.26000000000005s)]
*  And I just want to ask you about the way that the prosecution, for lack of a better word, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=368.14000000000004s)]
*  used you, the way that you fit into their case. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=374.70000000000005s)]
*  Because I want to hear from you whether or not you agree with that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=376.46000000000004s)]
*  I want to give you your voice to say about it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=379.14000000000004s)]
*  He said, the defense has gone to great lengths to discredit Stormy Daniels on her account [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  of her sexual involvement with Mr. Trump. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=384.94000000000005s)]
*  They shamed her. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=387.34000000000003s)]
*  They have tried to suggest that her story has changed over the years. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  It has not, at least not in any way that's significant. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=390.74s)]
*  To be sure, there were parts of her testimony that were cringeworthy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=393.66s)]
*  But that whole episode in the suite at Harrah's, that was uncomfortable. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=396.78000000000003s)]
*  Some of the details about what the suite looked like, the contents of his toiletry bag, the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=400.54s)]
*  topics of conversation, those are the kind of details I submit to you that kind of ring [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=404.14s)]
*  true, the kind of details you would expect someone to remember. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=408.94s)]
*  If she didn't testify about those details, it would undoubtedly give the defense more [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=411.54s)]
*  ammunition in their efforts to call her a liar, to argue that she was never in that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=415.54s)]
*  hotel room. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=419.66s)]
*  Now, in his opening and his closing, Trump's lawyer, Mr. Blanche, told you that Ms. Daniels' [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=420.66s)]
*  testimony doesn't matter. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=424.46000000000004s)]
*  That's a bridge too far, because it's certainly true that we don't have to prove that sex [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=426.5s)]
*  actually took place. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=430.38000000000005s)]
*  That's not an element of the crimes charged. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=431.74s)]
*  But the defendant, Trump, knew what happened in that hotel room. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=433.70000000000005s)]
*  And to the extent that you credit Stormy Daniels' testimony, that only reinforces his incentive [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  to buy her silence. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=441.90000000000003s)]
*  The defense knows that. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=443.52000000000004s)]
*  Because if her testimony were so irrelevant, why did they work so hard to discredit her? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=445.14000000000004s)]
*  What I'm saying is that her story is messy. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  It makes some people uncomfortable to hear. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=451.8s)]
*  It probably made some of you, meaning the jury, uncomfortable to hear. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=453.8s)]
*  But that's kind of the point. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  That's the display the defendant didn't want the American voter to see. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=459.12s)]
*  In the simplest terms, Stormy Daniels is the motive. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=462.6s)]
*  That is why your testimony was not just an amazing display, but also American history, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=467.2s)]
*  the way that fits into this. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=473.34000000000003s)]
*  Do you agree with the way they characterized you in this case? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=475.16s)]
*  The prosecution? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=479.0s)]
*  The way that he's saying your testimony functioned and why it was relevant to this crime. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=480.91999999999996s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=485.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=486.08s)]
*  Why would I make some of that stuff up? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=487.08s)]
*  And you know, yeah, yeah, I am. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=488.76s)]
*  I'm comfortable with it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=492.08s)]
*  And for those people out there who were like, oh, they let her get up there and say whatever [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=493.44s)]
*  she wanted. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=496.64s)]
*  And I was, keep in mind, I did nothing but answer the questions. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=498.24s)]
*  I didn't go up there and present an essay to a spoken word theater. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, it was, I answered questions. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=506.32s)]
*  And if you don't want to hear the answer, don't ask me the questions. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=508.36s)]
*  And for those people who said it was uncomfortable to witness or to hear, I lived it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=510.88s)]
*  All you had to do is hear my very PG rated version on the stand. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=516.88s)]
*  I had to relive it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=521.88s)]
*  I had to say it in court in front of all these people knowing that it would be public record [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=522.88s)]
*  that my daughter is going to read this, that everyone is going to read this. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=527.92s)]
*  And preparing for the case, remember, I had to go back and think about all these details [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=532.36s)]
*  and make sure that I had everything absolutely accurate. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=536.1999999999999s)]
*  And it is important because it proves that I was telling the truth. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=540.1999999999999s)]
*  And I don't, maybe this is too far for our conversation right now, but for all those [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=544.88s)]
*  people who like to drag me about talking about what his genitals look like, don't you think [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=547.76s)]
*  for a second that I wish there was something else I could prove? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=552.68s)]
*  I wish he had a birthmark that looked like the state of Texas on his shoulder, you know, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  or funny looking mole. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=559.12s)]
*  That's the only thing that proves that I did, that he did take his clothes off in front [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=561.24s)]
*  of me. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=565.44s)]
*  And you know as well as I do that if he hadn't, that I was lying, he'd have whipped his junk [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=566.44s)]
*  out a long time ago and proved that I was a liar. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=571.36s)]
*  And it's the only thing I have. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=574.36s)]
*  And he knows I'm telling the truth, which is why he wanted to shut me up. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=577.44s)]
*  As soon as you were done testifying about what actually happened in the hotel suite, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=583.5200000000001s)]
*  Trump's defense lawyers moved for a mistrial. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=587.32s)]
*  And they said what you had testified and the detail with which you had testified about [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=589.6s)]
*  it was going to be prejudicial to the jury. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=593.08s)]
*  It wasn't related to the crimes that were charged and the jury hearing that was going [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=595.0s)]
*  to make them have so much improper prejudice toward Trump that the whole trial had to be [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=598.6s)]
*  thrown out. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=602.84s)]
*  And the judge said no to the mistrial and the judge said, listen, you shouldn't have [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=604.52s)]
*  said right at the outset in your opening statement that the sexual encounter never happened. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=610.24s)]
*  That set this case up so that the jury has to assess the credibility of Stormy versus [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=615.56s)]
*  the defendant. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=619.8s)]
*  Yeah, they put me on the spot. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=620.8s)]
*  And so they did that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=621.8s)]
*  But the detail of that testimony will be the basis of Trump's appeal. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=623.5999999999999s)]
*  He will appeal the decision to have not called a mistrial then. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=629.7199999999999s)]
*  That's going to be the way that he tries to get out of this conviction. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=632.7199999999999s)]
*  Can we go over that test? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=635.92s)]
*  Would you be willing to go through that testimony with me right now? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  There's no cameras in the court. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=640.1999999999999s)]
*  Nobody's seen it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I printed out that section of the transcript. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=642.1999999999999s)]
*  Is this weird? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  Do you mind doing this? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  I've done a lot weirder, trust me. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=647.9599999999999s)]
*  I'll walk right into that one. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=651.12s)]
*  When you say you paid to come up here, you paid your own expenses to come testify. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=655.12s)]
*  Of course, multiple times. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=658.0400000000001s)]
*  I wasn't like compensated or written a check or anything like that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=659.4000000000001s)]
*  I got nothing. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=664.6s)]
*  And this has cost me so much money. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=665.6s)]
*  I wasn't paid by anybody. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=668.6s)]
*  We're back to my interview with Stormy Daniels. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=671.2800000000001s)]
*  I want to let you know that Ms. Daniels was not paid for this interview. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=673.52s)]
*  We do not do that under any circumstances. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=676.84s)]
*  We also came to learn over the course of preparing for this interview and reporting [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=679.96s)]
*  out the circumstances into which we were going to be discussing these matters with her. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=683.96s)]
*  We came to learn that she is in fairly dire financial circumstances because of her confrontation [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=688.48s)]
*  with Trump, as evidenced by the fact that she recently asked a friend, a man named Dwayne [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=693.24s)]
*  Crawford, to open an emergency GoFundMe campaign to try to pay the attorney's fees that she [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=699.2s)]
*  has incurred and as she tries to hold onto her house. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=704.94s)]
*  For that part of it, I'm going to let Ms. Daniels here explain. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=710.62s)]
*  So the case that in which you just testified was a criminal case brought by prosecutors, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=716.0200000000001s)]
*  you were subpoenaed to be there just as a witness. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=721.82s)]
*  The reason that you owe Trump money is a separate matter. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=724.2600000000001s)]
*  Your former lawyer, Michael Avenatti, who is now in prison for defrauding you and other [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=728.5200000000001s)]
*  brought a defamation suit against Trump by you. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=733.5400000000001s)]
*  That case was thrown out and Trump was awarded attorney's fees. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=736.36s)]
*  And that totals, to make a long story short, it totals at about $600,000 that you need [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=741.3000000000001s)]
*  to pay Trump. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=746.38s)]
*  Correct. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=747.38s)]
*  And I was never allowed to give testimony. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=748.38s)]
*  They never saw my evidence. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=752.38s)]
*  It was never ruled whether I was telling the truth or not. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  So for all those people that are out there saying you lost a defamation case because [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=757.1800000000001s)]
*  they found that you to be a liar or untruthful is not true. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=759.86s)]
*  They never even looked at the case. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=763.7s)]
*  Other side of that is Ms. Carol, E. Jean Carol, was called the exact same things by Donald [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=765.26s)]
*  Trump. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=769.98s)]
*  And not only did they accept her case and let her take the stand and let her have her [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=771.5s)]
*  day in court, they've given her millions. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=775.0600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=777.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, my attorney's fees have racked up to over half a million dollars. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=778.66s)]
*  Do you have any means of paying that? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=783.34s)]
*  No. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=785.34s)]
*  And nor do I think I should. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=786.34s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=788.82s)]
*  In terms of what happens next, Judge Brachon just lifted the gag order. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=790.0200000000001s)]
*  So he's still prohibited from attacking court staff and prosecutors and their families, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=796.38s)]
*  but he is now free to attack jurors and witnesses, which means you. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=800.6800000000001s)]
*  When the gag order was in place, did you benefit from that at all? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=808.38s)]
*  Are you worried about it being lifted? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=811.1800000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=813.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's going to say what he's going to say anyway. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=814.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=817.3000000000001s)]
*  I'm not afraid of what he could say about me or what he could call me. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=818.78s)]
*  I'm telling the truth. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=824.5799999999999s)]
*  I'm the only one that has continued to tell the truth. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=825.5799999999999s)]
*  I can prove everything that I've ever said. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=828.26s)]
*  So I'm not concerned about those things he might say. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=832.06s)]
*  I'm concerned of him saying something that will make his followers come after me more. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=834.62s)]
*  Has that changed over time the character of the way people have come after you, the kind [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=842.4599999999999s)]
*  of language? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=846.12s)]
*  Has that changed over time? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=847.2s)]
*  The biggest thing is that they're not hiding. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=848.2s)]
*  They used to all be bots. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=850.36s)]
*  Now they're using their real stuff. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=852.76s)]
*  There's Facebook threads from people in my own community planning to do things to my [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=854.24s)]
*  house and my family. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=860.1s)]
*  I sent some messages over when Barrett was on another show and they couldn't even air [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=864.68s)]
*  everything they said, graphic details about how they were going to rape everybody in my [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=873.12s)]
*  family, including my young daughter, before they killed them. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=877.4s)]
*  Very graphic things talking about a child. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=880.4399999999999s)]
*  And most importantly, Trump is trying to make, I believe, trying to make an example out of [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=883.28s)]
*  me of anybody who dares stand up to him. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=888.56s)]
*  And he will, I was served again yesterday, sorry, the day before yesterday, and they [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=892.48s)]
*  were trying to take my partner's house. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=896.84s)]
*  It has nothing to do with me. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=899.72s)]
*  He doesn't even own the house technically. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=902.04s)]
*  It's got a mortgage. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=903.04s)]
*  The man who owns it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=904.04s)]
*  I don't own that house. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=905.48s)]
*  I pay him rent every month because I split some bills with him, but I don't own it. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=907.08s)]
*  My name's not on the title. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=910.88s)]
*  I didn't put any money down on this house. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=911.88s)]
*  They're trying to take his house. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=913.88s)]
*  They're demanding personal information about my 13-year-old daughter. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=916.8000000000001s)]
*  I refuse to fill out that form. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=921.88s)]
*  Identifying information about her. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=924.5600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=926.5600000000001s)]
*  Where she lives, her legal name, her date of birth. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=927.5600000000001s)]
*  Why do you need that about a child? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=930.2800000000001s)]
*  So I didn't fill out that part of the form. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=932.5200000000001s)]
*  I left it blank. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=934.2800000000001s)]
*  And they rejected it and sent it back and are demanding that I be held in contempt with [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=935.72s)]
*  sanctions and that I have to pay this money. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=941.0s)]
*  I have to pay $600,000 plus sanctions and be in contempt of court, which comes with [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=945.88s)]
*  a warrant possibly because- An arrest warrant. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=950.08s)]
*  An arrest warrant. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=952.6800000000001s)]
*  Because the things I said, which they found him guilty of, I also have to pay and I'm [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=953.68s)]
*  protecting my child. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=962.28s)]
*  And you could be the biggest Trump supporter, a woman voting for Trump, love him, ask that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=964.3199999999999s)]
*  woman, you going to vote for Trump? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=969.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=970.52s)]
*  Do you love Trump? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=971.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=972.52s)]
*  How do you feel about him having your young daughter's legal name, address, and identifying [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=973.52s)]
*  information? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=977.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=978.0799999999999s)]
*  And no woman out there, I can imagine, would give that information up. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=979.96s)]
*  They got my address and look how quickly that happened. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=984.6800000000001s)]
*  You think I'm going to give up the other address because sometimes she's with me obviously [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=986.6800000000001s)]
*  and sometimes she's with her father. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=991.0s)]
*  Why would I do that? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=993.44s)]
*  So there's basically two impasses now in terms of that money and the resolution of that defamation [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=995.44s)]
*  case and you paying the legal fees. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1002.84s)]
*  One is you don't have the money to pay. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1004.4000000000001s)]
*  The other two is they want you as part of that to give over that identifying information [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1006.08s)]
*  about your daughter and you were refusing to do it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1010.2s)]
*  And even if I had the money, even if I had billions, it's not fair. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1011.2s)]
*  Why do I have to pay it? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1015.5200000000001s)]
*  And I'm so happy for E. Jean Carroll, but like literally the same three sentences, like [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1017.2800000000001s)]
*  liar, whack job, like con job or whatever, she gets over 80 million and it costs me over [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1022.32s)]
*  600,000. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1028.72s)]
*  It's going to cost my partner his house. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1029.72s)]
*  It's going to cost my daughter her privacy for the rest of her life. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1032.72s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1036.84s)]
*  I feel like Stormy, the Trump movement has destroyed or tried to destroy a lot of people [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1039.16s)]
*  for posing a threat to Donald Trump or a challenge to him. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1046.76s)]
*  And there are, as you've been describing, millions of Americans, if not tens of millions [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1050.68s)]
*  of Americans who have a rooting interest in all of these various efforts to confront him [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1055.56s)]
*  and expose his behavior and hold him accountable for crimes or treachery or whatever. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1060.48s)]
*  But the rooting interest doesn't help you. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1065.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1067.68s)]
*  More than half the country is rooting for him being held accountable. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1068.68s)]
*  The people who are actually in the middle of these confrontations are being terrorized [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1074.2800000000002s)]
*  and menaced and ruined. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1077.92s)]
*  And overall, this system, I just, I'm sorry to sort of put this to you, but I feel like [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1081.2800000000002s)]
*  the system is unsustainable unless the real live human people who are willing to stand [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1087.72s)]
*  up and be counted and speak the truth against him are themselves protected. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1092.28s)]
*  You could be me. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1097.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1098.4s)]
*  We could all be me. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1099.4s)]
*  Like anybody out there. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1101.0s)]
*  They're trying to seize property of people that I care about that's not even mine to [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1102.88s)]
*  scare me. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1107.96s)]

*  And they're trying to financially ruin me and take money. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1114.4s)]
*  I'm, because I told the truth and I shouldn't have to do that. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1116.96s)]
*  And I've never asked for help before. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1121.76s)]
*  I've been fighting this by myself. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1123.36s)]
*  You know, even the people closest to me, my, you know, my best friends, my, you know, partners, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1125.8799999999999s)]
*  everyone else can take a break. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1132.24s)]

*  He's lived it the most with me, but even, even he gets to take breaks. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1137.84s)]
*  He gets to get on a plane and go home and take his kids and his family to Disneyland [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1141.08s)]
*  and not think about it. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1145.32s)]
*  I am the only person that every single day for the last six years, this has bled into [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1146.96s)]
*  my life. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1153.6799999999998s)]

*  Some days I'm picking pellets out of my horse's body and getting served papers and sobbing [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1156.32s)]
*  because they're trying to, you know, that I miss because I miss my daughter. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1161.84s)]
*  And she's not safe if she's with me sometimes. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1166.6s)]
*  And some days it's just things I read on the Internet. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1169.52s)]
*  Every single day, even you, I mean, you live this, you tell the story, even you, Rachel, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1172.64s)]

*  I just came back to that last week, but same thing. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1192.68s)]
*  The owner of the club got death threats. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1196.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1197.8000000000002s)]

*  But like how many places are out there that I don't know about that are afraid to book [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1201.44s)]
*  me? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1205.76s)]

*  I'm not. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1208.44s)]
*  I'm not like it's literally like between legal fees and not being able to work, especially [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1209.44s)]
*  because I wasn't working during. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1213.88s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1217.64s)]
*  So I had taken off a bunch of time before and then it got extended. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1218.64s)]
*  So there were several months where I didn't do anything. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1222.6000000000001s)]
*  I just stopped doing my podcast because they were freaking out about everything I said. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1224.3600000000001s)]
*  I didn't even get to tell the podcast company why I stopped talking to them because I didn't [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1228.64s)]
*  want anything I used to be internet and just create more work for the prosecution basically. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1233.6s)]
*  Or I didn't want to be taken off the witness list for all the reasons I told you earlier. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1239.28s)]
*  You know, there's so many things. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1243.52s)]
*  People being just afraid to hire me. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1246.48s)]
*  Luckily, I do have some really great people. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1247.76s)]
*  You know, I, I hosted the TV show and out TV and I'm starting to go back and, and do [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1249.64s)]
*  some standup comedy and things like that. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1255.2s)]
*  But I've lost a lot more than I've made. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1259.0s)]
*  Mostly my piece, mostly my daughter's privacy and time. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1264.0s)]
*  Time I'll never get back with her. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1267.92s)]
*  Given that, are you worried about Trump potentially being elected to a second term? [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1270.56s)]
*  Shouldn't we all be worried about that? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1276.0800000000002s)]
*  Are you worried about it particularly for you? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1277.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1280.4s)]
*  Why? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1281.4s)]
*  Because I think that he will make, try to make even more of an example out of me. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1283.32s)]
*  You know? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1289.28s)]
*  And also because people, his followers will probably be more, even more bold thinking [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1292.28s)]
*  if they do something, he'll pardon them. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1298.24s)]
*  In terms of his own criminal liability, he's due to be sentenced very soon. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1302.9199999999998s)]
*  You said shortly after the verdict that you thought he should be sentenced to jail and [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1306.6799999999998s)]
*  community service working for the less fortunate or quote being the volunteer punching bag [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1311.16s)]
*  at a women's shelter. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1316.44s)]
*  Do you still feel that way? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1317.92s)]
*  You still think that? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1319.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1320.52s)]
*  I mean, money is no object to him. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1321.52s)]
*  For somebody else, you know, take, finding them a bunch of money could definitely teach [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1323.44s)]
*  them a lesson. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1327.76s)]
*  In his case, his supporters just go throw it at him. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1328.76s)]
*  And we're talking about a man who got convicted of 34, you know, and, and they, in one night, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1330.8000000000002s)]
*  how much was it? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1336.8400000000001s)]
*  $100 million or something was given to him when he was found guilty. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1338.0s)]
*  Which I can be found guilty. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1341.0s)]
*  You know, like it's, finding him is not going to do any good. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1343.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1346.72s)]
*  I think, you know, taking away his control, slash, which is freedom, by a jail sentence, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1347.72s)]
*  if that's what fits it, would teach him the most because he's so used to being in control. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1357.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1362.12s)]
*  It's not about locking him out and taking away his freedom, it's about taking away his [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1363.12s)]
*  control, would be more helpful in this case, I think. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1365.2s)]
*  And, making him do some community service, especially with those people that he looks [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1369.68s)]
*  down upon so much. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1376.8s)]
*  In this part of my interview with Stormy Daniels, we're going to go through a little bit more [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1380.56s)]
*  of her testimony from the trial, but also her elaboration on that testimony, explaining [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1384.16s)]
*  what she meant. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1389.0s)]
*  The criminal charges that were brought in this case were brought because of the means [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1391.2s)]
*  by which Trump, the candidate, tried to cover up and keep secret and disguise the fact that [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1395.0800000000002s)]
*  he had paid this woman to keep quiet about this story. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1399.96s)]
*  Her elaboration here is important because what was it about this story that was so worth [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1404.3200000000002s)]
*  paying to keep quiet, that was worth the gymnastic, even baroque efforts he went through to try [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1410.1200000000001s)]
*  to cover up that the payment was made? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1416.6000000000001s)]
*  Here's Stormy Daniels. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1419.64s)]
*  Here's me, total prude, unable to talk about this, they've sponsored a hole and I had to [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1450.1200000000001s)]
*  keep saying it over and over again and it almost killed me. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1456.2s)]
*  That's why it's funny? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1458.96s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1459.96s)]
*  Now that you've ruined my comedy act, I can say it's basically like, so they brought myself [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1460.96s)]
*  and some of the other stars, they brought their own holes to the hole, so it's like [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1468.2800000000002s)]
*  bringing sand to the beach. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1471.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1473.3200000000002s)]
*  Well done, thank you. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1475.5200000000002s)]
*  You're all weak, try the veal. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1478.12s)]
*  So you had given him a DVD because Wicked had brought you and other people from the [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1481.1599999999999s)]
*  company to this golf tournament. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1487.12s)]
*  Were there lots of other adult film companies at the tournament? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1489.04s)]
*  No, no, no, we were the only adult film company, but we were in the gift room and everybody [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1491.76s)]
*  got to sponsor a hole. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1496.4799999999998s)]
*  See, I still can't even say it without laughing. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1497.84s)]
*  It's kind of genius. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1500.2399999999998s)]
*  It's inherently funny. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1501.2399999999998s)]
*  It is, it is. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1502.2399999999998s)]
*  It's very good. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1503.2399999999998s)]
*  So the DVD was in the gift bags and they had brought different DVDs of the actresses [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1504.24s)]
*  and that one particular was a movie called Three Wishes that I wrote, directed and starred [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1509.6s)]
*  in and he specifically wanted something that I had directed, which is why in my stupidity [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1514.6s)]
*  I thought maybe he really is serious about having me on The Apprentice. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1520.26s)]
*  Because when you met him at the hole on the golf course, you sort of immediately started [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1527.24s)]
*  talking about the fact that you don't just star in films you've also directed. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1534.58s)]
*  Right, the owner of the company was introducing everybody that was there. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1537.8s)]
*  This is my contract girl, such and such, this is my contract girl, such and such, this is [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1544.0s)]
*  the, our publicist, whatever, this is my contract star and director Stormy Daydahls and he was [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1547.44s)]
*  like, oh, so you're the star and you also direct. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1553.68s)]
*  And that's the basis on which you had continuing conversation with him about directing and [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1557.14s)]
*  about your role in the business. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1560.42s)]
*  And do you mean, is what you're saying about that, when you say, oh, stupid me, I thought [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1563.1000000000001s)]
*  that meant, by that do you mean his expression of interest in you as a director and his asking [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1568.74s)]
*  you business related questions about the industry meant that you thought that you were having [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1574.74s)]
*  a business discussion? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1578.74s)]
*  It was legit. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1579.74s)]
*  And why it wasn't a red flag to have a meeting. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1581.94s)]
*  Oh, well, you went to a married guy's hotel room. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1584.8200000000002s)]
*  What were you expecting? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1587.14s)]
*  Well, first of all, there's two parts to that. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1588.14s)]
*  One, he wasn't, nobody knew who Melania was back then. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1590.5800000000002s)]
*  I didn't know he was married. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1595.74s)]
*  I knew that he had famously been divorced from his wife before because everybody saw [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1597.0600000000002s)]
*  that scandal. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1600.18s)]
*  Did anybody in 2006 know the word Melania Trump? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1601.5s)]
*  They had been married just the previous year, but nobody knew. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1606.8600000000001s)]
*  Like, it wasn't a thing. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1609.42s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1610.66s)]
*  Famous thing. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1611.66s)]
*  I didn't know he was married until he told me. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1612.66s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1614.46s)]
*  Second, it wasn't a hotel room. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1615.46s)]
*  When people think hotel room, they think of the hotel rooms that 99% of people have only [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1617.1000000000001s)]
*  stepped foot in, which is where you walk in and there's a bed and a dresser and it's a [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1621.7s)]
*  hotel room. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1625.46s)]
*  This was a room that was bigger than my apartment and had a dining room, a living room, two [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1627.02s)]
*  bedrooms. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1632.1000000000001s)]
*  If you had told me that it was a hotel room and you didn't know it was a hotel room, I [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1633.3000000000002s)]
*  wouldn't think it was an apartment. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1638.26s)]
*  Those of us who conduct business at conventions or things like that don't think twice about [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1641.5s)]
*  going to someone's suite that has a conference table in it and a table. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1646.34s)]
*  People like to be, oh, you knew what you were getting into. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1650.94s)]
*  No, I've also gone to 100 other meetings in rooms exactly like that, that nothing bad [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1653.06s)]
*  happened. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1659.5s)]
*  Prosecutor says, this is almost the end, when you were leaving and you went to leave, what [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1663.58s)]
*  if anything did you do or say? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1667.18s)]
*  He said, we have to get together again soon. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1670.7s)]
*  He went to kiss me goodbye and I just left as fast as I could. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1674.5s)]
*  You know, that was it. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1677.5400000000002s)]
*  Did he say anything to you about talking again? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1678.5400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1680.74s)]
*  He said, we should get together again. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1681.74s)]
*  We were fantastic together. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1683.8600000000001s)]
*  I want to get you on the show. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1685.64s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1687.1000000000001s)]
*  He didn't give me anything. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1688.1000000000001s)]
*  He didn't offer to pay me or anything or a cell phone number, nothing like that. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1689.1000000000001s)]
*  Did he ask you to keep your encounter with him confidential? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1693.5400000000002s)]

*  Did he express any concern at that point about his wife finding out? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1697.24s)]
*  No. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1700.26s)]

*  No. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1703.34s)]

*  I told very few people that we had actually had sex because I felt ashamed that I didn't [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1716.3s)]

*  So I told very few people. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1731.7s)]

*  He turned it into a sexual encounter. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1753.66s)]
*  You did not want it and you did not feel good about it and you were embarrassed about [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1755.34s)]
*  it when it was over. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsU8ZQMuTs&t=1760.82s)]
