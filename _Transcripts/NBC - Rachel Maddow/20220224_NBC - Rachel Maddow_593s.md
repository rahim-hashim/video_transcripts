# Ukraine Supporters React As Putin Lies His Way Into War
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM)
*  And so far, Europe and the rest of the Western world has been quite unified, surprisingly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=0.0s)]
*  unified in its response to Putin's aggression toward Ukraine. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  If you were going to be critical of lots of things about the Biden administration right [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=9.84s)]
*  now, uniting the world against what Putin is doing here is not something that you can [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=14.8s)]
*  criticize them from. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=18.64s)]
*  They have pulled that off. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=19.64s)]
*  But it's not that it won't be challenged. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=22.84s)]
*  This mounting refugee crisis, which we started to see take shape today, it does have the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=24.32s)]
*  potential to destabilize some of that unification, right? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=29.96s)]
*  The strain of widespread humanitarian disaster, the need of other nations around the Ukraine [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=34.2s)]
*  crisis to adapt, to essentially come to the rescue, that creates political, diplomatic, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=40.4s)]
*  ultimately economic difficulties. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=46.24s)]
*  That coalition is mission critical right now for any chance of countering Russia's blitz [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=48.56s)]
*  through Ukraine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=52.2s)]
*  How do you retain that unity as we start to see these challenges build almost immediately [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=53.82s)]
*  as soon as the missiles started flying? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=58.98s)]
*  Joining us now is former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=62.22s)]
*  He was in that role, ambassador, when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea in 2014. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=65.86s)]
*  Ambassador McFaul, it's really good to see you tonight. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=71.17999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm really glad you're able to be here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  Glad to be here, Rachel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=78.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  Let me just ask you first for how you are feeling, how you, as somebody who's been watching [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=81.22s)]
*  this so closely, as somebody who has lived through a smaller version of this before in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=87.54s)]
*  terms of what happened in 2014, how are you feeling watching what's happening in Ukraine? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  What is your overall reaction to what Putin has done and what he's been able to pull off [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  thus far? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=102.18s)]
*  Well, my first reaction is I'm incredibly sad. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=104.42s)]
*  Rachel, I have lots of friends in Ukraine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=108.5s)]
*  Hundreds of people have trained in our various programs here at Stanford. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=112.2s)]
*  I used to go there often. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=115.22s)]
*  And when they started to attack last night, I was on various platforms talking to Ukrainians, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=117.42s)]
*  some of them now rather prominent Ukrainians in government and other places. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=123.94s)]
*  And it was terrifying to watch my friends react to what was going on. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  And for all the unity you just talked about, and it has been really remarkable unity that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=133.24s)]
*  the Biden administration has put together, one of my friends said very pointedly, I can't [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=137.74s)]
*  believe we have to fight this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=142.74s)]
*  And then she used a word I'm not going to use on TV. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=145.66s)]
*  It begins with be alone. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=147.22s)]
*  And Ukrainians are alone. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  Despite all those things, all the solidarity, at the end of the day, Ukrainians are driving [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=152.62s)]
*  to Lviv. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=157.18s)]
*  They're picking up weapons. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=158.3s)]
*  They're in metro stations alone. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=159.94s)]
*  They are fighting Russia alone. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=161.9s)]
*  So that's my first reaction. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=163.54000000000002s)]
*  My second reaction is anger. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=164.9s)]
*  I want to tell you honestly, I am angry at this evil act by this evil leader attacking [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=166.26000000000002s)]
*  an innocent nation, a democratic nation, and he's attacking them because they are a democratic [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=172.62s)]
*  nation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=178.22s)]
*  That's what this is about. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=179.22s)]
*  He is trying to undermine what the Ukrainians call the Revolution of Dignity. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=180.22s)]
*  Back in 2014, he has been angry about it ever since, Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  And he finally, and he said it very bluntly. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=189.94s)]
*  I listened to his speech. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=191.74s)]
*  He said it very bluntly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=192.86s)]
*  We're going to go in to do two things, one, to destroy the Ukrainian military and two, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=193.86s)]
*  to denazify. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=199.82s)]
*  That was the word he used. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=201.82s)]
*  Of course, that's not the right word. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=202.82s)]
*  There are no Nazis ruling Ukraine. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=204.26s)]
*  But what he means by that is he's going in to overthrow Mr. Zelensky and his regime. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=207.18s)]
*  And there's intelligence reports that they're going to round up and arrest and perhaps kill [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=212.64s)]
*  the people that were the peaceful protesters that launched that Maidan revolution, that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=217.28s)]
*  Revolution of Dignity back in 2013, 2014. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=222.58s)]
*  So I'm angry about that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=226.34s)]
*  The way you're describing that and those historical references, I think, to me, have been lining [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=230.38s)]
*  up in a way that raises one very big question, right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=235.24s)]
*  When we saw in 2008 when Putin waged war against Georgia, we saw him denounce the leader of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  Georgia as a Nazi. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  I remember they hacked the website of the Georgian leader, Georgian president, and put [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=248.3s)]
*  up all these pictures of him looking like Hitler, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=255.48s)]
*  They made trying to create this case that he's some sort of Nazi, just like they're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=259.16s)]
*  making that preposterous case about President Zelensky and the Ukrainian government today. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  You were in Russia as ambassador when he took an annexed, when he invaded and took Crimea [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=269.36s)]
*  and took other portions of eastern Ukraine in 2014. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  And I remember, you know, in 2008, I remember John McCain running for president saying, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=281.48s)]
*  now and talking about the unity that that brought, that the rejection of that aggression [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=285.96s)]
*  from Putin brought not only to the Americans on all sides of the political system, but [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=291.0s)]
*  to the entire West. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  I remember the international outrage in 2014 when Putin did what he did. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  And I remember the sanctions not only from the United States, not only from the European [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=302.32s)]
*  Union, but from a unified Western field of sanctions that really bit in Russia in terms [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  of making real economic consequences. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=313.54s)]
*  And yet here he is again. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=316.66s)]
*  And this time, maybe he's going to try to take all of Ukraine. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=318.34s)]
*  And who knows how long he's going to try to hold it for, if not permanently. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=321.1s)]
*  It feels like sanctions is the big idea from the West and the sanctions are getting tougher. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=325.46s)]
*  And there will be, I imagine, even more announced in further days. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=330.58s)]
*  But it feels like that's sort of baked in to Putin's calculations at this point, that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=333.64s)]
*  he doesn't think that sanctions are important enough to stop him from doing anything he [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=339.66s)]
*  wants to do. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=343.62s)]
*  And yet it seems like it's the strongest weapon that gets wielded against him. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=344.98s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=350.14s)]
*  We talk a lot about sanctions because that's the instrument we're willing to use. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=351.14s)]
*  There are other instruments that we're not willing to use. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=354.98s)]
*  I think rightly, by the way, I agree with President Biden, but that means we focus on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=356.82s)]
*  that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=360.74s)]
*  And I think we make a miscalculation when we talk about sanctions. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=361.74s)]
*  And I want to be crystal clear. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=365.1s)]
*  I support what the president announced today. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=366.54s)]
*  I would go farther. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=369.38s)]
*  If he wants to do 100 percent sanctions, I want to do 110. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=370.38s)]
*  And I hope there's more to come. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=374.09999999999997s)]
*  At the same time, we need to be realistic and understand that this is a dictatorship [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=376.38s)]
*  in Russia. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=381.78s)]
*  Sanctioning banks, I know the two heads of the banks that were sanctioned today. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=383.46s)]
*  They're not going to go in and tell Vladimir Putin, hey, you better stop your war because [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=387.5s)]
*  my bank was sanctioned. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=390.85999999999996s)]
*  You know why? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=392.5s)]
*  Because they're the leaders of those banks because Putin put them there. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=393.5s)]
*  I think that's an important thing for people to understand. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=396.74s)]
*  He controls that economy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=399.26s)]
*  So we were not going to see the consequences of pressure on Putin for, I predict, months, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=401.18s)]
*  if not years to come from these sanctions. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=407.74s)]
*  So it's the right thing to do. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=409.7s)]
*  There has to be a response. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=411.62s)]
*  But let's have no illusions that this is going to change his calculus, at least in the short [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=413.3s)]
*  run. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=417.18s)]
*  On that last point there, there is a sort of common wisdom about sanctions that you [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=418.82s)]
*  don't sanction directly the rogue state leader. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=422.58s)]
*  You don't sanction the dictator personally. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=426.02000000000004s)]
*  And you saw the president today sort of fending off and not addressing, not answering questions [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=428.26s)]
*  from a lot of different reporters as to why Putin personally wouldn't be targeted with [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=433.46000000000004s)]
*  sanctions. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=437.38s)]
*  The common wisdom for why you don't do that is because once you've sanctioned them, that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=438.38s)]
*  essentially precludes the possibility of negotiating anything with them, of talking to them about [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=441.3s)]
*  anything. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=445.70000000000005s)]
*  And in this case, however, this is going to be resolved. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=446.70000000000005s)]
*  It's going to have to be resolved through some sort of conversation. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  So you need to leave open a door to have a conversation. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=451.02000000000004s)]
*  At some point, does that does Putin become a person who doesn't get talked to? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=454.78s)]
*  At some point, does the door to sanctioning him personally become a more important door, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=458.85999999999996s)]
*  more important, essentially, tactic to use than keeping over the prospect of talking [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=464.82s)]
*  to him, essentially given what's happened with previous conversations and commitments [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=468.82s)]
*  that he's given up in the past? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=472.29999999999995s)]
*  Well, Rachel, you're absolutely right about why our nation, our administration and governments, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans don't like to sanction the head of state because they want to leave [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=480.65999999999997s)]
*  open the possibility to meet. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=484.5s)]
*  I respect that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=487.14000000000004s)]
*  I think it's more symbolic than real. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=488.82s)]
*  But I do think it underscores something else, is we've got to start calling. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  You just used the rogue state, pariah state. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=495.86s)]
*  Those are the right terms to talk about Russia today. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=498.06s)]
*  Tragically, Putin has transformed the state of Russia into those things. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=501.06s)]
*  And we've got to treat him that way in many different shapes and forms, not just in this [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=506.54s)]
*  moment, but across the board. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=510.94s)]
*  Isolate him. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=512.78s)]
*  Don't engage him. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=513.98s)]
*  Don't pretend we're business as usual after this war is over. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=515.3s)]
*  And we've got to stand up to evil. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=518.5s)]
*  Let's just let's call it what it is. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=520.66s)]
*  We've got to stand up. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=522.38s)]
*  There is right and wrong in the world. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=523.9399999999999s)]
*  There is good and evil in the world. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=526.18s)]
*  My government and my country sometimes has been on the wrong side of those. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=528.14s)]
*  Let's be honest about that. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=531.38s)]
*  But in this case, there's right and wrong for those brave Ukrainians that are withstanding [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=532.8199999999999s)]
*  evil. We've got to be with them. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=538.06s)]
*  And by the way, I'm glad you reported it earlier in your program. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=539.9s)]
*  There are also a brave Russians standing up. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=543.02s)]
*  Seventeen hundred were arrested today. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=545.14s)]
*  Fifty three cities were there. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=547.3399999999999s)]
*  Don't underestimate how unpopular this war is. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  They want to hear our voice being as strong. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=553.02s)]
*  They were prepared to be arrested today. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=555.4599999999999s)]
*  We need to show that we are going to be as strong and standing up for good versus evil. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=557.4599999999999s)]
*  Michael McFaul, the former U.S. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=564.3399999999999s)]
*  ambassador to Russia, Professor McFaul, it's always a pleasure to have you. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=565.62s)]
*  But particularly tonight. Thank you. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=569.78s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks for having me. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZDReXB1hlM&t=571.86s)]
