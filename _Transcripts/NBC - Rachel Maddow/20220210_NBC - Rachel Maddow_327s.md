# New Legal Entanglement For Trump As DOJ, Intel Community Assess Mishandling Of Documents
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk)
*  I am now officially out of my depth. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=0.0s)]
*  So joining me is Dan Goldman. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=2.4s)]
*  He is the former Assistant United States Attorney [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=3.96s)]
*  for the Southern District of New York. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=6.0s)]
*  He served as the House Majority Counsel [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  during Donald Trump's first impeachment trial. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=9.96s)]
*  Daniel, I'm okay with the plunger [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=12.52s)]
*  and the toilet side of this equation. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=14.44s)]
*  I don't understand the rest of it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=15.84s)]
*  So please help us out here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=17.6s)]
*  Certainly, Ali. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=19.64s)]
*  From my experience on the House Intelligence Committee [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=20.46s)]
*  where everyone needed to have top secret clearance, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=22.44s)]
*  there are very, very carefully choreographed methods [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=26.7s)]
*  to protect classified information. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=31.22s)]
*  Classified information, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=34.7s)]
*  particularly top secret information, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=35.86s)]
*  does not leave a secured classified area. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=37.44s)]
*  If it does, you put it in a bag with a lock on it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=42.58s)]
*  There are really, really detailed and careful procedures [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=47.7s)]
*  to make sure that no classified material [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=51.22s)]
*  is ever left out to the public [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=54.86s)]
*  for anyone without top secret or secret [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=56.78s)]
*  or whatever classification clearance that is necessary. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=60.14s)]
*  And it doesn't really matter on one level [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=64.2s)]
*  as to who was ultimately responsible [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=69.1s)]
*  for bringing those boxes down to Mar-a-Lago [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=72.18s)]
*  because almost certainly, whatever was in those boxes [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=75.42s)]
*  should not have been classified information. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  Now, the president himself does have the right [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=83.58s)]
*  and the authority to declassify documents, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=86.34s)]
*  but he doesn't just wave a wand in the air and say, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=89.82s)]
*  oh, that's what I'm gonna do. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=93.1s)]
*  This document is declassified. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=95.28s)]
*  That document is declassified. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=97.02s)]
*  All of these documents have very clear markings on them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=99.14s)]
*  They'll say, secret, top secret, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=102.62s)]
*  and a variety of other markings. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  And one of those markings would be declassified [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=109.92s)]
*  or it would cross over the classification markings [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=112.9s)]
*  from earlier if it were to be declassified. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=118.18s)]
*  So there's a process. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  And the fact of there being top secret documents [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=122.78s)]
*  in random boxes in Mar-a-Lago is in and of itself [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  mishandling of classified information. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=132.28s)]
*  What we don't know is who did that, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=134.42000000000002s)]
*  who was responsible for it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=136.74s)]
*  Presumably Donald Trump was not packing his own boxes, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  but was he aware of what was in them [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=141.78s)]
*  and who else was aware who oversaw this? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=144.34s)]
*  And that's where the Department of Justice and the FBI [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=146.94s)]
*  need to get involved [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=149.7s)]
*  because even if there's no criminal investigation [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=150.98s)]
*  or criminal prosecution that arises from this, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=154.14s)]
*  it is a national security issue. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=157.16s)]
*  And the FBI's counterintelligence division [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=159.62s)]
*  needs to figure out what happened. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=162.62s)]
*  Does this fall under the purview [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=164.86s)]
*  of the January 6th investigation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=166.7s)]
*  or is this an FBI Justice Department matter? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=168.36s)]
*  No, and in the report it also says [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=171.06s)]
*  that even when they uncovered the top secret information [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=173.38s)]
*  and relayed that to the FBI, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=177.6s)]
*  the FBI was still figuring out what they should do with it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  But I do think it's important to put this in perspective. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  The classification issues related to the stuff [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=185.9s)]
*  that was in the documents, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=190.94s)]
*  the Presidential Records Act violation [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=192.5s)]
*  is not something that really falls [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=196.08s)]
*  within the purview of the January 6th committee. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=198.62s)]
*  The House Oversight Committee under Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=202.18s)]
*  has announced an investigation into that issue. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  That is separate from the January 6th investigation. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=208.56s)]
*  What I think is important and that overlaps a lot [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=211.9s)]
*  with this Presidential Records Act [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=216.36s)]
*  and the January 6th committee investigation is two things. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=217.94s)]
*  One, one is the fact that there are very few call logs [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=222.86s)]
*  from the day of January 6th is an issue. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=226.5s)]
*  What happened was Donald Trump intentionally [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=229.26s)]
*  concealing conversations that he was having with people [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=232.74s)]
*  through his aides' personal cell phones [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=236.82s)]
*  that are not protected and are not supposed to be used [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=240.26s)]
*  or where was he when he was having these conversations? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=245.06s)]
*  Because we know that he also was sneaking people [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=249.22s)]
*  in the side door for meetings prior to January 6th. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=251.82s)]
*  And then the other thing that I think is very important here [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=255.66s)]
*  and is a continuation of a pattern [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=258.3s)]
*  that we've seen from Donald Trump [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=260.3s)]
*  is the destruction of these documents, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=262.22s)]
*  whether he ripped them up, tore them up, ate them, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=264.9s)]
*  flushed them down the toilet or whatever it is, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=267.46s)]
*  he is destroying Presidential Records. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=269.9s)]
*  Now, that's a violation of the Presidential Records Act, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  but this is also someone [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=275.46s)]
*  who obstructed the Mueller investigation, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=276.98s)]
*  who obstructed the first impeachment investigation [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=279.58s)]
*  that I worked on and has a history [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=282.98s)]
*  of obstructing investigations, of trying to hide [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=285.78s)]
*  what we can only assume now is misconduct [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=290.21999999999997s)]
*  because of the pattern and practice of doing that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=293.38s)]
*  And so the question then becomes, what is he ripping up? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=296.22s)]
*  What is he tearing? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=299.86s)]
*  What is he trying to hide? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=300.82s)]
*  And presumably that falls [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=302.58s)]
*  under the January 6th investigation. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRdanjpaTRk&t=304.54s)]
