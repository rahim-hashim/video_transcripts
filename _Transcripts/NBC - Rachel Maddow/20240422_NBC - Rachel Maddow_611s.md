# 'Miserable' and 'Annoyed': What Rachel Maddow saw inside Trump's criminal trial
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I)
*  Let us bring in someone who actually saw Donald Trump in the courtroom, Rachel Maddow, MSNBC's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=0.0s)]
*  Rachel Maddow, who is one of the very few people inside the courtroom today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=6.0s)]
*  Rachel, we were just reading, going to Google Doc, fill in the gaps. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=9.82s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=14.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, thanks for having me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=16.68s)]
*  And thanks to everybody at NBC who made it possible for me to get in the courtroom today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=20.04s)]
*  I realize this is a hot ticket, and it's a privilege to be able to cover something this [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=23.44s)]
*  historic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=28.36s)]
*  I mean, I will say just in terms of the vibe in the room, what you have heard about it [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=30.36s)]
*  being kind of a dingy courtroom is real, and that is not necessarily important in terms [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=33.88s)]
*  of the way the wheels of justice grind, but it is striking to see the former president, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=40.32s)]
*  somebody who's tried to sort of embody the kind of luxury brand, sitting in a room that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=45.28s)]
*  essentially feels like a high-ceiling DMV office. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=48.92s)]
*  It's a very tense atmosphere, a very sober atmosphere, but two very different styles [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=54.08s)]
*  of presentation from the prosecution and from the defense. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=60.2s)]
*  The prosecution was reserved. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  The prosecutor, Matthew Colangelo, who made the opening statement, read from prepared [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=67.44s)]
*  remarks and it was a very cogent, very orderly, very reserved presentation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  President Trump's defense was much more emotional. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=77.28s)]
*  He appeared to be speaking sort of from talking points, and there was a lot of ad libbing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=79.12s)]
*  There was then also not chaos, but a lot of kinetic activity when prosecutors started [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  objecting to the opening statement. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=89.52s)]
*  The judge called multiple times for the counsel to come and approach the bench and discuss [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=91.12s)]
*  those objections. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=95.12s)]
*  Just two very different ways of presenting the case to the jury, both stylistically and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=97.8s)]
*  in terms of the content. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=104.08s)]
*  We got a real roadmap today as to how this case is going to go. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=105.08s)]
*  You know, Rachel, one of the things that I keep hearing about and reading about is how [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=108.96s)]
*  complex this actually is, that when you want to make the dots go together, for some people [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=113.96s)]
*  it's not going to rise to the level in their mind of a crime. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=121.34s)]
*  And it's up, obviously, to the prosecutor to make that case that this isn't just about [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  hush money. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=131.6s)]
*  Here's why this is a felony offense under the law. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=132.76s)]
*  Did they do that? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  Was it a clear cogent story in your hearing, understanding that Rachel Maddow has more [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=140.24s)]
*  of an understanding of this case than the average juror might? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=147.2s)]
*  But as the storytelling, one of the things that many prosecutors have told me over the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=151.32s)]
*  years is my job is to go and tell a story that's going to set the stage for the jury [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=156.44s)]
*  to believe and understand why I brought these charges. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=162.4s)]
*  That simple. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=165.52s)]
*  Yes, and that is absolutely what you saw today from the prosecution. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=167.52s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what the jury will ultimately decide. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=171.52s)]
*  We don't know how the evidence will be presented. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=174.36s)]
*  We don't know which side will be compelling, ultimately, in the minds of these 12 New Yorkers. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=176.76s)]
*  But when the prosecution got up today, what they said was, without equivocation, without [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=181.12s)]
*  without parenthetical phrases, they said this was this kind of a crime. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  This is how we know that he did it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=192.16s)]
*  This is what we're going to show you about how he did it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=193.96s)]
*  And there's going to be absolutely no doubt in your mind. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=195.84s)]
*  It is going to be beyond a reasonable doubt in all of your minds that he did this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=198.56s)]
*  They presented it as both a serious case and an open and shut case. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=202.86s)]
*  Now, I say that because you think that's sort of platonic ideal of any legal argument, but [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=206.96s)]
*  it was very different from the defense side. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=211.96s)]
*  The defense argument was much more baroque. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=214.24s)]
*  It had many more asides. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=216.64s)]
*  There was a digression from Todd Blanch about how you're going to hear us describe him as [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=218.44s)]
*  President Trump today. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  We're always going to call him president. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  That is a title that he has earned. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=227.28s)]
*  He was running the country, kept going up, going going back to to things like that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=228.84s)]
*  After the judge instructed the jurors that the defense does not have to prove the innocence [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=235.04s)]
*  of Donald Trump, they just need to make sure that the prosecution doesn't prove without [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=244.0s)]
*  a reasonable doubt that he did it, Blanch, in fact, advanced a whole counterfactual. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  Those invoices from Michael Cohen were really about a legal retainer for his legal services. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=252.96s)]
*  And there was no sexual encounter between Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=259.32s)]
*  And all of these other sort of counter narratives that might explain the evidence that, again, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=264.44s)]
*  were not just connecting the dots, that were kind of a baroque, detailed, elaborate story [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=271.68s)]
*  with a lot of emotion attached to it that the jury was expected, I think, to buy into [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=276.64s)]
*  as much with their heart as with their minds. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=280.28000000000003s)]
*  So a much more cerebral, simple case from the prosecution. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=282.16s)]
*  And Rachel, can you, I don't know from where you were sitting, but can you describe Donald [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=286.68s)]
*  Trump's affect, particularly when David Pecker came in and when he was testifying or when [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  he was being described by the prosecution? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=297.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=301.0s)]
*  And I should say, in the courtroom, it's, you know, President Trump's back is to all [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=302.0s)]
*  of us who are sitting as observers in the courtroom. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  There are monitors that are mounted in the courtroom. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=312.04s)]
*  We can see a forward-facing view from him, but it's a little occluded. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=314.32000000000005s)]
*  So it may be the people in the overflow room who are looking right at those monitors might [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=318.76s)]
*  have had a better look. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  From where I was sitting, he seemed basically inert. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=323.6s)]
*  He kind of slumped his shoulders and was kind of, I'm a slump-shouldered person, he was [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=331.96s)]
*  kind of slump-shouldered like this when he came in and while he was sitting there. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=335.4s)]
*  At times when Mr. Pecker was testifying, I noted that he was kind of leaning heavily [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=338.6s)]
*  on the desk. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=343.4s)]
*  There were times when he leaned from one side to the other. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=344.4s)]
*  But I just didn't see him as particularly animated. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=346.52s)]
*  Again, I may not have been in the best position to observe that closely. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=349.32s)]
*  I've seen him in person in my life a few times. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=354.64s)]
*  I would say seeing him go up and down the aisle, I was sitting on the aisle, seeing [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=357.55999999999995s)]
*  him walk right past me in the aisle, in and out of the courtroom several times, including [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=361.96s)]
*  the recess, I would say that he seems thinner than I have seen him in the past. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=365.0s)]
*  He seems considerably older and he seems annoyed, resigned, maybe angry. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=371.0s)]
*  He seems like a man who's miserable to be here. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=382.0s)]
*  And again, I'm no body language expert and this is just my observation, but he seems [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=384.28s)]
*  old and tired and mad. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=390.0s)]
*  And I probably would seem that way too if I was looking at this kind of a proceeding. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=391.88s)]
*  When he came out, he was notably annoyed and this shouldn't be happening. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=396.8s)]
*  And then he repeated a lot of things that are not fact-based, so we cut out of it and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  corrected it, but saying that this was just a simple bookkeeping matter and he seemed [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=406.04s)]
*  really angry, annoyed and angry. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=411.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=415.64s)]
*  And you'll obviously see it and hear it when you come back and you're preparing for your [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=417.52s)]
*  special tonight, which we'll talk about. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=422.68s)]
*  I'm very curious about David Pecker as well because he was also described by some of the [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=424.92s)]
*  folks who were in the room as seeming old. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=428.8s)]
*  And there's the facts that a witness gives, right? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  And there's also the way they present it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  Do they seem reluctant? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=436.56s)]
*  Are they credible? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=438.64000000000004s)]
*  What were your observations? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=439.96000000000004s)]
*  Again, I know you're not a body language expert and I'm just asking you for your observations [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  about David Pecker. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=445.72s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=449.36s)]
*  We didn't get a ton of testimony from Mr. Pecker, right? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=450.36s)]
*  The proceedings ended today at 1230 Eastern Time. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=453.36s)]
*  There was a 10-minute recess around 1145 or noon. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=456.4s)]
*  There was another sort of long break when there was an interruption because the judge [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=460.52s)]
*  had told the jurors they could have writing implements and they could have pads of paper [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=464.48s)]
*  if they wanted, but he forgot to ask them if they wanted those. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=468.8s)]
*  And then so it was another interruption where everybody got their school supplies. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=472.0s)]
*  So that ate up a lot of time and so we didn't get a lot from Mr. Pecker. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  I will say my impressions of him, I mean, he described himself, you'll see this in the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=479.64000000000004s)]
*  transcript later today when we get it, as 72 years old. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=483.76000000000005s)]
*  He now is self-employed as a consultant, including consulting for the company that he used to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=488.68s)]
*  run but he doesn't run that company anymore. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=492.8s)]
*  He did say that he was at this proceeding under subpoena and that he had a lawyer present [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=495.52000000000004s)]
*  in the courtroom. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=499.64000000000004s)]
*  He's a physically small man. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=502.64000000000004s)]
*  He's sort of slight. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=504.6s)]
*  He looks just like he does in his pictures. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  But he's small. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=509.28s)]
*  He's soft spoken. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=510.28s)]
*  And I would describe his speaking style, the way he answered questions from the prosecutor [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=511.67999999999995s)]
*  as somewhat elliptical, meaning he would be asked a direct question and he'd give you [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=517.28s)]
*  kind of the full four corners of the room in which the answer to that question lived. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=523.0s)]
*  That meant, for example, that the prosecutor had to ask him three or four times, were you [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=528.12s)]
*  ultimately in charge of what stories were published in your publications or for what [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=533.24s)]
*  stories were not published? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=537.24s)]
*  The prosecutor had to ask him three or four times before he finally said, yeah, the buck [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=538.64s)]
*  stuck with me. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=541.64s)]
*  I'm the one who... [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=542.64s)]
*  He didn't use the phrase the buck stuck with me. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=543.64s)]
*  But he said, these are the stories, the stories that were not published. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=544.64s)]
*  That was ultimately up to me. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=549.72s)]
*  Took him a while to get there. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=551.12s)]
*  It just makes me think that we'll see how it goes in forthcoming days, but it may take [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=552.12s)]
*  a while to get through a direct examination with Mr. Pecker as long as he keeps speaking [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=556.2s)]
*  the way he did today, which was slow and elliptical. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=561.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, for whatever training, professional training, you may not have, your keen observations [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=564.0s)]
*  and analytical skills are beyond intact, Rachel Maddow. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=569.68s)]
*  And we're a little bit jealous that you were there. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=574.16s)]
*  And thank you so much for coming out and talking to us. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81vER9p9R4I&t=577.0799999999999s)]
