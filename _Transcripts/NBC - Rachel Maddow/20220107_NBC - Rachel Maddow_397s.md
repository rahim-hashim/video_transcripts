# Trump Victim Act Follows Authoritarian Playbook Drawing In Fanatical Supporters
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U)
*  When one party's violent anti-democratic rioters are another party's heroes, history tells [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=0.0s)]
*  us things can get ugly fast. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=6.26s)]
*  And again, we kind of know how to see this, how to interpret it, when it happens in other [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=8.82s)]
*  places. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=13.76s)]
*  When we can see the forces of democracy and autocracy battling it out in the streets of, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=15.1s)]
*  say, Kazakhstan. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=19.98s)]
*  But it is much harder to understand that battle and how to fight it when it's close up. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=21.62s)]
*  When the democratic struggles that we've watched in other countries become our own. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=27.52s)]
*  Joining us now is Ruth Ben-Ghiat. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=33.92s)]
*  She is a professor of history at NYU, the author of Strongmen, Mussolini to the Present. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=35.58s)]
*  She also writes a newsletter on threats to democracy called Lucid, where she says this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=40.2s)]
*  week, quote, we are living through a right-wing counterrevolution. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=44.84s)]
*  And January 6th was a milestone on America's path away from democracy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=48.82s)]
*  Professor Ben-Ghiat, it's good to see you again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=54.28s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=56.04s)]
*  Thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=57.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=58.04s)]
*  I want to ask you about this issue that you write about in your book and other historians [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=59.04s)]
*  talk about, and that is that there is something about American exceptionalism, about the strength [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  of belief that Americans have in themselves, which is a little bit different from patriots [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=71.96s)]
*  in other countries, that doesn't allow us to see fundamental flaws or faults like the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=76.08s)]
*  one that you described. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=82.02s)]
*  There's something that doesn't want us to believe that what we saw a year ago was actually [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=83.24s)]
*  an attack on democracy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Americans have always been very invested in the idea of America as a beacon of freedom, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=90.36s)]
*  and it has been for so many immigrants who have come here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=97.32s)]
*  But there's a whole other side to American engagement with democracy, such as all the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=100.88s)]
*  And during the Cold War, the Juntas that the United States propped up and helped to happen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=106.92s)]
*  It's taken away democracy from countries. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=113.88s)]
*  And what's so poignant about that is right now we're living through a very serious assault [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=116.84s)]
*  on democracy, and some of the people involved in that, Trump and Roger Stone and Bannon [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=123.12s)]
*  and Paul Manafort, these are people with decades of experience in wrecking democracies and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=129.28s)]
*  propping up dictatorships and funding dictators in the case of Trump's money laundering. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=134.88s)]
*  And so Trump, it's been a huge wake up call. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=141.44s)]
*  And because I study fascism, I saw very early who Trump was. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=145.56s)]
*  And I wrote Strongmen because I wanted to let my fellow Americans know that it can happen [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  here, that over history, many other cultures and peoples have been very amazed that it [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=156.88s)]
*  happened to them and that Trump was not going to leave quietly because he was using an [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=163.52s)]
*  autocratic rather than a democratic playbook to govern. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=171.12s)]
*  Let me ask you about the language we use here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=175.84s)]
*  You talk about it being a wake up call, but not everybody's woken up yet. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=177.56s)]
*  I want to quote from your book in which you say, for a political system that affects the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  lives of so many, authoritarianism remains a surprisingly fuzzy concept. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=184.08s)]
*  We still lack a common language to speak about the governments of the 21st century [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=189.28s)]
*  authoritarian rulers who repress civil liberties, but use elections to keep themselves in power. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  There are many Americans today who will say there's nothing wrong with our democracy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  We have elections. We will continue to have elections. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=205.64s)]
*  Yeah, the problem with that is and we can look to Victor Orban, who Tucker Carlson and the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  GOP, even Mike Pence, they're all trotting over to Budapest. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=214.92s)]
*  Today, you don't normally ban elections. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=218.96s)]
*  That's less common. You hold elections and you fix them like the ruler of Kazakhstan and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=221.92s)]
*  Belarus and Putin. So you can say you are like Orban calls to stage an illiberal [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=228.0s)]
*  democracy. Well, there's not much democratic about it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=234.64s)]
*  But this is what's, of course, happening now at the level of the states. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=237.96s)]
*  The GOP is assaulting our election mechanism. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=241.4s)]
*  But this idea that you can still say you're a democracy, you leave a pocket of opposition. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=245.72000000000003s)]
*  So we are in this period of time where many states are in a transition between [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=251.12s)]
*  democracy and autocracy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=256.72s)]
*  And some people use the word electoral autocracy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=258.8s)]
*  Some people use the word anocracy to use. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=261.44s)]
*  Some people call the United States that after January 6. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  So we do we're still searching for a language because authoritarianism is itself in [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=268.0s)]
*  transition. I want to read something else that I think is interesting from your book, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=274.08s)]
*  because one of the discussions that we have is how we have this conversation with people who do [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=278.84s)]
*  not believe what you are saying to be the truth. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=282.64s)]
*  You write that the decay of truth and democratic dissolution proceed hand in hand, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=285.12s)]
*  starting with the insurgents assertion that the establishment media delivers false or [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=289.68s)]
*  biased information while he speaks the truth and risks everything to get the real facts [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=294.72s)]
*  out. Once his supporters bond to this person, they stop caring about his falsehoods. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  This may be where we are with a good portion of Americans right now. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=307.08s)]
*  Yeah, and Trump did this right away. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=311.68s)]
*  And, you know, I have a picture in my book about with Hitler with his mouth tape shut [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  because there was a speaking ban on Hitler and Weimar Germany because of his hate speech. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=319.92s)]
*  And the Nazi Party made political capital out of that, calling him a victim. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  So victimhood is very important to the strongman profile. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=329.16s)]
*  And the whole thing with Trump right now is that he is a very able propagandist, a very [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  able storyteller who is always the victim. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  And so this very compelling story of him as the leader, the hero, the savior of the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=342.36s)]
*  nation who's been wronged, that something that's rightfully his, the election has been [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  stolen from him. And he's he's trying to tell the truth. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=352.36s)]
*  He's always had that persona and it's been really effective at building a fanatical [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  base who are willing to go and wreck Congress for him. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=361.92s)]
*  And I really see January 6th was a coup event. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=366.04s)]
*  It was a milestone on a race war, but it's also an authoritarian leader cult rescue [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  operation. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OYUTLvoR-U&t=374.92s)]
