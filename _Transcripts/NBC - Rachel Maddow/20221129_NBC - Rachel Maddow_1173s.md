# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Nov. 28
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts)
*  In the great state of Arizona, today is the deadline for every county in the state to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=0.0s)]
*  certify the election results from the midterm elections. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=3.86s)]
*  Three of the state's counties waited until today's deadline to actually take their vote [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=8.08s)]
*  on certification. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=11.96s)]
*  Mojave County flirted with maybe refusing to certify their election results today, but [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=13.56s)]
*  ultimately after two long meetings, they did vote unanimously that they would certify. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=19.46s)]
*  Cochise County had previously tried to insist that they would only count their votes by [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=25.52s)]
*  hand, something they proved immediately and definitively unable to do. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=30.2s)]
*  You might remember that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=34.92s)]
*  Ultimately they ended up abandoning their hand count when a court ordered them to do so. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=36.44s)]
*  Well today, Cochise County declined to certify their election results. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=41.6s)]
*  They decided they apparently don't care about the deadline to certify. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  They say they're going to talk about certifying again at another meeting they're going to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=50.16s)]
*  hold on Friday of this week. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=53.44s)]
*  But again, today's the deadline by which they needed to act. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=56.12s)]
*  They did not act. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=59.36s)]
*  Because of that, Cochise County is now facing two lawsuits to try to compel them to certify [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=61.72s)]
*  the vote. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=66.74s)]
*  The question then of course immediately arises. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=68.56s)]
*  If the courts do end up ordering Cochise County to certify the election results, will Cochise [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  County obey the court's order or will they defy it? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=75.88s)]
*  And if they defy it, then what happens? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  There's another deadline rapidly approaching, December 8th. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=82.04s)]
*  That's the deadline for the whole state of Arizona to certify the election results statewide. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  Now theoretically, if Cochise County makes it to then, makes it to December 8th, while [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=91.08000000000001s)]
*  still refusing to certify the votes for their county, theoretically that would mean that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  Arizona would certify the vote count for every county except Cochise County. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  Cochise County voters wouldn't have their votes added to the state vote totals. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=107.44s)]
*  If that happens, which would be crazy, that might actually end up resulting in some races [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=114.08s)]
*  having their results flipped. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=119.7s)]
*  Cochise County votes very heavily for Republicans. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=121.36s)]
*  If none of that county's votes are going to count because the county won't certify them, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=123.78s)]
*  then some Arizona races that went to Republican candidates might end up flipping to the Democrat [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=128.4s)]
*  instead. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=133.48s)]
*  Unless you subtract all the heavily Republican votes from Cochise County. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=134.48s)]
*  That of course would be completely nuts, particularly because the reason Cochise County supervisors [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=138.39999999999998s)]
*  aren't certifying the election results there is not because they think anything fishy happened [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  in their own county. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  It's because of things they've heard that sound bad to them about the elections in other [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=149.6s)]
*  places, specifically in Maricopa County, Arizona, which is Arizona's biggest population center. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=155.04s)]
*  Today the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to certify their county's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=161.56s)]
*  election results, but they only took that vote after a tense four-hour long public meeting [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=165.36s)]
*  filled with a very excitable group in a very packed auditorium. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=171.10000000000002s)]
*  Shame to hell to Maricopa County for dragging our fine Arizona straight to the toilet. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=178.8s)]
*  This is vote trafficking at its finest. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=189.36s)]
*  I've seen the criminal element. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=191.64000000000001s)]
*  You are vote traffickers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=193.8s)]
*  You are vote traffickers. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  Criminal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  You're not losing friends because of the way that you handled this election process. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  You're losing friends because you're evil and corrupt and you know it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  I came here today to get an up close and personal look at the seven traitors to the United States [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=207.36s)]
*  Constitution. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=214.4s)]
*  Again, please. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=215.4s)]
*  Sitting at that desk. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=216.44s)]
*  The voting booth is supposed to be a time for a peaceful revolution. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=218.72s)]
*  Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution necessary. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=224.16s)]
*  That was Maricopa County, Arizona today as they nevertheless voted to certify that county's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=233.6s)]
*  election results. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  We've got the leading presidential contender for the Republican nomination in 2024. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=241.32s)]
*  This holiday weekend having a nice Thanksgiving dinner with Kanye West, the rapper who just [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  lost all of his corporate sponsorship deals when he started saying he was going to go [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=252.2s)]
*  DEATH CON 3 on the Jews. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=256.2s)]
*  The leading Republican presidential candidate, their last president, Donald Trump, just hosted [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=260.76s)]
*  Mr. West this weekend. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=264.4s)]
*  And also this man for what was apparently a very nice Thanksgiving dinner at the former [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=266.98s)]
*  president's home. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=271.82s)]
*  When you look at these things like abortion, it's popular. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=272.82s)]
*  People like abortion, hate it, but it's true. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=278.20000000000005s)]
*  And you can thank the Jewish media for that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=281.5s)]
*  Abortion is popular. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=284.18s)]
*  Sodomy is popular. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=285.18s)]
*  You know, being gay is popular. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=286.18s)]
*  Being a feminist is popular. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=288.62s)]
*  Sex out of wedlock is popular. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=290.98s)]
*  Contraceptives are popular. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  It's all popular. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  That's all. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=294.46000000000004s)]
*  That's not to say it's good. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=295.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't have to say I like that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=296.94s)]
*  Popular means the people support it, which they do. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=297.94s)]
*  And it sucks and it is what it is, but that's why we need a dictatorship. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=301.38s)]
*  That's unironically why we need to get rid of all that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=306.46s)]
*  We need to take control of the media or take control of the government and force the people [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=309.0s)]
*  to believe what we believe. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  That's why we need a dictatorship. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=315.17999999999995s)]
*  Force people to believe what we believe. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=318.82s)]
*  We need a dictatorship, unironically. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=320.17999999999995s)]
*  So that clip is from People for the American Way. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=322.85999999999996s)]
*  They have a project called Right Wing Watch, where they monitor and document what's going [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=325.18s)]
*  on on the ultra right, on the far right fringe. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=329.26s)]
*  And that's a great public service all of the time. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=333.22s)]
*  I'll tell you, it becomes a fire alarm system for the whole country when someone from that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=335.1s)]
*  fringe, someone from that far out on the political spectrum, ends up having a Thanksgiving dinner [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=339.58s)]
*  with the Republican Party's leading candidate for president. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=345.54s)]
*  Here's the pathway. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  We have one more election where white people can make the decision. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=351.62s)]
*  The white people got to make the right decision and then Trump's got to get in there and never [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=354.86s)]
*  leave. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=358.26s)]
*  That, to me at this point, is a pathway. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=359.26s)]
*  It's time to shut up, elect Trump one more time, and then stop having elections. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=360.86s)]
*  We have got to talk about the fundamentals of our worldview and what it would look like [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=367.66s)]
*  to build a society based on our distinct worldview. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=373.94s)]
*  It looks like a society where women don't have the right to vote. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=377.58000000000004s)]
*  It looks like a society where boys and girls get married as teenagers and start having [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=380.66s)]
*  kids and they don't use birth control and they don't use contraceptives and they have [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=386.5s)]
*  big families and a high birth rate. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=391.66s)]
*  And it looks like women wearing veils at church and it looks like women not being in the workforce. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=394.22s)]
*  Banning gay marriage is back on the menu. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=401.3s)]
*  Banning sodomy is back on the menu. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=404.22s)]
*  Banning contraceptives is back on the menu. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=407.14000000000004s)]
*  And basically we're having something like Taliban rule in America in a good way. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  We're having something like a Catholic Taliban rule in America. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=418.1s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=422.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, not with the Jim Crow stuff. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=425.3s)]
*  Oh, they had to drink out of a different water fountain. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=426.3s)]
*  Big f***ing deal. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  Oh no, they had to go to a different school. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=431.14000000000004s)]
*  Their water fountain in that famous picture was worse. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=433.98s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=437.38s)]
*  Grow up, drink out of the f***ing water fountain. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=438.38s)]
*  It's water. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  It's the same. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  You know? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=441.90000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, even if it was bad. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=442.90000000000003s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=444.94s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=445.94s)]
*  It's better. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=446.94s)]
*  It's better in general. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=447.94s)]
*  We all agree. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=448.94s)]
*  It's better. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=449.94s)]
*  It's better. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=450.94s)]
*  Jim Crow segregation, it was better. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=451.94s)]
*  Almost all of that was posted by People for the American Way, their project Right Wing [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=454.26s)]
*  Watch which monitors stuff like this on the far right, which is usually only of interest [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=457.98s)]
*  to people who study the far right, but it suddenly becomes totally relevant to everyone [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=462.82s)]
*  else in the country when a guy like that suddenly ends up invited to the home of the Republican [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=467.3s)]
*  Party's leading presidential candidate to have a private Thanksgiving dinner with him. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=474.06s)]
*  That guy and former President Donald Trump, I should tell you he is also a Holocaust denier. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=481.3s)]
*  I'm not going to show you those clips of him denying the Holocaust, but they're there. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=486.5s)]
*  He not only explicitly calls for the imposition of a dictatorship in this country, he's explicitly [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=491.26s)]
*  praised Hitler. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=495.82s)]
*  He says Jewish people should not be allowed to participate in the U.S. government. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=497.14s)]
*  And now he's having a nice private dinner with the man most likely to be the next Republican [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=501.38s)]
*  nominee for president of the United States. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=505.02s)]
*  So yeah, back to work on this split screen. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=510.02s)]
*  In politics, we've got sort of normal or normal-ish questions right now about what are the Democrats [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=515.26s)]
*  going to get done in the lame duck period and are they working enough of the days in [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=523.3000000000001s)]
*  the lame duck period? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=526.86s)]
*  Are they acting with enough urgency given that they're about to lose control of half [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=528.1s)]
*  of Congress? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=531.38s)]
*  Will there be a government funding bill in time to avert another dumb government shutdown? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=532.5400000000001s)]
*  Will the House Republican leader get enough votes to become speaker on the first ballot? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=536.76s)]
*  We've got all these sort of normal politics headlines here on Earth One, but it's all [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=540.94s)]
*  simultaneous and adjacent to the death con three on the Jews guy and the Holocaust denier [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=548.22s)]
*  eating turkey and stuffing with the leader of the Republican Party at his home. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=557.86s)]
*  And I feel like since this came to light over the holiday weekend, most of the talk in political [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=564.5400000000001s)]
*  circles has been about whether or not this is bad for Trump, whether or not this is going [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=569.66s)]
*  to reflect poorly on him as the leader of the Republican Party, whether this is something [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=573.74s)]
*  that might hurt him in some way, whether this might be a mistake for him or whether this [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=578.4599999999999s)]
*  will slide off him too. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=582.02s)]
*  OK. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=584.54s)]
*  The reason groups like People for the American Way monitor guys like this and keep track [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  of what they are saying and doing is not just because a guy like this might have an incidental [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=593.5s)]
*  effect someday on some real politician who interacts with them. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=598.86s)]
*  The reason that it is worth keeping track of Holocaust denying racist agitators who [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=603.66s)]
*  advocate race war and, I kid you not, burning women alive in America, the reason you monitor [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=609.5s)]
*  guys like that is not just because of their potential future impact someday on other people [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=618.58s)]
*  who have power. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=623.14s)]
*  It's because of their power and because of the damage that they want to do. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=624.38s)]
*  And guys like that, neo-Nazi agitators getting a big proverbial hug, getting a private audience [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=629.98s)]
*  with the Republican Party's likely next presidential nominee, yes, sure, that reflects on that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=635.34s)]
*  political candidate and on his party. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=640.42s)]
*  But more importantly, it's great for the Nazis, right? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=642.38s)]
*  It's a supercharging thing for them, for their perceived legitimacy, their reach, their ability [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=646.34s)]
*  to get their message out to people, to operate, to recruit and to do what they want to do, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=652.5799999999999s)]
*  which in this guy's case is turning the United States of America into a whites-only, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=656.8199999999999s)]
*  no-Jews-allowed fascist homeland under a dictator who he would please like to be Donald Trump. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=661.3s)]
*  It is hard to have regular, everyday, normal politics alongside this kind of politics too, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=670.14s)]
*  but that's where we are. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=676.78s)]
*  And the violent ultra-right will benefit greatly from this moment, whether or not any right-wing [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=678.3s)]
*  politicians do as well. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=683.38s)]
*  This weekend saw protests in cities all across China, sparked by opposition to the government's [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=686.54s)]
*  strict COVID lockdowns. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=691.0999999999999s)]
*  It's almost impossible to overstate how unusual it is to see any kind of public protest, public [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=693.26s)]
*  opposition in China nowadays, let alone large crowds protesting in multiple cities. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=698.26s)]
*  I mean, this is an authoritarian country. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=703.18s)]
*  The Chinese government has cracked down incredibly hard. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=705.42s)]
*  They've made it nearly impossible for activists to organize at any scale at all. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=708.4599999999999s)]
*  But look, I mean, here the people are chanting and demanding freedom. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=712.6999999999999s)]
*  And yes, the spark of it was about COVID lockdowns, but it's everything. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=718.6999999999999s)]
*  In Shanghai, protesters there called for the Chinese Communist Party to leave power, called [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=723.54s)]
*  for China's president to step down. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=729.66s)]
*  That's a sentiment that is almost literally unspeakable in China. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=732.1s)]
*  In the capital, Beijing, protesters chanted freedom of the press to each other across [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=737.34s)]
*  a river, a call and response, freedom of the press, freedom of the press. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=742.3000000000001s)]
*  An unofficial symbol of the demonstrations has become a blank sheet of white paper held [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=747.1800000000001s)]
*  in the air by protesters as a symbol of all the things they are not allowed to say. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=752.62s)]
*  You might remember seeing Russians arrested in Russia after Russia invaded Ukraine, Russians [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=758.22s)]
*  arrested on the street for nothing other than holding a piece of paper or a piece of posterboard [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=763.7s)]
*  with nothing written on it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=768.46s)]
*  Well, now people in China are doing the same thing, showing that they are not allowed to speak. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=770.14s)]
*  Things are very tense and scary in China right now amidst all this bravery from the Chinese people. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=776.98s)]
*  Nobody really knows how exactly the government is going to respond. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=783.02s)]
*  There are fears, of course, that a violent crackdown may be coming. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=785.54s)]
*  But those blank pages, of course, are a reminder. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=790.0999999999999s)]
*  You can shut down every last pro-democracy newspaper, but you can't shut down the human [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=792.26s)]
*  desire for free speech and for free press. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=796.86s)]
*  It's also a good reminder that people, wherever they can, will fight like hell to get those things. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=799.54s)]
*  And hopefully they'll fight like hell to defend them and keep them once they've got them. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=806.18s)]
*  Joining us now is Kathleen Ballou. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  She teaches history at Northwestern. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=813.2199999999999s)]
*  She's the author of Bring the War Home, the White Power Movement and Paramilitary America, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=814.74s)]
*  which is a seminal text in this field. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=819.54s)]
*  Professor Ballou, I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=821.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=824.1800000000001s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=825.86s)]
*  I want to ask you about my job and my role in this and the role of our conversation about this, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=829.38s)]
*  because I feel like one of the things that I've learned from your scholarship and from the field [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=835.7s)]
*  in which you've contributed so much is to understand that when you get ultra-right, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=839.7s)]
*  violent, and white power movements adjacent to people with real political power, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=844.4200000000001s)]
*  yes, it may be worth looking at how they influence people with real political power, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=850.1800000000001s)]
*  but one of the more, perhaps more immediate impact is that it tends to supercharge and promote [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=854.5s)]
*  and help do their work, these people who are on the far, far ultra-right. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=861.86s)]
*  And I don't want to be part of that. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=867.62s)]
*  I don't want to amplify this guy's message, but I feel like Trump just put him in a new [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=869.46s)]
*  level of the sort of stratosphere in terms of its political influence. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=873.46s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=877.3000000000001s)]
*  And we can talk about that without saying his name or directing people to his websites or [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=877.94s)]
*  anything like that. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=882.26s)]
*  I think the issue here, if we step back a moment from sort of the news cycle part of this [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=883.62s)]
*  and think about how it sits in a broader historical context, is that this is an activist that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=889.46s)]
*  Trump is claiming not to know, even though this person was involved in the Unite the Right rally [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=896.1800000000001s)]
*  in Charlottesville in 2017, is involved in January 6th. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=900.4200000000001s)]
*  This is a long-time player. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=903.7800000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, the claims not to know who he is are, I mean, specious at best. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=906.5s)]
*  But the bigger point here is what this kind of a meeting unlocks for the future, because I think [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=912.1800000000001s)]
*  the only place I would take issue with your opening monologue, which was excellent as always, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=919.86s)]
*  is the idea that this movement would like Trump to be the dictator. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=924.26s)]
*  I mean, they'll take him because he's there. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=927.38s)]
*  But Trump is not the point. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=929.38s)]
*  The point is the seizure of power. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=931.38s)]
*  The point is the white ethnostate. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=933.38s)]
*  The point is all of that violence against populations that are targeted by this movement [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=935.38s)]
*  that is unleashed right now in a sort of ad hoc fashion, but that would be unleashed in a much [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=940.18s)]
*  more systematic way if and when these people begin to amass political power. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=945.3s)]
*  So what we have to think about is not only Trump, but also all of the other people in the GOP who [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=950.0999999999999s)]
*  have been shoulder to shoulder with this particular activist, including Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=954.74s)]
*  Gosar, including several others, and the people who are also presumptive nominees in 2024 who have [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=960.74s)]
*  not taken the opportunity to decry this meeting. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=970.5799999999999s)]
*  I saw that Mike Pence did eventually today and okay, perhaps there's a delay because of the holiday [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=974.02s)]
*  weekend, but the fact that the GOP is not coming out full-throatedly against this is a notable [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=978.34s)]
*  escalation in how much they are allowing extremist politics to shape the party. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=986.18s)]
*  If Republican politicians aren't playing enough of a sort of gatekeeper role on this, if they are [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=991.86s)]
*  not quickly and uniformly and unequivocally condemning this sort of thing, which I hear you [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=998.1800000000001s)]
*  would make a difference in terms of how much space is kind of unlocked for these groups to operate in [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=1002.34s)]
*  on the right, is there anything else that the rest of the country can do to try to mitigate the harm [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=1007.7s)]
*  that's caused by this type of embrace by a figure like Trump? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=1014.58s)]
*  I mean, the list of actions that we've taken to try to mitigate the harm that's caused by this type [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=1019.3800000000001s)]
*  of thing, the list of action needed is long and extensive. One of the big ones is I think I've [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPW8oVuVyts&t=1026.58s)]
