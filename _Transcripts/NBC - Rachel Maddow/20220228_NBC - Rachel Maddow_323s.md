# Clinton Hails Global Unity Against Putin's Threat To Democracy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc)
*  Joining us now live is former Secretary of State, First Lady, Senator, presidential nominee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=0.0s)]
*  Hillary Rodham Clinton. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=5.28s)]
*  Madam Secretary, thank you so much for making time to be here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=6.76s)]
*  I really appreciate you accepting our invitation. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=9.0s)]
*  Happy to talk with you tonight. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=12.68s)]
*  First, let me just ask you if you think we're asking the right questions here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  When you look at this war, when you look at these past five days, what do you think is [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=20.04s)]
*  the most important thing for the American people to understand? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=24.2s)]
*  I think all of your questions are really important, but I would put a big umbrella over them, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=28.4s)]
*  Rachel, for the American people, really for citizens of all democracies, that this may [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=35.2s)]
*  at first be somewhat confusing for those who are looking at it from the outside, but make [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=43.72s)]
*  no mistake. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=49.06s)]
*  This is not just an unprovoked, aggressive invasion by Russia. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=50.92s)]
*  It is an effort by Putin and those who prop him up and enable him to really wage war on [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=58.72s)]
*  the rule of law and democracy, on freedom. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=67.44s)]
*  And it's critically important that, as we've seen in the last days, that democratic governments [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  and people rally to support Ukraine in this struggle because it's also our struggle. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=79.34s)]
*  In terms of the Western response, I will not be the first observer to note that the speed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  and unanimity of the Western world's response has been a surprise. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=94.08s)]
*  The idea that the Russian sanctions at this point would be multilateral, that even banking [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=99.76s)]
*  would involve countries like Singapore and Switzerland of all places, that the Russian [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=107.2s)]
*  Central Bank would be sanctioned, that countries like Germany, which for very good historical [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=112.2s)]
*  reasons, don't send weapons abroad, would be sending weapons directly into Ukraine to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=118.48s)]
*  help them, the European Union would be sending in weapons. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=122.92s)]
*  I think it is a remarkable show of single purpose by the Western world to help. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  And it also feels like, while it simultaneously feels like more than we can imagine, it also [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=133.73999999999998s)]
*  feels like not enough. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=137.23999999999998s)]
*  How do you view the Western response thus far? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=139.94s)]
*  Well, I agree with you that it is remarkable. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=142.33999999999997s)]
*  I give President Biden and the Biden administration a lot of credit for leading the world to this [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=145.98s)]
*  point. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=153.66s)]
*  The strategy of disclosing intelligence to demonstrate very clearly that Putin was trying [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=155.72s)]
*  to do once again what he had done before, use disinformation, false flag operations [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=163.44s)]
*  in order to try to justify an unjustifiable invasion, was incredibly smart, unprecedented, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=169.94s)]
*  and it seems to have really woken up so much of the world and stymied Putin. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=178.68s)]
*  And bringing not just Europe, but as you say, countries as far-flung as Singapore, even [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=184.38s)]
*  Japan and others, to understand that this threat was global. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=190.86s)]
*  It certainly is a direct threat to Western democracies right in the heart of Europe. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=195.5s)]
*  But to let an autocrat do what Putin decided to do is something that everybody has a stake [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=201.86s)]
*  in trying to stop. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=209.54s)]
*  So up until now, the kind of economic pressures that have been brought to bear, I think, are [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  not only remarkable, but seem to be really biting. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=217.8s)]
*  And the second point you make, providing necessary weapons to Ukraine has begun. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=221.32000000000002s)]
*  It needs to be accelerated. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=229.08s)]
*  The Ukrainians need Stinger missiles to shoot down Russian aircraft. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=230.60000000000002s)]
*  They need Javelin missiles to stop tanks. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=234.88s)]
*  They need a lot of ammunition. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  They need as much support as they possibly can be given, because it is a two-prong approach now. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=240.58s)]
*  The president, Zelensky, who has been extraordinary and deserves the thanks and gratitude, appreciation, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=249.78s)]
*  admiration of all of us, is trying to operate on two levels. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=257.66s)]
*  He's trying to continue to rally his people to fight the Russian invaders. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=262.5s)]
*  But he's also saying, look, I'll talk to you. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=270.92s)]
*  I don't know what can come of it, because that is a possible way out. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  If the Ukrainians, with our help, can impose enough economic pain on Putin and, sadly, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=278.36s)]
*  the Russian people, combined with providing weapons, that that might be the only way that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=287.04s)]
*  right now I can see us getting to a stalemate that might save the Ukrainian people from [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  even greater tragedy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9BGOE_eVQc&t=299.74s)]
