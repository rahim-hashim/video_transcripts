# Mind-Bending NASA Feat Serves As Inspiration For Attempting Important Work
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A)
*  If you leave Earth and head toward Mars, about seven million miles away in that direction, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=0.0s)]
*  there's a little tiny asteroid called Didymos. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=7.24s)]
*  This is a view of Didymos from a telescope here on Earth. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=10.0s)]
*  This was footage that was taken in July. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=12.4s)]
*  It's real footage. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=14.84s)]
*  It's sped up about 900 times. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=15.84s)]
*  Didymos is an asteroid. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=18.52s)]
*  It orbits the sun just like we do. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=20.32s)]
*  It takes about two years to go all the way around the sun. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=21.92s)]
*  And even though Didymos is little, it also, like us, has a moon, has its own little moon [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=24.52s)]
*  lit, which circles around Didymos like a moth around a flame, just like our moth, our moon [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=30.0s)]
*  circles around us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=35.6s)]
*  That little moon lit is so small you can't even see it from here on Earth. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=37.92s)]
*  But we know it's there because when it crosses between us and Didymos, the light that we [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=41.92s)]
*  can see from Didymos dims for a second and then brightens. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=48.72s)]
*  So we know that there's something there that is passing around between us and Didymos. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=52.56s)]
*  We know that little moon lit is circling around. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=56.36s)]
*  But it takes a little less than 12 hours for that little moon lit to make it all the way [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=58.32s)]
*  around that asteroid. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=61.76s)]
*  Little less than 12 hours. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=63.76s)]
*  That's how long it takes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=64.76s)]
*  Or at least that's how long it took before tonight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=65.76s)]
*  Because we, Earthlings, maybe just changed that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=69.24s)]
*  About 10 months ago, NASA launched a rocket at that little moon lit. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=74.6s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=79.44s)]
*  The hope was that the rocket would smash into the moon lit and knock it off course, nudge [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=80.44s)]
*  it just enough to change its orbit. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=84.44s)]
*  Something like this had been tried before in the movies. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=87.14s)]
*  It had never before been tried in real space before tonight. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=89.38s)]
*  A couple of hours ago, the smash happened. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  And we've got footage thanks to an onboard camera on the NASA rocket. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=98.74s)]
*  This is what the asteroid and its moon looked like as the NASA rocket approached. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=102.6s)]
*  And then a few minutes later came the moment of impact. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=108.26s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=111.34s)]
*  3, 2, 1. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=113.14s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=118.14s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=120.14s)]
*  Awaiting visual confirmation. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=122.14s)]
*  Alright. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=127.14s)]
*  We got it? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  Waiting. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  And we have impact. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  A giant leap for humanity in the name of planetary defense. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=137.14000000000001s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  The signal drops, the image drops because the camera was on the rocket. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  That successfully smashed into that little moon lit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=149.14000000000001s)]
*  It worked. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=152.38s)]
*  Now you may be wondering, why did we do this? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=153.38s)]
*  What is the point of demolishing a perfectly good spacecraft and whacking into a perfectly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=155.34s)]
*  good little moon lit asteroid thingy that never did anything to us? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=159.54s)]
*  Well, the point, as you heard the NASA staffer say there, is for humanity and in the name [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=163.34s)]
*  of planetary defense. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=169.86s)]
*  The point is the survival of life on Earth. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=171.58s)]
*  This mission is a test to see whether humanity can deflect an as yet undiscovered asteroid [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=174.58s)]
*  that God forbid might be heading right for our planet, whose impact could obliterate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=181.14000000000001s)]
*  life on our planet the way that asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=185.58s)]
*  it smacked into us. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=191.68s)]
*  We're awaiting data from this mission to tell us whether the technique worked, whether [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  the moon lit was nudged and would land somewhere else if it were coming at us. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  Sort of waiting for the proof of concept, if you will. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=204.33999999999997s)]
*  But basically they were aiming to hit this little thing and they hit it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  And you know, who knows if one of the things humankind is ever going to be called upon [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=211.1s)]
*  to do is shoot a spaceship into an asteroid to avert a collision that will wooly mammoth [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  us all into mass extinction. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=218.76s)]
*  We don't know if we'll ever need this skill, but if we do need it, clearly we should work [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=220.98s)]
*  on developing it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=225.94s)]
*  We should get going on that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=227.18s)]
*  This test tonight was to prove the concept that we can do it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  Turns out we can do it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=232.74s)]
*  There is a lot of cynicism in the world, in our country in particular, a lot of ideological [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=235.86s)]
*  undercutting of the idea that governments can do anything. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=240.78s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=244.02s)]
*  I think we can all agree that saving Earth from mass and instant death from above would [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=245.02s)]
*  be a good thing to be able to do. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=249.06s)]
*  So yay for the asteroid moonlit direct hit thing tonight. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  So proving that the government can do that, proving we can do something important like [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=255.02s)]
*  that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=259.58s)]
*  I mean, it's more than its own reward. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=260.58s)]
*  So let it inspire us in ways large and small. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAD5nFoPF8A&t=265.56s)]
