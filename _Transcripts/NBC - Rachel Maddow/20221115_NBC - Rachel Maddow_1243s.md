# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Nov. 14
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM)
*  Joining us now live is Senator Chuck Schumer. Senator, thank you so much for making time to be here tonight, sir, and congratulations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was good at that restaurant. You know, people got on their emails that we had won and the whole restaurant broke out in cheers. It was just wonderful. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=7.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. I hope you left a big tip. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=16.0s)]
*  Thank you. I'm a big tipper. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=20.0s)]
*  So let me get your response tonight to this new news that we've just had within the last half an hour or so. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=25.0s)]
*  Forty five minutes out of Arizona. NBC News is now projecting that the Democratic candidate Katie Hobbs has defeated Republican Kerry Lake in that state. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, it's first great news, obviously. Kerry Lake was a very dangerous person. She's very smooth talking, but very, very dangerous and had hard right views. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=38.0s)]
*  And if she is defeated in a state like Arizona, which is a purple state, it should send another message, another shockwave through the Republican Party that when you embrace this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=49.0s)]
*  mega Republican right wing extremism, you lose candidate after candidate had lost who just about every one of the extreme people who wanted to undo the next election, denied this election or lost. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=59.0s)]
*  And as I've said, I hope this is a lesson to the mainstream Republicans. Now, we don't agree with the mainstream Republicans on so many different things, but I hope it's a lesson to them that if they embrace this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=74.0s)]
*  mega Republican Trump ism, they're going to lose the American people. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=86.0s)]
*  This is one great thing, Rachel. A lot of people doubted the fidelity democracy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=91.0s)]
*  And with reason, we saw the election deniers when you do not when you're a political party that denies an election. That's the beginning of autocracy, the end of democracy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=96.0s)]
*  So they saw these election deniers. They saw the violence on January 6. They saw much other threats, threats of violence, even against innocent poll workers who were just trying to do their job. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=106.0s)]
*  And they said democracy is eroding and the American but democracy's roots. They may be quiet, but they run deep. And the American people, not just liberal Democrats, but moderates and even conservatives said this mega Republican Party is against everything that democracy is all about. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=117.0s)]
*  I can't vote for them. And I predicted this in August. I said there was going to be about 10 to 15 percent of the electorate who is going to who normally might vote Republican who is going to not vote for them because of this embrace of Maga. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=134.0s)]
*  So my hope, my plea really to the non-magga Republicans in the Senate is work with us. We will be willing to compromise because the main one of the second reason we were on one is we got real things done. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=147.0s)]
*  We took on big oil and got the biggest climate bill ever done. We took on pharma and finally put a limit on prescription drug prices. We took on the NRA and actually passed some good gun legislation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=160.0s)]
*  We didn't. The people saw two things. They saw us fighting for things they cared about and succeeding. And they saw the Republicans at the maga extreme. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=172.0s)]
*  And they put those two things together with the fine candidates we ran who were very decent, honorable and very successful, effective people. And that clinched the election for us. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=180.0s)]
*  This will happen again if the Republicans continue to embrace Maga. So the warning, the clarion call to the non-magga Republicans is work with us. And people say, well, they won't. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=192.0s)]
*  Well, one other point of the six major bills we passed in June and July and August, which woke America up that we could do things. Five were bipartisan. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=205.0s)]
*  The big one IRA was not because Republicans wouldn't do anything on climate, wouldn't go after pharma. But things like the gun bill, the chips bill, which brought American jobs back here and said we're not going to let China take over our or any other country take over our chip fab industry. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=213.0s)]
*  The bill that said the Veterans Administration had to deal with those veterans who were exposed to the burn pits. All of those and many other things passed in a bipartisan way. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=231.0s)]
*  And so I'm hopeful and I'm not. You know me well, but they're going to do that. They're going to say that path doesn't work. We don't need every Republican to do. We don't even need half. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=239.0s)]
*  We just need a group that we can work with. And we're willing to meet them part of the way. I'm going to give up our principles, but meet them part of the way to get more things done for the American people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=249.0s)]
*  Let me ask about one of these that's going to come up fairly quick. I understand that you today filed cloture on a bill to codify marriage equality to make it federal law that same sex couples have the right to marry. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=260.0s)]
*  I mean, clearly you are worried that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court is going to, you know, is basically coming for people's marriages and they're going to try to take away that right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=273.0s)]
*  What is your expectation in terms of moving cloture on this today? There will be the first votes on Wednesday. Are you expecting Republicans to join Democrats in supporting us? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=282.0s)]
*  Yes. Our two lead Republicans on this. I asked two people to be our leaders on this. Tammy Baldwin and Kirsten Sinema. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=291.0s)]
*  And they came back when it first came that the Republican in the House, 30 Republicans voted for marriage equality, much to our surprise and delight. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=298.0s)]
*  Put it right on the floor. Some people said, well, Sinema and Baldwin are leads on this said to us, we're not going to get the votes if you do it now. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=307.0s)]
*  But we're quite certain that if you do it after the election, we will get it done. And, you know, my job is to get things done, get things done. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=316.0s)]
*  I know that some people said just make it an issue, show where the Republicans are. But the American people and particularly LGBTQ plus people who want the right to marry. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=323.0s)]
*  And by the way, it's personal to me. I have a daughter who has a beautiful wife and they're expecting a baby in a few months. Isn't that great? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=333.0s)]
*  People want us to get things done. People want us to get things done. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=341.0s)]
*  And I'm optimistic based on what I know and what our two lead senators know that we will get the votes to get this done. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=347.0s)]
*  And it'll be it'll say to that Supreme Court, just like we want to say to them, get your hands off women's bodies. We want to say figuratively, of course, we want to say to them, let people marry who they love. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=355.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=367.0s)]
*  Your majority will either be 50 50 with Vice President Harris as a tiebreaker or or it will be 51 49 depending on what happens with Senator Warnock's runoff election in Georgia on December 6. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=369.0s)]
*  Can you explain to me and to our audience what the practical difference is in terms of how the Senate runs? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=381.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously you've been at 50 50 these past couple of years. It required a power sharing agreement with the Republicans. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=388.0s)]
*  How different would the Senate be? How different would your life be? How different would your ambitions be if it was 51 49 instead of 50 50? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=394.0s)]
*  It's it's not one percent different. It's very different for the better. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=401.0s)]
*  For one thing, any time a judge or a nominee to the administration, we've had a lot of good progressive nominees gets a vote out of committee. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=406.0s)]
*  That's, you know, 10 10. That's time delays things for a week. You have to go to the floor. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=414.0s)]
*  You have to get the time and you have to bring Kamala Harris there and do what's called a motion to discharge out of committee. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=420.0s)]
*  If we have 51, there'll be no more motions to discharge. It will mean appointees and judges will get appointed much more quickly. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=427.0s)]
*  And, you know, we've had a great record with judges. We've set the record as of today, actually, 83 new judges, two thirds women, half people of color and progressive judges, not just partners in law firms and prosecutors, but legal aid attorneys and immigration lawyers and consumer advocates, things like that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=434.0s)]
*  So that'll make that a lot easier. The second thing it does is you can get different bills out of committee much more quickly. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=454.0s)]
*  Third, we can have subpoena power with 50 50. You can't really get subpoena power. So it means it's a lot easier to get things done. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=461.0s)]
*  And one other thing when you have 50 senators and obviously any one senator can say I'm not voting for it unless I get this this or this when it's 51. It's harder to do. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=470.0s)]
*  So you put all that together. Plus that extra seat helps us in 2024. Keep the majority. I'm always trying to think ahead. It's a it's a world of difference. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=479.0s)]
*  And Raphael Warnock is just a great person. He's been a great senator for Georgia. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=487.0s)]
*  Service has been his motto, whether as a pre as a minister at the Ebenezer Baptist Church as a senator. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=492.0s)]
*  He's the person who took the lead on getting insulin in Medicare only to cross thirty five dollars instead of the six seven eight hundred dollars. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=500.0s)]
*  He's one of the people who's taken the lead so that disadvantaged farmers in Georgia for farmers will get some help. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=509.0s)]
*  They have been discriminated against in the past. He's one of the people who took the lead on expanding the ACA. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=514.0s)]
*  So more people got health care and it was cheaper issues that really mattered to people. Warnock has already produced. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=521.0s)]
*  So if I was a Georgian and this race is going to be decided only by Georgians, I'd say this guy produces for me. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=527.0s)]
*  I've got a lot of rhetoric and bombastic serious stuff. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=534.0s)]
*  Senator Schumer, one one last question for you that the point that you just made a moment ago about how one any one senator when it's fifty fifty can stand up and decide they're going to throw a wrench in the works. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=538.0s)]
*  You know, if it's not what I want exactly, then I'm going to stop everything. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=548.0s)]
*  This is a little bit delicate to say, but we all know that it was really Senator Sinema, who you just mentioned a moment ago for her leadership on the marriage equality bill and also Senator Manchin in West Virginia. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=551.0s)]
*  Who were the ones who were kind of throwing the wrench in the works more often than anybody else. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=564.0s)]
*  Are you 100 percent sure that neither of them is considering switching to the Republican Party so they could be the star once again and in an even bigger way so that they could sort of monkey wrench this whole process? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=569.0s)]
*  Well, they look they had very difficult positions. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=581.0s)]
*  I've disagreed with them rather strongly in many ways, but they've kept being Democrats. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=586.0s)]
*  It would have been easy for them to do it, you know, in the past, but they have strong beliefs different ways. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=591.0s)]
*  Senator Sinema is passionate on LGBTQ rights. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=597.0s)]
*  Senator Sinema is leading pro-choice. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=602.0s)]
*  You wouldn't find much of a home in the Republican Party there, I suppose. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=604.0s)]
*  Their mansion has been very progressive on certain issues as well, including prescription drugs. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=607.0s)]
*  And so, you know, I don't I think they they differ from us in many ways, but I don't think either of them would be comfortable with the Republican Party. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=614.0s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who I should mention was himself just reelected and who also is about to start another term as Majority Leader in the United States Senate. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=624.0s)]
*  Sir, it's an honor to have you with us tonight. Thank you so much and congratulations. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=633.0s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. Good to be with you. Thank you. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=636.0s)]
*  Right now, according to NBC's projection, Republicans could get, say, two hundred and nineteen seats, which would give them a very, very, very tiny majority. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=639.0s)]
*  I should tell you that projection has a plus or excuse me, it's two hundred and twenty seats is the projection right now. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=650.0s)]
*  Has a margin of error, though, of plus or minus four seats. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=655.0s)]
*  And so even if they do get control, it's going to be a very, very, very, very slim majority. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=658.0s)]
*  We've seen a few tiny house majorities in history. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=665.0s)]
*  Washington Post actually did a good reminder today of when we have had really, really, really wafer thin majorities in the House in the past and what the consequences have been. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=667.0s)]
*  One of those rare instances was right as the U.S. entered World War One. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=677.0s)]
*  Another one was right around the events of 9 11. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=682.0s)]
*  In both of those cases, big world changing world events ended up sort of outpacing what was otherwise expected to be total partisan gridlock. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=685.0s)]
*  But there's other cases where partisan gridlock ended up being what held the day. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=694.0s)]
*  And that can be a very consequential thing, too. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=698.0s)]
*  In the spring and summer of 1932, we've talked about this a few other times on the show, tens of thousands of U.S. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=701.0s)]
*  veterans, World War One veterans marched down Pennsylvania Avenue and they set up camps outside the U.S. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=707.0s)]
*  Capitol in Washington. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=713.0s)]
*  It was, of course, was the Great Depression. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=714.0s)]
*  The veterans came to D.C. to demand bonuses that they were due. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=716.0s)]
*  The government had promised them bonuses for their active duty service and they hadn't paid them out. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=720.0s)]
*  And so the veterans came to Washington to get their money. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=725.0s)]
*  They called themselves the bonus army. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=727.0s)]
*  It ended horribly when the veterans refused to leave. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=730.0s)]
*  President Herbert Hoover called in the U.S. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=733.0s)]
*  military and sick to the military on them to throw the veterans out bodily. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=735.0s)]
*  Now, how did it get to that point, to that act of desperation by the veterans and that monstrous decision by President Hoover to sick the military on them? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=740.0s)]
*  Well, it was gridlock. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=748.0s)]
*  Congress had debated the awarding of those bonuses for years. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=750.0s)]
*  There was some congressional support for them. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=753.0s)]
*  Republicans at the time were opposed to paying the bonuses. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=755.0s)]
*  They had a one seat majority in the Senate. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=758.0s)]
*  That was enough to bottle it up in the Senate. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=760.0s)]
*  The House had a Democratic majority, but it was a really small one. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=762.0s)]
*  It was a 219 to 212 majority in the House, too small of a majority for the Democrats to be able to get things done there either. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=766.0s)]
*  That's the sort of thing that can happen with a very, very slim majority in Congress, particularly if you've got a slim majority in both houses. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=775.0s)]
*  I mean, unless you've got some sort of major world event that unites political enemies, partisanship can very easily block even very important stuff when majorities are that thin in Washington. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=782.0s)]
*  Now, there's been a lot of discussion about what it would take for Republicans to be able to pass legislation in a very narrow majority in the House. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=794.0s)]
*  I think in real politic today in 2022, looking at the House Republicans and what they want to do, I don't think anybody expects them to actually have real legislation that they want and expect to pass. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=802.0s)]
*  I mean, even if they did have goals for legislation, they've been quiet about them thus far. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=812.0s)]
*  They didn't run on those goals, and they're not going to want to pass anything that the Democratic controlled Senate would vote for anyway, let alone something that would be signed into law by Joe Biden. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=816.0s)]
*  What I think that means for a wafer thin Republican House majority in practical terms in all likelihood, it means that we will see them pass nothing in terms of legislation. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=825.0s)]
*  The consequence of them having a majority, even a one seat majority, is that they will control the committees and they will therefore control subpoena power and they will therefore be able to turn themselves into an investigation machine. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=836.0s)]
*  A scandal generating body of government where they investigate everything Joe Biden has ever done thought Eaton Drake or gesture that in his entire life. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=850.0s)]
*  That is going to be the consequence of the House going to the Republicans if in fact that is the way it goes. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=859.0s)]
*  A narrow majority is a recipe for them passing nothing. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=866.0s)]
*  I doubt they care very much about that. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=869.0s)]
*  But even a one seat majority is what they need to be able to control the committees, launch investigations. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=871.0s)]
*  And honestly, that's all they want anyway. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=877.0s)]
*  This did look like trouble at the time. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=881.0s)]
*  This was the headline. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=883.0s)]
*  Comey and McCabe, who infuriated Trump, both faced intensive IRS audits. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=885.0s)]
*  Michael Schmidt at the New York Times reporting in July that of all the tens of millions of taxpayers in this country, somehow two of the people Donald Trump hated most got picked, supposedly at random, for an audit so invasive that tax lawyers joke about it as a [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=891.0s)]
*  An autopsy without the benefit of death. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=904.0s)]
*  That was the Times reporting back in July. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=907.0s)]
*  Now that already troubling story has gotten significantly worse. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=909.0s)]
*  Trump's longest serving chief of staff, John Kelly, the one you see holding the door for his boss here. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=914.0s)]
*  John Kelly now tells the New York Times that yes, those those audits were instigated because Trump asked for them. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=920.0s)]
*  Those those audits were instigated because Trump asked for them. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=928.0s)]
*  Quote, yes, Trump wanted IRS investigations of his foes. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=932.0s)]
*  John Kelly telling reporter Michael Schmidt, quote, I would say it's inappropriate. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=937.0s)]
*  It's illegal. It's against their integrity. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=940.0s)]
*  And the IRS knows what it's doing. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=942.0s)]
*  It's not a good idea. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=943.0s)]
*  Kelly says Trump responded, quote, Yeah, but they're writing bad things about me. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=944.0s)]
*  For the record, the former president is denying these allegations from John Kelly, a spokesperson for the former president called John Kelly today a psycho. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=949.0s)]
*  That was what the spokesperson said. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=959.0s)]
*  He's a psycho. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=961.0s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=962.0s)]
*  Why did you pick a psycho to be your longest serving chief of staff? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=963.0s)]
*  But this is a big deal and a potentially criminally big deal for anybody at the IRS who might have gone along with this kind of improper pressure. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=967.0s)]
*  And also for Donald Trump, if he in fact asked for this sort of thing to be done, it is a federal crime for anyone, including the president, to request even indirectly an audit of anyone. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=976.0s)]
*  It's against the law to abuse the power of the IRS in that way. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=987.0s)]
*  If Trump asked for it, it's illegal. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=991.0s)]
*  If Trump asked for it in the IRS, then did it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=993.0s)]
*  It's illegal on a couple of different levels. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=996.0s)]
*  When this story first emerged this summer, it appeared likely that the Treasury Department would investigate the issue. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1000.0s)]
*  We're told tonight that a report from that inspector general investigation is actually expected quite soon. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1005.0s)]
*  If we get anything definite, we will let you know. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1011.0s)]
*  But for now, you can add this new reporting on the potential criminal actions of abusing the power of the IRS. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1014.0s)]
*  You can add that to the pile of legal worries that the former president has arrayed against him right now. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1021.0s)]
*  Just today, he defied a lawful subpoena to testify to the January 6th investigation in Congress. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1027.0s)]
*  He today remains in legal jeopardy in the state of Georgia, where a grand jury continues to investigate the effort to overturn the 2020 election results in that state. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1034.0s)]
*  Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is reportedly testifying in that federal grand jury, excuse me, in that state grand jury criminal investigation tomorrow morning. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1043.0s)]
*  Trump also remains in legal jeopardy over the classified documents he's alleged to have taken when he left the White House. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1052.0s)]
*  Plus, his company is actively on trial right now in New York on criminal charges of fraud. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1058.0s)]
*  Plus, the New York attorney general is continuing a civil suit against that company for alleged fraud. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1064.0s)]
*  And so, of course, in that propitious environment, Donald J. Trump has decided that tomorrow is the perfect day for him to announce that he's writing again for president. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1072.0s)]
*  Right. Since everything else is going his way anyway, and people are just clamoring for his return, nobody has ever declared a run for president, not just under a cloud, but enveloped in a suffocating fog of scandal. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1080.0s)]
*  With legal jeopardy still unfolding across multiple states and jurisdictions. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1095.0s)]
*  Nobody has ever announced a run for the presidency under those circumstances. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1100.0s)]
*  But for whatever reason, that is apparently going to change tomorrow. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1105.0s)]
*  Congratulations to us. Presidential history about to be made on our watch in the worst possible way. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1108.0s)]
*  Take, for instance, the race for the state House seat representing the 142nd Legislative District in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1116.0s)]
*  I know you've been laser focused on it at home. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1125.0s)]
*  That race is currently separated by 114 votes. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1128.0s)]
*  But I'll tell you why that race has potentially national implications. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1132.0s)]
*  Right now, Republicans have 100 seats in the Pennsylvania State Legislature, Pennsylvania State House. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1136.0s)]
*  Republicans have 100 seats. Democrats have 100 seats in the Pennsylvania State House. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1142.0s)]
*  It is 100 to 100 in Pennsylvania right now. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1148.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania Democrats have said that they are going to reclaim the Pennsylvania House, which I think would be the first time in more than a decade that they have been in control there. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1152.0s)]
*  But there are three races left there to be called. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1160.0s)]
*  One of them will be settled by a special election because the Democrat who won that seat handily last week had actually died before Election Day. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1163.0s)]
*  That seat will likely go Democratic again. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1171.0s)]
*  And there's that Bucks County race that's separated by 114 votes. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1174.0s)]
*  Then there's a Montgomery County, Pennsylvania race, which is separated by 14 votes, literally 14 votes. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1177.0s)]
*  So partisan control of the Pennsylvania State House and all that means it might change hands for the first time in in 12 months. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1185.0s)]
*  But it's going to come down to one race. That's about 100 votes and one race. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1192.0s)]
*  That's about a dozen just in case you needed motivation to know that your vote really counts. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1196.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ilui_gATM&t=1222.0s)]
