# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: June 6
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk)
*  Sedition is a crime. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=0.0s)]
*  Sedition is a serious crime, one with a 20-year prison sentence. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=2.0s)]
*  Seditious conspiracy is a conspiracy to use force to stop the U.S. government from carrying out its laws [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=5.0s)]
*  or to overthrow the government. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=12.0s)]
*  Sedition and seditious conspiracy are crimes for obvious reasons. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=15.0s)]
*  But in modern American life, the U.S. Justice Department has had a heck of a time actually securing convictions [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=19.0s)]
*  when they charge people with that crime. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=25.0s)]
*  And all of us who can observe that modern history know that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=27.0s)]
*  You can just see that in the history of modern sedition prosecutions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=32.0s)]
*  There's all of these incredibly dangerous people charged with incredibly terrible things, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=35.0s)]
*  with incredibly damning evidence brought against them, who are nevertheless acquitted [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=41.0s)]
*  because the crime is so hard to prove in court. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=45.0s)]
*  We can all observe that just as citizens, seeing when these high-profile, sort of hair-curling prosecutions are brought. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=48.0s)]
*  We can all see it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=54.0s)]
*  But you know who can really see it? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=55.0s)]
*  Prosecutors who work for the U.S. Department of Justice. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=57.0s)]
*  They really know acutely how hard it is to get a prosecution in a sedition case. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=60.0s)]
*  They know it even more acutely than we do because the acquittals in those big, high-profile failed sedition cases, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=67.0s)]
*  those loom very large in the history of high-stakes, highly-charged failed prosecutions by the U.S. Department of Justice. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=74.0s)]
*  Federal prosecutors know this history very well, and they therefore know not to bring sedition charges lightly. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=83.0s)]
*  And yet, here we are. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=92.0s)]
*  In January of this year, U.S. Justice Department brought seditious conspiracy charges against 11 members of the Oath Keepers, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=95.0s)]
*  a right-wing, pro-Trump paramilitary group that allegedly played a key role in the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=104.0s)]
*  to try to keep Trump in power on January 6th of last year. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=112.0s)]
*  Since that sedition indictment in January, three different members of the Oath Keepers have pled guilty and started cooperating with police. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=115.0s)]
*  In April of this year, there's another guilty plea, another cooperation deal with a member of a different right-wing, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=124.0s)]
*  pro-Trump paramilitary group, the so-called Proud Boys. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=131.0s)]
*  And now today, five members of the Proud Boys have themselves been hit with seditious conspiracy charges. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=136.0s)]
*  And I know this may sort of feel like a continuation of that earlier story from January, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=142.0s)]
*  but I cannot underscore strongly enough how unusual it is [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=149.0s)]
*  and what a big deal it is at the U.S. Justice Department for sedition charges, for seditious conspiracy charges to be charged by the U.S. Justice Department. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=154.0s)]
*  I mean, in modern times, sedition charges are rare enough and a risky enough prosecution effort [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=164.0s)]
*  that there are literally books written about every modern case in which sedition has been charged by the government, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=171.0s)]
*  because it is such a big deal when they do it, it is so rare and it is so high stakes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=176.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're under the age of 100 and you were going to go to work as a federal prosecutor for the U.S. Justice Department, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=181.0s)]
*  it would be a pretty good bet that you would never see this particular charge brought against anyone ever in your entire career. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=186.0s)]
*  And yet now here we are, 16 people from two different paramilitary groups charged in two different sedition indictments in the space of six months. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=192.0s)]
*  The Oath Keepers seditious conspiracy indictment brought in January, now the Proud Boys seditious conspiracy indictment brought today, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=201.0s)]
*  both related to the January 6th violent attack on the U.S. Capitol to try to overthrow the U.S. government, to try to prevent President Biden from taking office. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=211.0s)]
*  The fact that Justice Department prosecutors have brought these cases, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=220.0s)]
*  knowing the history of how difficult it is to secure a conviction in cases like this, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=224.0s)]
*  the fact that they have brought these cases against two different groups over the course of six months implies a certain confidence on the part of the Justice Department [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=230.0s)]
*  about what a good case they've got. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=240.0s)]
*  I really do think that by the Justice Department's own history, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=244.0s)]
*  prosecutors are sort of hardwired to not use these particular charges unless they really feel like they've got it dead to rights. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=247.0s)]
*  But now they've done it. They did it in January. They did it again today. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=254.0s)]
*  This drama that you walk through the door, it would kill any COVID on your body. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=273.0s)]
*  When you leave, it would kill the virus as you leave this product. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=279.0s)]
*  They don't want to talk about that. They don't want to hear about that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=283.0s)]
*  I'm Raphael Warnock and I approve this message. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=288.0s)]
*  That's a new campaign ad from Democratic Georgia U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=292.0s)]
*  showing his Republican Senate opponent pushing a mist, a magic mist that can clean you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=296.0s)]
*  He says he has this magic mist. He uses the magic mist to turn doorways into 100 percent cures for COVID. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=304.0s)]
*  That is the kind of ad you can run when your opponent is Herschel Walker. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=313.0s)]
*  There's a reason Mr. Walker refuses to show up, refused to show up for his primary debates [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=317.0s)]
*  when he was running to become the Republican nominee for Senate in Georgia. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=323.0s)]
*  I mean, if your candidate accidentally veered into, I have a magic mist cure for COVID right here and no one wants to hear about it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=327.0s)]
*  If your guy veered into that territory every time he got behind a microphone, you'd probably try to keep him away from a microphone, too. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=334.0s)]
*  We will see if he agrees to debate Raphael Warnock now that he is the Republican nominee for Senate in Georgia. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=340.0s)]
*  Herschel Walker really is the Republican Party's nominee for Senate in Georgia, which does seem kind of crazy. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=347.0s)]
*  Then again, is that any crazier than the candidate Republicans chose for Senate in Pennsylvania? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=354.0s)]
*  After all, that candidate has also been accused of peddling his share of snake oil cures for various real ailments. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=360.0s)]
*  Even how he ended up being the Republican candidate for Pennsylvania is still a mystery. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=369.0s)]
*  The Republican Senate candidate, Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, is a man who is from Ohio. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=375.0s)]
*  He has a home in Florida. He votes in New Jersey. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=380.0s)]
*  He has no discernible connection to Pennsylvania whatsoever. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=384.0s)]
*  But alongside Herschel Magic Mist Walker as the Republican Senate candidate in Georgia, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=388.0s)]
*  the no connection to Pennsylvania guys who Republicans have picked to be their Senate candidate in that state as well. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=395.0s)]
*  Then again, is Mehmet Oz being the Republican Pennsylvania Senate candidate any crazier than the candidate Republicans chose as their nominee for governor in Pennsylvania? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=402.0s)]
*  He, after all, is a sword wielding election denier who has been subpoenaed by the January 6th investigation to talk about, among other things, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=414.0s)]
*  his role in putting forth a fake slate of Trump electors from Pennsylvania, even though Trump lost Pennsylvania. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=422.0s)]
*  With each new primary election this year, the Republican Party has made sort of increasingly wild choices [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=431.0s)]
*  for who their nominees are going to be to represent them in November's elections. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=438.0s)]
*  Well, tomorrow we're going to get more because tomorrow there are primary elections in seven more states. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=443.0s)]
*  And if you are looking to see who might be the next list, the next guy on the list of this amazing cast of characters Republicans have been nominating this year, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=450.0s)]
*  you may want to pay particular attention to Montana, Montana Republican congressional contender Ryan Zinke. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=459.0s)]
*  If that face is familiar to you, if that name sounds familiar to you, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=467.0s)]
*  it's probably because you remember him from one of his 18 gazillion different scandals during his time as Trump's interior secretary. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=471.0s)]
*  And I mean, when I say 18, it wasn't 18 gazillion, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=480.0s)]
*  but it really was 18 different federal investigations involving Ryan Zinke during his time as a Trump cabinet member, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=484.0s)]
*  like the time he spent $12,000 of taxpayer money so he could fly in an oil executive's private plane, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=491.0s)]
*  or the time he allegedly spent $139,000 taxpayer dollars on a set of fancy new doors for his office, $140,000 worth of doors, really? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=497.0s)]
*  Or the time he overruled federal experts to block a Native American casino project right after he met with lobbyists from a rival casino giant. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=507.0s)]
*  Or the time he allegedly tried to get an executive from the oil company Halliburton to build Mr. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=516.0s)]
*  Zinke his own microbrewery at a time when Halliburton had business before the Interior Department. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=522.0s)]
*  Ryan Zinke was this is tough competition. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=527.0s)]
*  Ryan Zinke, though, was was perhaps the most scandal plagued member of the Trump cabinet. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=532.0s)]
*  If you just look at scandals sort of by volume in terms of the number of months he served versus the number of formal federal investigations that had to be opened into his conduct. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=537.0s)]
*  Ryan Zinke really set some records. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=549.0s)]
*  I mean, him and Scott Pruitt were kind of neck and neck. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=551.0s)]
*  But Ryan Zinke was really something. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=553.0s)]
*  And tomorrow, Republicans are going to decide whether or not they're going to make Ryan Zinke the latest in this year's very long string of quite amazing Republican candidates for office. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=555.0s)]
*  One thing to note about these hearings in terms of making your plans to watch the primetime hearing this week and to stay up on these hearings as they continue through next week. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=565.0s)]
*  We, of course, will be covering the January 6th committee hearings live right here on MSNBC. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=576.0s)]
*  As I mentioned, the first primetime one, our coverage will start at 7 p.m. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=581.0s)]
*  This Thursday night, I will be helping anchor that coverage joined by many of my colleagues, including Chris Hayes and Nicole Wallace and Joy Reid and Lawrence and Ari and lots of different folks from MSNBC. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=584.0s)]
*  It'll be a team effort in covering the January 6th hearings, starting with our special coverage this Thursday night at 7 p.m. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=595.0s)]
*  Eastern. But I also want to let you know, on top of that, not only are we going to be airing the hearings live here on MSNBC as they happen. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=602.0s)]
*  So you can plan ahead. I want it. I want you also to know that all of the hearings are also going to be available on the podcast feed for this show. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=610.0s)]
*  The hearings themselves and the pre and post hearing analysis that we're going to be doing on MSNBC. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=619.0s)]
*  You can get the audio of that in its entirety and for free on the podcast feed of my show. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=624.0s)]
*  So if you already subscribe to the Rachel Maddow Show podcast, thank you. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=630.0s)]
*  You don't have to do anything else. If you don't already subscribe, just go to whatever podcast provider you use. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=634.0s)]
*  Type my name, Maddow, into the search bar. Subscribe to the Rachel Maddow Show. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=639.0s)]
*  It's all free. You will find that at that podcast feed, we will have all of our normal content, the audio of this show, for example. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=644.0s)]
*  But also once the hearings start, that is where we are going to post free and in its entirety, the audio of all of the January 6th committee hearings, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=651.0s)]
*  plus the pre analysis and the post analysis when those hearings happen. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=660.0s)]
*  Joining us now is the new United States Ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=666.0s)]
*  She joins us live from the U.S. Embassy in the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=670.0s)]
*  Ambassador Brink, I really thank you for being here tonight. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=674.0s)]
*  I appreciate you making the time, especially given what time of the night it is right now in Ukraine. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=676.0s)]
*  Rachel, thanks so much. It's great to be with you. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=683.0s)]
*  Let me ask you first about the decision to move the embassy back to Kyiv. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=687.0s)]
*  Obviously, that is something that the Ukrainian government wanted and that some other countries have done. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=692.0s)]
*  The United States has done this just within the past few weeks. You're just there within the past week. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=697.0s)]
*  Is it a physical danger to yourself and other U.S. personnel to have the embassy there, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=702.0s)]
*  particularly with those missiles that we saw Russia shoot into the Ukrainian capital this weekend? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=707.0s)]
*  Well, I would just say diplomacy is risky and we are here because we think it's important. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=715.0s)]
*  It's in our national strategic interest to try to ensure that borders are not changed by force. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=722.0s)]
*  And to do that job, in part, you need people on the ground. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=728.0s)]
*  So myself and my team, we're very aware of the risks that are at play. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=733.0s)]
*  We very much try to mitigate them. President Biden, Secretary Blinken, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=739.0s)]
*  we all have total confidence in efforts that they are making to mitigate those risks. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=744.0s)]
*  And we try to do it and I try to do it myself as ambassador. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=749.0s)]
*  But what I heard on the Hill during my confirmation hearings was from Congress was a lot of interest in getting us back. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=753.0s)]
*  I personally wanted to get back and the president wanted us to be present. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=760.0s)]
*  So I'm proud to be here with a group of very patriotic Americans and to represent the U.S. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=764.0s)]
*  Foreign Service, the diplomatic arm of our government. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=770.0s)]
*  We don't fight with weapons. We fight with ideas and words. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=775.0s)]
*  And my number one job here is to try to help Ukraine defend itself. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=779.0s)]
*  In terms of Ukraine's ability to defend itself, I think that so many Americans who have been horrified by the invasion [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=785.0s)]
*  and who are supportive of the people of Ukraine and what they are contending with in this war. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=792.0s)]
*  I live in western New England and in multiple states driving around this part of the country. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=798.0s)]
*  I see people putting out Ukraine flags in front of their houses, not with other political messages or anything, just support for Ukraine. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=802.0s)]
*  I think because there is so much support for Ukraine in the United States, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=810.0s)]
*  I worry that perhaps the U.S. government, that perhaps the U.S. media is telling the American people [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=814.0s)]
*  what they want to hear about Ukraine's likelihood of succeeding in this effort [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=822.0s)]
*  and that we are more interested in hearing about Ukrainian bravery and Ukrainian success [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=827.0s)]
*  and the Russians falling short of expectations than we are in hearing news to the contrary. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=832.0s)]
*  Is that fair to worry about that? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=838.0s)]
*  And do you have a different view of how things are going in the war now, these 100 days into it? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=840.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's actually a great question. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=848.0s)]
*  I mean, there is no doubt that due to Ukrainian bravery and ingenuity, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=850.0s)]
*  the Russians have had to pull back and refocus on the East and the South of the country. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=855.0s)]
*  It's amazing. It's remarkable. It's a David and Goliath story that's in real life. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=860.0s)]
*  The president is incredibly brave and is leading his people in this resistance to this unprovoked aggression. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=866.0s)]
*  But also the average person on the ground is resisting as well. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=875.0s)]
*  So I think that what's happening now in the East is the fighting, as your intro said, is very close, very difficult. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=880.0s)]
*  Ukrainians are losing a lot of soldiers every day. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=890.0s)]
*  It's why it's so important that we work with partners and allies to continue to provide as much security assistance [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=893.0s)]
*  as they need to prevail, to defend themselves. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=901.0s)]
*  And that's what I'm doing on the ground and working with, of course, Washington and then other allies and partners that are on the ground here in Kiev. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=904.0s)]
*  But yes, this is going, I guess what I would say to the American people. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=913.0s)]
*  And I felt this overwhelming support just for our presence, for our team that is here, for our people. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=917.0s)]
*  When I was back in America, I felt it obviously from the administration, but also from Congress. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=923.0s)]
*  And also, you know, I'm from the Midwest and I felt it from friends and family that I grew up with. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=929.0s)]
*  So that's great. I would just say this is not going to be easy and it's going to take some time. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=935.0s)]
*  And I think it's now a very difficult battle in the East. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=941.0s)]
*  And it's it's more now more important than ever that we continue to offer this support. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=945.0s)]
*  With the Russian Federation handing out Russian passports to Ukrainians who live in the East with Vladimir Putin [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=952.0s)]
*  recognizing the purported independence of parts of eastern and southeastern Ukraine with Russian occupying forces [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=960.0s)]
*  telling Ukrainians they need to trade in the ruble and replacing Ukrainian education and media outlets with with those that are that are derived from Russia. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=969.0s)]
*  It does seem like Putin is trying to make the Russian takeover of large parts of Ukraine the de facto way of life in that part of the country. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=980.0s)]
*  President Zelensky has talked about one fifth of Ukrainian territory now being occupied by by Russian forces. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=992.0s)]
*  Is it the position of the U.S. government that any diplomatic solution, any potential ceasefire has to respect the original integrity of Ukraine's borders [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=999.0s)]
*  or is it possible that Ukraine is going to lose large large swaths of its territory in negotiations to end the war? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1009.0s)]
*  Well, you've got it exactly right. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1019.0s)]
*  This is part of the Russian playbook in terms of the giving out passports and incorporating parts of countries into Russia. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1021.0s)]
*  I mean, this is what has happened in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria, among other places in this part of the world. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1030.0s)]
*  So it's not surprising. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1038.0s)]
*  The United States has long recognized Ukraine, Ukraine within its international borders. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1040.0s)]
*  And we also have we consider Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1046.0s)]
*  So we are letting the Ukrainians decide when or how they will negotiate. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1053.0s)]
*  As President Zelensky said, and President Biden also affirmed, all wars end in some kind of negotiation. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1059.0s)]
*  But we're supporting Ukraine as it fights right now to defend itself. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1066.0s)]
*  How important are the new advanced weapons that President Biden has approved sending to Ukraine? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1072.0s)]
*  I think for those of us who don't come from a military background, we hear about anti-tank weapons. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1079.0s)]
*  We hear about artillery. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1084.0s)]
*  We hear about howitzers. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1087.0s)]
*  We're now hearing about guided rocket systems as the type of weapons and the amount of weaponry that the United States sends continues to expand. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1089.0s)]
*  Is there something that we civilians should understand in terms of the enhanced capability that we are offering the Ukrainians by giving them these more advanced weapons that are newly arriving now? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1098.0s)]
*  Well, they are very important and it really signifies, I think, our support because they are advanced weaponry. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1110.0s)]
*  They also signify the way in which the battle has changed from what was required in Kiev in the capital when there was fighting in urban areas where now it's fighting in the Donbass, which is the area in the east. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1118.0s)]
*  And it's very flat. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1135.0s)]
*  And so the fighting is basically artillery. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1137.0s)]
*  And it's from from many from far away. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1140.0s)]
*  Positions are far away from each other. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1144.0s)]
*  So this this weaponry is more appropriate for the current fight. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1146.0s)]
*  We also hope that allies and partners will also support Ukraine with this kind of weaponry. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1150.0s)]
*  And we will continue our very, very close consultations with them in order to adjust the security assistance that we're providing to meet the needs that they have. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1157.0s)]
*  The United States ambassador to Ukraine is Bridget Brink. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1167.0s)]
*  Madam Ambassador, the whole country obviously is very acutely aware of you and your whole diplomatic staff there. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1172.0s)]
*  The danger that you saw that you all are putting yourselves in to do this important work. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1178.0s)]
*  Good luck to you. Come back anytime. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1182.0s)]
*  We'd love to have you back on the show and thank you for what you do. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1184.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel. It's really great to see you and be here. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7DQAvpFFk&t=1188.0s)]
