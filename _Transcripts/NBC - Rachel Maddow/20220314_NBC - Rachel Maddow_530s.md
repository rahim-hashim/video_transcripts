# U.S. Right-Wing Conspiracy Theory Feeds Russia New Excuse For Waging War On Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA)
*  I want to play you a clip of a segment that aired on Russian state-controlled TV station [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=0.0s)]
*  NTV over the weekend. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=5.2s)]
*  It was a segment about the completely false conspiracy theory that there are U.S.-funded [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=7.9s)]
*  biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=12.94s)]
*  Part of the Russian network's evidence for the existence of these weapons labs were clips [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=16.72s)]
*  from Fox News, with U.S. elected officials like the Republican Senator Ron Johnson and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  the former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard claiming that the U.S. hasn't been [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=26.78s)]
*  telling the full truth about this issue. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=31.86s)]
*  Here's another Russian TV segment from this weekend where a different Russian TV network [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=34.86s)]
*  just played a huge chunk of Tucker Carlson's Fox News show translated into Russian. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=39.660000000000004s)]
*  I have to play a second for you with the sound on because the Russian translator tries to [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=44.86s)]
*  mimic Tucker's performance while speaking. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=50.22s)]
*  It's quite funny. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=53.18000000000001s)]
*  Do Ukraine have biological weapons? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=54.18s)]
*  Ukraine has biological research facilities. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=58.18s)]
*  What? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=62.18s)]
*  Other than being very funny, it's also deeply concerning. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=63.18s)]
*  You see the banner under there, Under Secretary of State, Ukraine has bio labs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=69.38s)]
*  Now what Carlson is doing in this segment is taking a statement from Victoria Newland, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=75.78s)]
*  U.S. Under Secretary of State, completely out of context. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=80.82s)]
*  She's confirming that the U.S. does have biological laboratories in Ukraine like we have all over [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=84.89999999999999s)]
*  the world. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=90.46s)]
*  Labs that work like the CDC to monitor diseases and to prevent outbreaks. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=91.46s)]
*  They're not weapons labs. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=95.46s)]
*  But look at how far Carlson took that from its actual context. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=97.66s)]
*  Here's the clip that I just played for you originally in English. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=101.86s)]
*  Under oath in an open committee hearing, Victoria Newland just confirmed that the Russian disinformation [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=107.82s)]
*  they've been telling us for days is a lie and a conspiracy theory and crazy and immoral [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=113.14s)]
*  to believe is in fact totally and completely true. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  Whoa, indeed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=123.53999999999999s)]
*  What Carlson is saying there is not true. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=126.94s)]
*  There are no biological weapons labs in Ukraine, let alone bio weapons labs funded by the U.S. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=129.1s)]
*  But we now know, thanks to reporting out of Mother Jones, that Tucker Carlson's show [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=134.58s)]
*  falls so in line with the fake narrative the Kremlin is trying to push that the Kremlin [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=139.62s)]
*  actually sent out a memo to Russian media outlets instructing them to literally play [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=144.58s)]
*  more of it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=151.06s)]
*  Quote, it is essential to use as much as possible fragments of broadcasts of the popular Fox [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=152.06s)]
*  News host Tucker Carlson. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=158.78s)]
*  End quote. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=161.06s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=162.06s)]
*  It's been deeply alarming watching Russians and Chinese controlled state media go all [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=163.54s)]
*  in on this fake bio lab story. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=167.98s)]
*  It's a level of propaganda coordination that we've never seen before between those two [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=170.9s)]
*  nations and it's all the more alarming now that U.S. officials are warning that all this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=175.22s)]
*  talk about these Ukrainian bio weapons labs might be a pretext for Russia using chemical [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=180.44s)]
*  or biological weapons of their own in Ukraine. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=185.22s)]
*  That's a huge concern given all of the allegations of war crimes that have already been committed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=189.82s)]
*  We also have this new and honestly hard to believe concern at home in the United States [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=194.82s)]
*  because U.S. conservative media has become at best a useful idiot for Russian propaganda. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=199.1s)]
*  Tucker Carlson is the most visible piece of that but he's just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=206.5s)]
*  The larger piece of all of this conspiracy theory, it's coming from the underbelly of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=210.9s)]
*  a place that most of us do our best not to spend time in. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=217.3s)]
*  I hope you don't. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=220.5s)]
*  I certainly don't. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=221.5s)]
*  But luckily we have NBC senior reporter Ben Collins who is willing to spend a ton of time [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=222.5s)]
*  in the dark weird corners of the Internet for us. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=227.86s)]
*  Joining us now Ben Collins, NBC News senior reporter. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=231.78s)]
*  He covers what he calls the dystopia beat. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=233.94s)]
*  Ben, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=236.34s)]
*  This one is deeply alarming. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=238.86s)]
*  You have covered a lot of garbage on the Internet but this one is alarming because you have [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=240.58s)]
*  described how these things sort of start on the underbelly of the Internet. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=245.06s)]
*  They work their way up to Fox News and then they spread out now being used by the Russians [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=248.02s)]
*  and the Chinese to justify some things that they are doing or might do in Ukraine. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=252.82s)]
*  Yeah, let's be very clear about this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=258.1s)]
*  This specific conspiracy theory started in the English speaking American far right on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=261.34s)]
*  a website called Gab. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=267.1s)]
*  Eight days before the invasion there was a user that posted the bio labs that they said [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=269.46s)]
*  were all over Ukraine that were being used in their eyes to build bio weapons. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=275.62s)]
*  Now these are research facilities. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=279.65999999999997s)]
*  They are not creating bio weapons there for the United States government but it fit into [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=281.02s)]
*  that larger narrative that made sense in the far right that Anthony Fauci is building bio [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=285.42s)]
*  weapons and releasing them all throughout the world to create the coronavirus to lock [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  the world down. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=293.9s)]
*  All that stuff. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=294.9s)]
*  It made a lot of sense. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=295.9s)]
*  The problem is the Russians hadn't really thought of this conspiracy theory before the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=296.97999999999996s)]
*  invasion. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=299.94s)]
*  You know, before the invasion they didn't talk about it at all. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=300.94s)]
*  Until the 24th, the day they invaded Ukraine, the American far right seized on this bio [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=304.62s)]
*  labs conspiracy theory. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=309.94s)]
*  In fact, you know, they weren't really taking to this denazification narrative. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=311.46s)]
*  So they were turning on Vladimir Putin in the far right and the QAnon spaces as well. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=317.38s)]
*  But this bio lab conspiracy switched everything around. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=322.08s)]
*  In the last week, they have turned back to being effectively pro Vladimir Putin in the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=325.54s)]
*  QAnon and pro Trump spaces. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  And then Russian propaganda took that American propaganda that was created in these far right [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=332.46000000000004s)]
*  spaces in the QAnon forums and on GAB and made it their own. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=338.38s)]
*  Let's talk about it reminds us of the theories that COVID-19 was deliberately started in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  a lab and spread out. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=351.1s)]
*  Does this start and live in those kinds of places? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=353.18s)]
*  Yeah, that account on GAB was an anti-vax accounts. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, that's the remaining legacy of the anti-vax spaces on the Internet. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=360.18s)]
*  They are conforming to be part of the broader global far right to push these conspiracy [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=365.14s)]
*  theories against the Bidens, against Anthony Fauci and against what they would call like [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  the medical establishment all throughout the world. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=374.86s)]
*  The global far right has coalesced around that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=377.3s)]
*  And it's worked for Russia, too. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=379.5s)]
*  In fact, you know, the TASS, the Russian news agency, they didn't post anything about biological [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=381.73999999999995s)]
*  weapons attacks that were created in Ukraine in the run up in the one month before the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=388.29999999999995s)]
*  invasion in Ukraine. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=394.65999999999997s)]
*  But on Thursday and Friday, they posted 24 separate articles about what they called biological [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=396.26s)]
*  weapons in Ukraine. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=401.52s)]
*  This was this has become their pretext for this war. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=403.2s)]
*  And it's stemmed from the American anti-vax communities in the American communities. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=407.94s)]
*  We've seen Fox News and and their personalities get behind some very unusual things prior [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=415.02s)]
*  to this war. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=420.5s)]
*  This trucker protest in Canada, something that was really egged on by far right media, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=421.78s)]
*  but including Fox News at some point when the Russians, the Russian government starts [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=426.18s)]
*  telling Russian state media to quote and continue to use run clips from Tucker Carlson and Fox [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=430.18s)]
*  News. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=437.7s)]
*  Does does Fox have some response to that? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=438.7s)]
*  Are they out there saying, hey, well, hold on a second. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=440.02s)]
*  This is not meant to be stuff that goes into Russian propaganda. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=442.62s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=448.42s)]
*  Not that we've heard. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=449.42s)]
*  However, I will say that there is going to be a line at some point between the real reporters [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=450.42s)]
*  who are in Ukraine getting hurt. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=454.41999999999996s)]
*  There was an injured reporter for Fox News in Ukraine today in the people who are aligning [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=456.7s)]
*  with the crisis actor, people who are saying, you know, this this invasion is justified [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=462.66s)]
*  or that this is this invasion isn't really happening at all, which is a sort of choose [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=467.86s)]
*  your own adventure that's happening from Russian propaganda right now. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  So eventually, I'm pretty sure those reporters who are in these cities getting shelled and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=475.42s)]
*  watching children die in the street will want to step up and tell their colleague over there [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=480.54s)]
*  at Fox News in his cabin in Maine that maybe this is realer than he wants to let on to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=486.1s)]
*  his audience. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  This would be a good night to do it, given that the State Department reporter for Fox [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  News has been injured by shelling in Russia as you in Ukraine, as you say, Ben, thanks [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=500.14000000000004s)]
*  very much for your reporting. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=505.82s)]
*  Ben Collins, NBC News senior reporter. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=506.82s)]
*  We appreciate your time as always. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdLpDCD_qsA&t=508.66s)]
