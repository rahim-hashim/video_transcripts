Video Description: How much will Americans get to know about the people Donald Trump is choosing to run the U.S. government? In the absence of any real vetting the way it's usually done, Rachel Maddow presents a Rachel Maddow Show Public Servant Announcement to hopefully help fill that gap. In this episode, Rachel takes a closer look at Trump's choice for administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz, who brings the endorsement of "magic" pills to what has been called "the most challenging technical, policy and political job in government," and questionable business ties to a job that oversees over a trillion dollars a year.

# Rachel Maddow on Dr. Mehmet Oz: Five things about Trump's pick to lead Medicare & Medicaid Services
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ)
*  In the absence of any normal vetting or background check process at all for Donald Trump's nominees [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=0.0s)]
*  to run the U.S. government, we're hoping that a Rachel Maddow show public servant announcement [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=8.68s)]
*  can help fill in some of the gaps about these folks who are set to get these big important [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=14.52s)]
*  jobs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=19.04s)]
*  Today, we're looking at Trump's choice for something that has been called probably the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=20.04s)]
*  The most challenging technical, policy and political job in government. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=24.48s)]
*  The most challenging. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=30.46s)]
*  This is a job that oversees a trillion dollars plus in spending every year. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=33.08s)]
*  A trillion. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=39.4s)]
*  This job oversees health care for more than 150 million Americans. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  It's Medicare and Medicaid and Obamacare and kids' health insurance, everything. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  And again, this is considered to be maybe the single most technically difficult job [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=50.68s)]
*  in the whole U.S. government. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=55.84s)]
*  And there's a reason you don't know the name of anybody who has ever held this job before. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=58.6s)]
*  It's because these are not famous people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=65.0s)]
*  These are not the kind of people you have heard of. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=67.88s)]
*  The people who can do this particular job are just not run-of-the-mill folks who pop [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=69.68s)]
*  up in all sorts of different political jobs and you've heard of them. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=76.86s)]
*  This is a really nerdy, really specialized job for someone with incredible policy jobs. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=80.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=86.36s)]
*  This is for somebody who's got incredibly arcane, deep, technocratic, government, bureaucratic [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=87.36s)]
*  expertise. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=94.96s)]
*  It is a job that Donald Trump has chosen to give to this guy who does have nine daytime [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=97.44s)]
*  Emmy Awards. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=106.16s)]
*  That's an achievement that Trump actually listed in writing when describing the qualifications [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=108.26s)]
*  of the man he has chosen to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a man [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=113.98s)]
*  named Dr. Mehmet Oz. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=120.14s)]
*  And you know, I mean, nine daytime Emmys is nine daytime Emmys. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=122.18s)]
*  I'm not really sure what else you need to know, but just in case, here are five additional [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=128.82s)]
*  things to know about Dr. Mehmet Oz. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=133.22s)]
*  Mehmet Oz won those nine Emmy Awards for his daytime TV show in which he mixed sort of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=137.66s)]
*  normal health advice with other stuff. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=145.94s)]
*  For example, the miracle of red palm oil, which he calls, quote, a revolutionary new [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  way to live years longer. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=158.4s)]
*  He says, quote, it's red color is perfect because I think of it as a stop sign for aging. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=160.72s)]
*  Dr. Oz suggested to his viewers that red palm oil can protect you from Alzheimer's. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=167.0s)]
*  He also has promoted raspberry ketones. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=175.0s)]
*  He calls them, quote, the number one miracle in a bottle to burn your fat. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=178.42s)]
*  Also green coffee beans. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=184.76s)]
*  Quote, you may think that magic is make believe, but this little bean has scientists saying [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=186.66s)]
*  they have found a magic weight loss cure for every body type. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  This miracle pill can burn fat fast. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=198.85999999999999s)]
*  On his daytime TV show, Dr. Oz hosted psychics who told his audience they could help them [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=204.56s)]
*  talk to dead people. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Oz on his show told his audience that astrological signs, you know, like Sagittarius [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=211.28s)]
*  or whatever, quote, may reveal a great deal about our health. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=218.04s)]
*  He told his audience that red onions can protect you from cancer. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=223.94s)]
*  He set off a national panic over apple juice. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=228.56s)]
*  He told his audience that the way you get breast cancer is by putting your cell phone [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  in your bra. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=236.17999999999998s)]
*  Dr. Oz introduced his audience to a man who he described as a scientist with expertise [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=238.34s)]
*  on genetically modified food. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=243.06s)]
*  The man's only scientific credential was a business degree from a school run by the yoga [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=245.94s)]
*  guru who was most famous for telling his followers that he can teach them to fly. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=251.08s)]
*  Dr. Oz on his show repeatedly hosted a doctor who says that vaccines give you AIDS and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=258.14s)]
*  also narcolepsy, who himself promoted an Italian quack who says that cancer is a fungus [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=264.18s)]
*  and it can be cured by taking baking soda in an IV drip. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=271.64s)]
*  That guy went to prison for manslaughter, by the way. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=276.48s)]
*  So that's thing number one. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=280.48s)]
*  Thing number two. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=282.6s)]
*  After years of him doing that kind of thing with his daytime TV show, in 2015 a group [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=283.6s)]
*  of prominent doctors got together and made an appeal to the medical school with which [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=289.84s)]
*  Oz was affiliated. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  They called on the medical school basically to fire Dr. Oz for endangering the public. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  They said quote, Dr. Oz has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=303.26s)]
*  treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain and has repeatedly shown disdain [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=310.38s)]
*  for science and for evidence based medicine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=316.42s)]
*  Now Dr. Oz did not respond directly to those charges in the letter or to the lead author [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  of the letter calling him quote, a quack and a fake and a charlatan. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=326.86s)]
*  But he did say through a spokesman quote, I bring the public information that will help [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  them on their path to be their best selves. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=336.68s)]
*  Nevertheless the medical school, the hospital he was affiliated with without spelling out [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=343.18s)]
*  exactly why, they did ultimately cut ties with Dr. Oz a few years later when he announced [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=347.0s)]
*  a run for Senate in Pennsylvania whereupon a second group of doctors launched a road [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=353.06s)]
*  tour. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=359.5s)]
*  A road tour that was called Real Doctors Against Oz. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=360.5s)]
*  These doctors traveled all across the state of Pennsylvania warning people that they should [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=365.24s)]
*  Dr. Oz to the Senate because he posed what they as doctors said was quote, a major threat [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=369.78s)]
*  to public health. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=374.78s)]
*  Dr. Oz simply isn't trusted by real medical professionals. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=375.94s)]
*  Thing number two. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=382.21999999999997s)]
*  Thing number three. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  Last year Dr. Oz announced that he had become a global advisor and stakeholder to something [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=386.2s)]
*  called iHerb. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=392.3s)]
*  Iherb? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=393.3s)]
*  I think maybe we're just going to call it iHerb. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=394.3s)]
*  They sell various vitamins and pills and potions over the internet. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=401.90000000000003s)]
*  Ashwagandha has been shown to help balance thyroid hormones and plays a crucial role [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=407.26s)]
*  in metabolism, energy levels and mood regulation. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=410.62s)]
*  By supporting your thyroid, Ashwagandha can help you feel more energized and balanced [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=413.3s)]
*  throughout the day. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=417.54s)]
*  Ashwagandha has been shown to help balance thyroid hormones. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=419.54s)]
*  It supports your thyroid says man on TV. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=423.86s)]
*  Man with nine, count them nine daytime Emmys. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=426.98s)]
*  If you watch to the very, very end of that video past the point where he's done extolling [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=430.62s)]
*  the virtues of Ashwagandha for your thyroid, Dr. Oz does take a very brief moment to mention [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=434.54s)]
*  that if you do have any kind of pre-existing thyroid condition, maybe check with your doctor [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=441.62s)]
*  before starting any kind of new regimen. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  And that of course is a good thing. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=450.62s)]
*  It's a particularly good thing in this case, considering that entities like the Cleveland [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=452.58000000000004s)]
*  Clinic, they don't say that Ashwagandha is going to balance your thyroid hormones. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=456.18s)]
*  What they say is for some pre-existing thyroid issues, taking the supplement can actually [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=461.1s)]
*  make it worse. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=466.82s)]
*  He's also promoted supplements from this company that he says, quote, probably slowed down [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=469.5s)]
*  his mom's Alzheimer's. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=475.14s)]
*  He's repeatedly hyped weight loss drugs and then marketed the same company's supposed [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=478.06s)]
*  cures for the side effects from those weight loss drugs. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=482.53999999999996s)]
*  There's also been a complaint against him filed with the FTC that alleges that he hasn't [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=486.74s)]
*  been disclosing his financial ties to this company when he has been shilling for all [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=490.86s)]
*  their stuff, which he has continued to do even after Trump named him to be the head [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=496.14s)]
*  of the U.S. government's trillion-dollar health agency. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=502.42s)]
*  Because, yeah, why should a little government job like that stop you from cashing in on [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=505.1s)]
*  stuff that, you know, probably cures Alzheimer's? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=508.94000000000005s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=512.74s)]
*  Call now. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=513.74s)]
*  Operators are standing by. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=514.74s)]
*  Thing number four. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=518.9s)]
*  Dr. Oz once ran for the United States Senate. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=520.78s)]
*  He ran for a Senate seat in a state where he did not live. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=523.5400000000001s)]
*  For the 2022 election, Dr. Oz announced that he was running for Senate in the great state [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=529.1s)]
*  of Pennsylvania, and that, of course, is a fine and proper thing for anyone to do if [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=533.34s)]
*  they live in Pennsylvania. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=537.1800000000001s)]
*  The problem with his run is that he lived in New Jersey. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=539.34s)]
*  And we know that because he once invited People magazine to do an MTV Cribs style tour of [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=544.3000000000001s)]
*  his New Jersey mansion, which has six bedrooms and eight bathrooms, we learned on the tour. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=551.54s)]
*  I mean, there's more bathrooms even than all the bedrooms. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=558.74s)]
*  It's like spare bathrooms, extras for anyone. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=563.02s)]
*  But none of them are in Pennsylvania. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=566.62s)]
*  Dr. Oz told People magazine that he and his wife had lived in this house, which, again, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=568.5799999999999s)]
*  is in New Jersey for 20 years, which is why people were understandably confused when he [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=573.62s)]
*  launched a campaign for Senate in a nearby but still totally separate and distinct U.S. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=580.56s)]
*  state. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=585.92s)]
*  That got worse and weirder for him in the last few months leading up to his campaign. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=586.92s)]
*  When he was insisting that he was now a full-time permanent resident of Pennsylvania, he said [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=590.92s)]
*  his in-laws had a house in Pennsylvania and he was paying them rent to stay there. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  But simultaneously in the lead up to his campaign, he also posted more than 20 photos on Instagram [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=602.3599999999999s)]
*  from his New Jersey mansion. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=609.8s)]
*  So that's thing number four. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=614.28s)]
*  And finally, thing number five. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=616.78s)]
*  If Dr. Oz actually gets this job, he would be in charge of, again, a trillion dollar [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  agency overseeing health care for over 150 million Americans, one of the most complex, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  technically demanding, specialized and bureaucratically sophisticated jobs in all of government. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=630.76s)]
*  As a medical doctor and a TV host with, yes, nine daytime TV Emmys, but zero experience [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=639.08s)]
*  working in government, Dr. Oz has nevertheless shown a little leg about his approach to the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=646.72s)]
*  ethical and financial complexities that he might confront at scale at this new trillion [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=653.2800000000001s)]
*  dollar government job. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=658.6800000000001s)]
*  During the COVID crisis, for example, he used his TV show and more than two dozen appearances [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=661.36s)]
*  on Fox News to hype one particular drug as what he described as essentially a miracle [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=666.88s)]
*  cure for COVID. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=674.8399999999999s)]
*  He not only hyped it on TV over and over and over again, he also lobbied the Trump family [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=676.2399999999999s)]
*  directly to promote this drug. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=680.5s)]
*  He advocated that the FDA should give the drug emergency authorization as a treatment [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=682.64s)]
*  for COVID. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=687.9599999999999s)]
*  The drug, sadly, turned out not to work against COVID at all. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=690.0s)]
*  It had no effect on COVID. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=695.0s)]
*  The people who took it were more likely to die than people who didn't take it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=696.56s)]
*  But what no one knew while Dr. Oz was promoting the bejesus out of this one drug was that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=701.4799999999999s)]
*  he and his wife held hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies that [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=707.2399999999999s)]
*  made the drug. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  And that turns out to be kind of a theme with him. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=715.2399999999999s)]
*  If he does get this gig from Trump, this trillion dollar gig, one of the things he's going to [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=718.4399999999999s)]
*  be in charge of is Medicare. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=724.16s)]
*  And one of the things Oz has shilled for more aggressively than almost anything else, more [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=725.9599999999999s)]
*  than the magic fat burning raspberry stuff and the green coffee, more than the magic [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=730.48s)]
*  lavender oil, he says will fix your leg problems. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=738.62s)]
*  If there's one thing he really, really, really, really wants to sell you, it is privatized [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=741.88s)]
*  Medicare. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=747.12s)]
*  Medicare Advantage is run by private health insurance companies for profit. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=749.16s)]
*  It competes with traditional Medicare. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=752.82s)]
*  And Dr. Oz is associated with a company that is one of the most aggressive known telemarketers [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=755.2600000000001s)]
*  that calls up old people to convince them to give up their Medicare and sign up with [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=763.0600000000001s)]
*  one of these for profit plans instead. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=766.38s)]
*  He in fact has advocated that everyone in the country should be signed up for one of [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=769.22s)]
*  these private plans, which means in other words, he wants to privatize Medicare, which [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=772.62s)]
*  itself is a big deal. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=777.7s)]
*  But separate and apart from him wanting that as a policy for the country, what nobody knew [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=781.66s)]
*  until he had to file his financial disclosures for that failed Senate campaign from a state [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=789.2199999999999s)]
*  he didn't live in, what nobody knew about his shilling for all these privatized Medicare [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=793.5799999999999s)]
*  plans, what nobody knew about that until his financial disclosures came in was that while [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=798.88s)]
*  he was shilling and shilling and shilling for these privatized Medicare plans, he owned [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=803.2199999999999s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in two of the companies that sell these [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=808.9s)]
*  plans. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=813.4599999999999s)]
*  It is kind of a theme for him. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=815.62s)]
*  Ka-ching! [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=818.86s)]
*  But there you have it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=820.62s)]
*  Five things to know about Donald Trump's pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=821.6999999999999s)]
*  Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=826.74s)]
*  This has been a Rachel Maddow Show Public Servant announcement. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-Dsiz5EyQ&t=829.86s)]
