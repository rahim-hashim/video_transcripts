# Michigan GOP In Chaos As Fealty To Trump's Big Lie Defines Party
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c)
*  Over the weekend, Republicans in Michigan chose their candidates for statewide office [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=0.0s)]
*  in November. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=4.96s)]
*  These will be the Republican candidates in Michigan for secretary of state and attorney [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=5.96s)]
*  general. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=10.0s)]
*  One of those two candidates, the one on the left, spoke at a QAnon conspiracy theory conference [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=11.44s)]
*  late last year. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=16.54s)]
*  She's now the official Republican Party nominee to be secretary of state in Michigan, which [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=17.72s)]
*  means she'll be in charge of overseeing elections for the whole state if she wins in November. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=22.36s)]
*  That prospect is especially frightening in a state like Michigan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=27.36s)]
*  You might remember that during the last presidential election, Michigan's Republican Party came [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=30.16s)]
*  within centimeters of not certifying Biden's election victory, even though he clearly won [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=34.36s)]
*  in Michigan and by a lot. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=40.04s)]
*  In the end, it came down to just one Republican member of a Michigan state canvassing board [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=41.8s)]
*  who resisted tons of pressure from his own party that he should agree to overturn the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  election results. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=51.44s)]
*  He voted to certify Joe Biden's victory. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=53.2s)]
*  Michigan Republicans then decided to retaliate against him. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=56.68s)]
*  They refused to let him keep that job on that state canvassing board. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=58.88s)]
*  They replaced him with a new Republican, a conservative activist named Tony Daunt. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=62.24s)]
*  Well, today, Mr. Daunt, that conservative activist who Michigan Republicans specifically [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=66.72s)]
*  chose for that key election post, today he resigned from his position in the Michigan [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=71.94s)]
*  Republican Party. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=76.6s)]
*  He wrote a letter to party leaders that was obtained by the Detroit News. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=77.6s)]
*  In it, he wrote that, quote, cowardly party leaders have made the election here in Michigan [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=80.52s)]
*  a test of who is the most cravenly loyal to Donald Trump and to relitigating the results [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=86.0s)]
*  of the 2020 cycle. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=91.0s)]
*  Incredibly, rather than distancing themselves from this undisciplined loser, far too many [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=92.4s)]
*  Republican leaders have decided that encouraging his delusional lies and even worse, cynically [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=97.08s)]
*  appeasing him despite knowing they are lies. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=102.12s)]
*  Whether it's misguided true beliefs, cynical cowardice or just plain old grift and avarice, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=105.76s)]
*  it is a losing strategy and I cannot serve on the governing board of a party that is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=110.4s)]
*  too stupid to see that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=115.04s)]
*  Trouble and turmoil in lots of Republican parties, in lots of swing states. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1n1SnYYW2c&t=119.52s)]
