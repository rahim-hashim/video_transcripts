*  with Mariupol with Harkiv that's why we are so desperately asking for support to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=143.35999999999999s)]

*  in Kiev as the city gets surrounded we've heard that it could take 10 days [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=191.48s)]
*  to two weeks to surround the city and then 10 days to two weeks for Kiev to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  run out of critical supplies what tell us what you believe happens then what [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=199.64s)]
*  happens once the Russians have surrounded you and you don't have the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=204.44s)]
*  air support that you're asking the West for first of all even without these air [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=207.35999999999999s)]

*  in two days then an American official said to American journalists that they [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  were given 96 hours to Ukraine and after this we will fail as you see now it's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=227.04s)]
*  almost 20 days and we have not failed and I'm sure we will not fail and Putin [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=233.48s)]
*  could not and he will not encircle here so I believe that our army which is [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  holding the ground will hold it for future if they will penetrate to city [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=247.88s)]
*  people like me civilian militia will fight them on the street but I believe [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=252.56s)]
*  that we will not need to do this and I am absolutely sure that the victory will [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozLUWTi_4A&t=257.32s)]
