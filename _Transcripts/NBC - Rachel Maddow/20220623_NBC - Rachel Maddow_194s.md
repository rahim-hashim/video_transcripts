Video Description: Lawrence O'Donnell and an MSNBC panel talk about how Donald Trump didn't care about the damage he would do to the institution of the Department of Justice if he forced them to help with his election reversal scheme, but he did care that the scandal might end up being a bigger news story than the doubt he hoped to cast on the election.

# DOJ officials Spoke Trump's Cynical Language To Head Off Coup Plot
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g)
*  Pulling Trump into it. I mean that was the other I think the ambient point today is that this wasn't something that was like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=0.0s)]
*  Happening among Trump's advisors and there were you know that crazy pillow guy and Mike Flynn and other people who had these ideas [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=5.44s)]
*  But this was being conducted by Trump personally [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=14.6s)]
*  And our first versions of this White House this Oval Office meeting came from journalists including Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=14.76s)]
*  But the dialogue today was much more dense. It was much more full [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=21.14s)]
*  I was never fully satisfied reading the the the Woodward Costa account of what happened in that room what what I couldn't [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=25.18s)]
*  decide was [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=33.1s)]
*  What why didn't Trump do it? Why didn't he do it? And I believe it's all in the Steve Engle dial [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=34.620000000000005s)]
*  What Engle shows him is this will be the bigger news story [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=40.300000000000004s)]
*  Your letter to Georgia will be a small story [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=46.46s)]
*  This will be a bigger story and that's what the guy understands and he thought yeah, that's right [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=50.26s)]
*  It's gonna in my so my thing won't be page one, which is the mission. So it won't work [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=55.94s)]
*  I don't think he cared about the graveyard. I don't think he cared how many people quit [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  I don't think that was gonna stop him because he knows, you know Nixon did it some people quit [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=66.18s)]
*  So what right but that thing it won't work. The other one will be the bigger story [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=70.74s)]
*  It's a lot of respect for what the Justice Department is or represents and he might it doesn't want to sell it [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=76.3s)]
*  You said something earlier when I had you on in the seven o'clock hour [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=82.06s)]
*  which I thought was also a part of it part two of what you're saying is that Donald Trump understands casting and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=85.58s)]
*  When you bring Jeff Clark in and humiliate him in front of all these other men and he has Donahue was in his dirty [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=91.3s)]
*  Jeans and not dressed for doesn't want to come in his army t-shirt [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=97.38s)]
*  He says no no you come you sit right down here by me [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=100.3s)]
*  And so Jeff Clark now is in this sort of star chamber where he has to decide if he's cast for the role [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=102.66000000000001s)]
*  And they say that guy's a loser. Mm-hmm. That guy's dumb. That guy's not competent [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=108.22s)]
*  He suddenly says oh that can't be my guy. That guy's not the right guy for the job [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't look like remember the one thing you heard Donald Trump criticized about the people and invaded the Capitol was that they didn't look the part [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=115.98s)]
*  They didn't look right. They looked kind of grubby. But in that moment Clark looked too grubby. It's like no he's humiliated [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=121.30000000000001s)]
*  He what did he if he walked into the FBI director's office? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=126.30000000000001s)]
*  Assuming he could find it [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=130.94s)]
*  Chris Ray wouldn't even give him the time of day and would absolutely not [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=133.26000000000002s)]
*  Trump needed to see Clint Eastwood sitting in the Jeffrey Clark chair [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and he needed to see this is the toughest smartest baddest guy in the room instead [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=141.28s)]
*  He's got the nerd in the chair [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  Who's just being kind of verbally slapped around by everybody there and Trump's imagining? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=148.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm gonna put it all on this guy's shoulders and tonight tonight Trump has to wonder is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=153.58s)]
*  Jeffrey Clark my Gordon Liddy is he gonna do five years from me or is he Jeff Magruder? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=159.1s)]
*  He's gonna be the first one to flip and when he flips what does he say? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=165.14s)]
*  You [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RQPHVZw3g&t=188.42s)]
