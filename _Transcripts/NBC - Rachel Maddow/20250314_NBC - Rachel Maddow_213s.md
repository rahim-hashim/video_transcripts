*  Well, the opposition has taken note and criticized us, so I think it's going pretty darn well. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=94.84s)]
*  What's the plan for April 5th and how is that different from the other kinds of actions [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=99.72s)]
*  that you guys have been taking part in? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=103.36s)]
*  For the last several weeks, we've been hearing from old and new Indivisible group leaders, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=106.44s)]
*  Hey, we're all getting together. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=112.08s)]
*  We're doing these actions locally. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=113.08s)]
*  But when do we actually really hit the streets? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=114.56s)]
*  When do we all show up in mass? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=116.68s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=120.44s)]
*  I want to be clear. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=121.44s)]
*  This is not just Indivisible. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=122.44s)]
*  We're partnering with the brilliant folks over at 5051, with labor, with lots of other [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=123.44s)]

*  Anybody, anybody who is watching this can sign up and register in their community to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Look, hands off our jobs, hands off our democracy, hands off our volcano observatories. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=138.76s)]
*  My God, we need to show up because Doge and this administration is negatively impacting [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=143.96s)]
*  all of us in all of our communities. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=149.52s)]
*  So yes, there's going to be a big presence in DC, but it's not just DC. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=151.72s)]
*  I want to see this in rural areas, in suburban areas, in urban areas, in red states, purple [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=157.28s)]
*  states, blue states, and it's going to take all of us. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=161.24s)]
*  So this is an opportunity for all of us to stand up together and demonstrate the power, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=164.04s)]
*  the people power that is against Doge, against Musk, against Trump. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=168.4s)]
*  We're seeing all different, I mean, we've been trying to track it on this show, trying [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=172.4s)]
*  all different kinds of protests from all different kinds of people in all different kinds of [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=176.36s)]
*  places. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=180.56s)]
*  Again, this call on April 5th for everybody to do something together all in that day. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u83738QhnZA&t=181.56s)]
