# Judge sets some restrictions on Trump talking to witnesses; navigates tricky circumstances
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo)
*  We're going to begin tonight in Miami where we're joined by MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=0.0s)]
*  Lisa was inside the courtroom today for the arraignment. Lisa, it's great to have you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=5.12s)]
*  I know it's been a long day already. Thanks for being with us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=8.96s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=13.52s)]
*  Let me just ask you about the nuts and bolts of what happened tonight. Obviously, we all know [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=14.8s)]
*  sort of what an arraignment is, or at least we've all had to learn it to be able to cover this [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=21.84s)]
*  particular ex-presidency. Did the magistrate judge today set any specific parameters in motion in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=25.52s)]
*  terms of what the schedule's going to be like, what's going to happen next, or what we should [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=34.0s)]
*  expect more broadly from the trial proceedings? He did and he didn't, right? This is a magistrate [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=38.8s)]
*  judge who right before he left the bench said, my involvement in this case ends just about now, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=46.4s)]
*  and knowing that he had made perhaps the only joke of that 45-minute proceeding, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=52.96s)]
*  got up from the bench, walked away, and presumably into the sunset where Donald Trump and his legal [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=57.68s)]
*  troubles in the Southern District of Florida is concerned. However, Rachel, he entered two orders [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=62.64s)]
*  that I think are worth discussing. One is an order concerning the production of evidence by the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=67.44s)]
*  government. That's called a Brady order. It stands for United States Supreme Court case that requires [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=72.48s)]
*  the government to produce evidence that has the tendency to exculpate the defendant, put in simple [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=77.6s)]
*  terms, to be helpful to the defendant, to help him in his defense. And that can be anything from [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=84.08s)]
*  evidence that would tend to reduce a sentence to evidence that would undermine the credibility of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  a witness. We haven't seen that order hit the docket yet, and so we don't know the timing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  for the production of that evidence. The rest of discovery will be addressed by Judge Aileen Cannon, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=98.96s)]
*  or if she recuses herself subject to a motion or even voluntarily by another judge. But for right [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=104.24s)]
*  now, that's the only evidence that's being required to be produced. The other thing that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  Magistrate Judge Goodman did that I think is of note is impose a condition that nobody asked for. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=114.64s)]
*  The Department of Justice basically said it would be fine with them if Trump was not subject to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=120.88s)]
*  travel limits, that he's free to travel domestically, internationally, he can keep his passport. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=128.32s)]
*  There's not even a restriction on him holding firearms. But Judge Goodman said what really [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=133.12s)]
*  concerned him was Trump's continued ability to communicate with his co-defendant Walt Nauta [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=139.12s)]
*  and witnesses in the case. He recognized on the other hand that Walt Nauta still works for [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=144.24s)]
*  President Trump and they interact almost every single day. And not wanting to deprive Walt Nauta [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  of his job, what he said was Trump and Nauta can't talk about the case or the facts of the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=154.08s)]
*  case under any circumstances. And then he was about to bar Trump from talking to any witnesses [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=158.72s)]
*  in the case. That's something against which Team Trump fought back hard. Ultimately where it landed [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=164.08s)]
*  is the Department of Justice gets to prepare a list of witnesses that it has concerns about [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=170.16s)]
*  Trump communicating with. And Trump, subject to that list, may not communicate with those people [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=175.6s)]
*  about the facts of the case. That of course necessitates the question, who's going to catch [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=180.8s)]
*  them and is this really in order with any bite? And Rachel, that remains to be seen. The Department [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=186.08s)]
*  of Justice had 13 lawyers in court today. They are certainly not for a lack of resources in this [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  instance. Lisa, let me just make sure that I understand in terms of the way this went and who [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=196.24s)]
*  was asking for what and how the magistrate judge decided today. Was there anything the Department [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  of Justice, the prosecutors asked for today that the judge said no to? Absolutely not. In fact, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  the judge of his own volition is the one who raised the concern about Trump communicating with [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=213.76s)]
*  other people. The Department of Justice appeared to be very happy to go really easy on Donald Trump [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=219.04s)]
*  as a defendant in terms of the condition of his release. It's magistrate Judge John Goodman who [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=224.88s)]
*  was the one who had concerns. And that's not unusual. In fact, he said it's typical in this [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=230.0s)]
*  district where you have co-defendants to prohibit them from speaking to each other. I experienced [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=234.64s)]
*  that in private practice myself when I defended someone in a securities conspiracy case. My client [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=239.04s)]
*  who was a law firm partner and his client, a then CEO of a company, were not allowed to continue [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  talking to each other even though as of until the moment of their arrest, they were still in a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  working relationship together. But Judge Goodman seems sympathetic to the fact that Walt Nata would [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=254.48s)]
*  be out of a job if Donald Trump couldn't communicate with him. And that was one step too far for him. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=259.36s)]
*  Fascinating. MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin. Again, I know it has been a long and intense day [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=264.8s)]
*  already. Thanks for being with us tonight. That was super interesting, my friend. That was really [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=270.08000000000004s)]
*  fascinating. I want to go to all of you guys on this. Ari, let me go to you first. Lisa was there, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=274.0s)]
*  Garrett Haake was there in the courtroom. We've had descriptions from them about some of the things [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  that happened in the courtroom and also just sort of what it felt like, what was unusual, if anything. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  Have you heard anything about the way this court proceeding went today that stands out for you as [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=288.8s)]
*  potentially important in terms of the way it's going to go in the future or just as unusual given [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=293.76s)]
*  who the defendant is in the case? Only that it was longer than usual. Federal arraignments like local [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=298.4s)]
*  arraignments tend to be super quick. And because of the back and forth we just heard about, it went [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=302.96s)]
*  much longer than usual. And he was given a slight amount of deference but not an inappropriate [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=308.8s)]
*  amount. In other words, the mugshot is not supposed to embarrass. It is a identification technique. I [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=313.52s)]
*  think it is fully reasonable for the federal government here through the Justice Department [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  and the courts to say the defendant's been identified and so they didn't do that. Nicole and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=322.72s)]
*  I were talking today, I mean he left a lot of fingerprints on the documents on his attempts to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=328.48s)]
*  lie to the government with his lawyers and now today he got fingerprinted. And so there is that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=333.68s)]
*  very real aspect of this where it doesn't mean he's guilty, he's legally presumed innocent, but he is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=339.12s)]
*  being treated under the law as a defendant with all that comes with that. So he's not in control [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=345.68s)]
*  in the courtroom. He was quiet, he had the lawyer enter the plea, he was forced to sit there quietly [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  and they have means, which is why he knew to be quiet, to enforce that in the same way he was under [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=358.48s)]
*  the control under the booking and arrest of the United States government. So for a time today, for [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=364.4s)]
*  the first time ever, the federal government that he used to run was basically supervising him and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=369.6s)]
*  there's a lot more where that came from if you are convicted. Can I ask Ari a question if you don't [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=375.12s)]
*  mind? We're just going to interrogate Ari. Because I can't wrap my head around the Waltine Nauta, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=379.44s)]
*  Donald Trump situation. So they're sitting there together, at one point Nauta's lawyer, the one he [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=387.44s)]
*  has, he couldn't even complete the process because he doesn't have a lawyer that has a bar license [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=394.4s)]
*  in the state of Florida, starts talking with Trump's lawyer. So their lawyers are talking. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=399.44s)]
*  Then Nauta marches out behind Trump. Lisa Rubin painted the picture. It was very strange. He walks [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  out, he lines up behind Trump and immediately resumes his position as valet, walks out right [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=408.96s)]
*  behind him. He came to this proceeding in Trump's motorcade. He is going to go back and continue to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=415.11999999999995s)]
*  work for Donald Trump. His lawyers are paid for, at least to the extent he has lawyers, by Donald [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=421.2s)]
*  Trump's PAC. How in the world can you enforce an order that they can't talk? He literally is his [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=426.0s)]
*  subordinate, his employee, and almost sort of, it's almost he's his man Friday. How does he not [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=432.08s)]
*  talk to him and how does he not intimidate Waltine Nauta? Well great question. Number one, Joy, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=441.2s)]
*  as you're alluding to, there is a dual role or potential conflict in this individual being a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=446.56s)]
*  defendant on a co-conspiracy and still being the employee and having other services legal and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=453.52s)]
*  otherwise paid for by Donald Trump. Now that's not illegal, but it is what we would call attention [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=459.76s)]
*  there. And then second, how do you enforce an order like this? The short answer is it's hard, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=464.24s)]
*  but let's not forget what Jack Smith got ahold of. He got ahold of lawyer notes and other materials [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=469.84s)]
*  that Donald Trump thought would long remain secret because of the lengths they went. So while I agree [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  with what I think is the premise of your question, which is this is going to be hard to enforce, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=481.84s)]
*  if they talk about it in ways that other people here or the lawyers here or are again involved in [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=485.28s)]
*  ongoing crimes and violating this order and or trying to plot to suborn perjury etc. would be a [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=491.28s)]
*  new crime. Yeah. And anyone gets wind of that? Yes, that could become a note, which could become a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  tape or an evidence item that is used against them. Seems like something that would be hard to discern [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=501.28s)]
*  if they broke that rule, but if they did it would be so high consequence for them that there has to [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=506.71999999999997s)]
*  be some deterrent fact given that it would be immediately in front of a judge. Yes, although I [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=511.36s)]
*  don't know what deters Donald Trump. I mean, that's sort of never been a federal criminal [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=515.84s)]
*  defendant before. Yeah, that's true. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=521.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRMZKeYfjo&t=541.36s)]
