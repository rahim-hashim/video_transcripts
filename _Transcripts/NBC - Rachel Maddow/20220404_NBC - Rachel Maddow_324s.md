# Horrors In Ukraine Spark Push For War Crimes Charges For Russia
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc)
*  Joining me now is Ona Hathaway, Professor of International Law at Yale Law School [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=0.0s)]
*  and the founder and director of the Center for Global Legal Challenges. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=3.92s)]
*  Professor Hathaway, thank you for being with us. Is there any way to actually charge Vladimir [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=8.16s)]
*  Putin or anyone else in the Russian chain of command with war crimes? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=14.72s)]
*  Yes, probably the main way forward here at the moment is through the International Criminal Court. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=20.32s)]
*  As you mentioned, the International Criminal Court does have jurisdiction here, and that is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=26.56s)]
*  because Ukraine gave it jurisdiction starting in 2013 over all the events that are happening [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=33.36s)]
*  in Ukraine, and it still has jurisdiction today. In fact, the prosecutor of the International [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=39.2s)]
*  Criminal Court has already begun investigations supported by referrals from 41 countries who have [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  basically said, we really support this effort, many of them offering additional money and support [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=49.84s)]
*  and assistance for that investigation. So those investigations have already begun, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  and there's a number of steps here. There has to be evidence collection that is actually documenting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  the crimes that are taking place and ensuring that we collect that evidence in a way that it [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=66.16s)]
*  can eventually be presented in a court. And then there's the next step of figuring out who is [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=70.56s)]
*  responsible for these terrible crimes and connecting the acts and the terrible events to the people who [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=76.08s)]
*  actually are responsible for them. Let's talk about the facets that you talk about of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=82.48s)]
*  international law. Is it possible to create a tribunal about this that Russia isn't part of? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=90.08s)]
*  Russia doesn't have buy-in to the International Criminal Court, and this isn't the week or the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=97.76s)]
*  month or the year that it's going to decide to change its mind. So is there an enforcement [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=101.28s)]
*  mechanism? Yeah, so that's a great question. And the reason that the International Criminal Court [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=105.68s)]
*  does have jurisdiction over Russians is because they're committing their crimes in Ukraine. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=112.16s)]
*  So it's the same principle that if I go to London and I commit a crime there, I can be brought in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=117.44s)]
*  front of a London court for committing a crime in London. I'm an American, but I'm still responsible [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=123.12s)]
*  for the crimes that I commit in another state's territory. Similarly here, Russia is committing [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=128.64s)]
*  a whole host of crimes, war crimes, crimes against humanity, perhaps even genocide, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=134.96s)]
*  and the crime of aggression on the territory of Ukraine. So Ukraine does have the right to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=140.0s)]
*  prosecute those crimes to do it itself or to allow an international court to prosecute those [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=146.56s)]
*  crimes. And so Ukraine is given jurisdiction over these crimes to the International Criminal Court, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  and that's what allows it to have jurisdiction over the Russians who are committing their crimes [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=159.6s)]
*  on the soil of Ukraine. And so even though Russia is not party to the ICC, may not recognize it, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=164.88s)]
*  it doesn't really matter. It's still the case that the International Criminal Court can prosecute them [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  for the crimes that they're committing in Ukraine, because Ukraine is the one who has the power to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=175.68s)]
*  give the court jurisdiction. It is important to note that Joe Biden and the State Department and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=180.96s)]
*  others are talking about the fact that there are likely war crimes committed, because for decades, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=188.8s)]
*  the United States itself has either resisted or undermined institutions like the ICC or the UN High [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=193.2s)]
*  Commissioner on Human Rights because of allegations that have been made against the United States [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  and allies like Israel. Apparently the Biden administration is reviewing the US's position [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=205.2s)]
*  with respect to the International Criminal Court. This feels like a moment for America to re-engage [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=210.88s)]
*  those institutions. Absolutely. And you're absolutely right that the United States has had [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=216.88s)]
*  an uneasy relationship with the International Criminal Court in particular. You may remember [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  that under the Trump administration, that we actually sanctioned members of the International [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=228.88s)]
*  Criminal Court, judges and attorneys who were participating in an investigation of the United [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=234.56s)]
*  States for actions committed in Afghanistan. So we've had a very uneasy relationship with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=240.32s)]
*  the International Criminal Court. And what this moment does present is an opportunity for the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=246.4s)]
*  United States to think about how do we provide accountability in these situations? How can we [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  work with the International Criminal Court? Sometimes it is the only body that is legitimately [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=256.96s)]
*  in a position to actually prosecute these crimes. And we believe in international law. We believe [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=262.48s)]
*  in the Geneva Conventions. And we need a way to bring accountability for these violations. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=268.32s)]
*  And the International Criminal Court is really the institution that is best situated to do that, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=273.36s)]
*  in addition to the Ukrainian courts themselves, which as you mentioned in the outset of the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=278.64s)]
*  segment has already begun some investigations. In fact, thousands of cases of war crimes violations. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=284.72s)]
*  But aside from the Ukrainian courts, the International Criminal Court really is the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=291.2s)]
*  best institution for taking these forward. And so the US is going to have to figure out how [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=295.2s)]
*  to work with it effectively and how to support its efforts. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUltNH2Hnc&t=300.24s)]
