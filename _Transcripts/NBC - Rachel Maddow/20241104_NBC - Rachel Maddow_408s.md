Video Description: Rachel Maddow notes that pro-Trump, right-wing groups are making threats again around the 2024 election in support of Donald Trump. But at every level of Trump's 2020 insurrection, his foot soldiers are the ones who paid the price, with criminal prosecutions of January 6 rioters, and coup plotters, and fake electors, and even lawyers, many of whom were disbarred. So will those prosecutions and the promise of more be enough to deter further pro-Trump violence?

# Maddow: Despite right-wing threats, pro-Trump election violence less likely after prosecutions
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg)
*  Let's also talk about crime in this election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=0.0s)]
*  Everybody's talking about the polls, I know. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=4.0s)]

*  There's a ton of these headlines about right-wing pro-Trump groups planning to sow chaos around [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  polling sites in the election. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=19.72s)]
*  Right-wing pro-Trump groups forming an army to try to stop the counting of votes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=22.28s)]
*  Paramilitary pro-Trump groups planning to menace people. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=27.04s)]
*  Pro-Trump groups planning violence around the election. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=30.88s)]
*  Bringing back all the things they tried to do in 2020 to overthrow that election, up [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=33.68s)]
*  to and including the violence they tried on January 6th in Washington to stop the certification [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=37.72s)]
*  of the vote. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=42.32s)]
*  You've seen all these headlines about how it's all coming back, they're going to try [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=43.32s)]
*  it all again. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  You know what all of that is? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=48.0s)]
*  All of that is crime. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=50.68s)]
*  Violence of any kind for any reason is a crime. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=55.24s)]
*  Intimidating election workers or public officials or voters is a crime. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  Paramilitary militias are themselves a crime. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  The leader of the Proud Boys is serving 22 years in federal prison right now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=67.6s)]
*  I mean, even the fake electors thing, impersonating electors, that whole fake electors scheme [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=71.92s)]
*  was a crime. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  It was a crime in 2020 and just because you're thinking about trying it a second time doesn't [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=78.9s)]
*  make it any more legal than it was back then. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=83.36s)]
*  Law enforcement didn't know what these pro-Trump groups were going to try to do in 2020. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=86.56s)]
*  Law enforcement didn't know what these guys were going to do in 2020 any more than the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=92.72s)]
*  pro-Trump groups did. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=95.32s)]
*  They sort of felt their way through it and just crammed along the way as they made stuff [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=97.08s)]
*  up. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=100.52s)]
*  But now law enforcement knows what these pro-Trump groups and the Trump campaign are going to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=101.8s)]
*  do. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=106.8s)]
*  And if these guys are planning the exact same set of crimes in 2024, they're just planning [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=108.0s)]
*  on doing more of them in more places, this stuff doesn't get any less illegal. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=113.72s)]
*  It just means there's going to be more arrests. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  Tonight in Philadelphia, the district attorney there just gave a news conference reminding [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=123.68s)]
*  anybody who's excited about committing crimes tomorrow to try to mess with the election. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=127.28s)]
*  He gave a press conference reminding that those crimes will be treated as crimes just [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=133.16s)]
*  because you're thinking about doing your crimes for Donald Trump doesn't mean they're not [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=136.98s)]
*  crimes and that you won't be going to prison for committing them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=140.18s)]
*  Watch this from the Philly DA. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=144.94s)]
*  I mean, inject this straight into my veins, honestly, but also please just just watch [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=146.34s)]
*  this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=151.18s)]
*  I want people to be reassured that when they get up tomorrow to go vote, if they have not [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=153.54s)]
*  voted already, that everybody in this city is working and has been working for months [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=158.1s)]
*  to make sure that there will be nothing tough about that experience and nothing to fear [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=163.72s)]
*  in that experience. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=169.0s)]
*  But I also want to be clear, anybody who thinks it's time to play militia, F around and find [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=177.72s)]
*  Anybody who thinks it's time to insult, to deride, to mistreat, to threaten people, F [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  around and find out. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=188.11999999999998s)]
*  We do have the cuffs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  We do have the jail cells. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  We do have the Philly juries and we have the state prisons. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=192.8s)]
*  So if you're going to try to turn an election into some form of coercion, if you're going [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=196.84s)]
*  to try to bully people, bully votes or voters, you're going to try to erase votes, you're [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=203.12s)]
*  going to try any of that nonsense, we're not playing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=207.64s)]
*  F around and find out. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  Pennsylvania officials also circulating the hotline. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=215.64s)]
*  You can call to report voter intimidation in that state. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=218.92s)]
*  F around and find out we're not playing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  That applies to anybody who wants to commit crimes, targeting voters or polling sites [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=224.28s)]
*  or anything else about our election. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=231.32s)]
*  It doesn't just hold in Philly. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=232.32s)]
*  It holds everywhere. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=233.32s)]
*  I would just say one last point here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=235.48s)]
*  It also applies to anybody thinking about trying to paper over those crimes to try to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=237.68s)]
*  give them an air of legality. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=241.56s)]
*  I mean, there is a reason why Rudy Giuliani is not only under indictment right now, he [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=243.0s)]
*  also no longer owns any of his worldly possessions because Rudy Giuliani used his position as [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=247.96s)]
*  Donald Trump's lawyer to come after innocent poll workers in Georgia who have now literally [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  sued him out of his house and home. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=260.2s)]
*  Just a few days ago, Thursday, Halloween, the lawyer who quarterbacked the fake electors [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=263.68s)]
*  scheme for Donald Trump was indefinitely barred from ever practicing law in New York State [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=268.2s)]
*  again. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=273.76s)]
*  I mean, while they are taking away the law license of the guy who organized the fake [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=275.56s)]
*  electors last time, which got all the fake electors arrested, here's politico.com reporting [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=278.92s)]
*  today that Republicans are nevertheless bringing all the fake electors back again to try it [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=284.36s)]
*  one more time. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=288.88s)]
*  Whereupon let me let you know, it is still illegal and you're all going to get arrested [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=290.28s)]
*  again. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=296.03999999999996s)]
*  As the Philly DA said, F around and find out nobody's playing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=297.32s)]
*  Trump fake electors guy, Kenneth Chesbrough, was indicted and pled guilty to a felony and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=303.72s)]
*  has now had his law license suspended. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=308.16s)]
*  Trump lawyer, Jenna Ellis, was indicted and pled guilty and had her law license suspended. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=310.48s)]
*  Trump lawyer, John Eastman, has been indicted and had his law license suspended. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=315.32s)]
*  Trump lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has been indicted, has been permanently disbarred and has been [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=319.6s)]
*  irrevocably and profoundly bankrupted for life. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=324.04s)]
*  And that is just what happened to the lawyers. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=328.2s)]
*  Messing with an election in the United States of America is a crime. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=333.52s)]
*  This election, there is a lot to pay attention to. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=341.52s)]
*  So pace yourself. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=344.8s)]
*  People are going to try to rerun 2020 and interfere in the election, try to use violence [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=346.8s)]
*  to get their way. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=351.24s)]
*  They are going to get arrested and they are going to go to prison. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=352.8s)]
*  And we are going to have that crime story to deal with if they try it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=355.8s)]
*  We are also going to have a big national security mess to clean up just from the Trump campaign, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=360.24s)]
*  even if Harris wins. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=365.12s)]
*  There's so much we're going to need to stand up for and be ready for, and it does not stop [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  tomorrow no matter what happens tomorrow. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=372.12s)]
*  So my friends, deep breaths. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=376.36s)]
*  Hydrate. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=380.44s)]
*  Beer back in the fridge, wine back on the shelf. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=381.44s)]
*  We have lots of work to do. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=383.28s)]
*  Tomorrow is just the start. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=386.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yk9tQSv2BCg&t=389.56s)]
