# Federal Investigators Focused On Rash Of Threats Against Historically Black Schools
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg)
*  As President Wilson was just describing, there are more than 20 historically black colleges [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=0.0s)]
*  and universities now having received these threats in less than a month, including more than a dozen [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=4.16s)]
*  today. Joining us now is Congresswoman Alma Adams. She is founder and co-chair of the HBCU caucus [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=8.4s)]
*  in Congress. Congresswoman Adams, I really appreciate you being here. Thank you for being here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=14.64s)]
*  And thank you, Rachel, for having me today, the first day of Black History Month, when we should [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=19.28s)]
*  be celebrating and not dealing with these kinds of things. I listened to the president [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=25.12s)]
*  talk about the threat on his campus, but when we look at the threats across this country, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  they are acts of terror, hate crimes, and yes, indeed, they must be fully investigated and [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=36.72s)]
*  prosecuted. And clearly, that's what we have asked to have done. I'm a product of an HBCU. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=42.8s)]
*  I talked 40 years on a campus. I have a grandson, that Howard. I talked to him today as well. So, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=49.84s)]
*  we're very concerned. These threats are really concerning to all of us. And so our federal and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=56.64s)]
*  our state law enforcement agencies must get involved. I believe they will. We certainly [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=62.88s)]
*  have had some conversations through my office with them as well. We're going to continue [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=67.68s)]
*  to follow this. And every person involved, whether it's one, two, three, or four or more, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=72.16s)]
*  should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=78.24s)]
*  You noted in your statement today, Congresswoman, about the adversity that is such a striking part [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=82.32s)]
*  of so many individual HBCUs in their history, the things that these campuses have gone through, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=88.88s)]
*  the things that their student bodies have been up against, the way they have been [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=94.0s)]
*  individually targeted in some states and in some places over their long histories. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Have you ever seen what appears to be a coordinated effort terrorizing them all, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=102.64s)]
*  targeting so many historically black institutions all at once? I feel like I've covered a lot of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=110.4s)]
*  news stories and a lot of political stories about students being disenfranchised and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  campuses being targeted and there being discrimination efforts. But something like this, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=121.68s)]
*  affecting such a big swath of these organizations all at once, this is unfamiliar territory. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, it's unfamiliar to me, too. Like I said, I spent 40 years on the campus, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=131.92s)]
*  I'm very involved as part of the bipartisan HBCU caucus with our students and with the CDC. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=139.2s)]
*  So, no, we've not seen this. And it's a major disruption in terms of the flow of scholarship [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  and education and getting the class and all those kinds of things. And the students are afraid, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  and they should be. And they need to be careful, they need to be diligent. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=158.72s)]
*  If you see something, say something, even if you don't think it's much. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=163.6s)]
*  But in spite of all of the external threats, our schools are resilient institutions and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  they will persist through all forms of adversity. And they have. And I certainly appreciate Speaker [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  Pelosi and Chairwoman Bass and everyone else, and my colleagues will be joining with us to speak out [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=178.32s)]
*  against these despicable acts. Congresswoman Alma Adams, one last question for you here, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=185.28s)]
*  and that is about the federal response that I was just describing. We just heard from the president [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=193.04s)]
*  of Morgan State that there have been contacts with the FBI, there have been contacts with Homeland [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=198.64s)]
*  Security. Clearly, there's a federal government response here. We heard from the White House [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=202.8s)]
*  press secretary today that President Biden has been briefed on the threats and is aware of this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=206.48s)]
*  Is there anything else that you think needs to be done in terms of the federal government [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=211.12s)]
*  response, or do you feel like the administration is taking this seriously and putting the right [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  kind of resources on trying to find out what happened here and trying to put a stop to this? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think the administration is doing an excellent job of doing that and keeping us [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=222.4s)]
*  informed. I think we're going to have to all work together. Of course, we're writing letters and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=228.64s)]
*  putting out petitions and trying to make sure that we stay in touch with these chancellors and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=234.64s)]
*  presidents and our students so that we can find out what's going on, who's doing it, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=241.52s)]
*  because terrorism and racism have no place on college campuses. Education is a powerful thing, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  and our students need to be educated, and their education doesn't need to be disrupted in this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=256.24s)]
*  way. And that's exactly what's happening right now. So we're doing what I think we need to do. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=261.52s)]
*  We're all pulling together and being a support to make sure we get getting into this. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=266.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Elma Adams is the founder and co-chair of the HBCU caucus in Congress. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for your time tonight. I am sorry that this is happening. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=279.52s)]
*  I'm glad to hear you feel like that. I'm glad to hear that you feel the resources are in the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=283.28s)]
*  right place and going in the right directions. Let's hope for arrests soon. Thank you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=287.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=291.44s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you, Rachel. Thank you for having me. Have a good night. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w_22wWYhzg&t=292.64s)]
