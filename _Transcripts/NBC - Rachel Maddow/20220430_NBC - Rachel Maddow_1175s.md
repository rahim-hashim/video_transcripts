# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 29
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig)
*  Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=0.0s)]
*  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be looking at me in a year, in a year or two years. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=6.8s)]
*  Let's give me a little bit of time to run things. But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=11.76s)]
*  I remember that interview. He said he was going to do it and he did a great job. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=17.52s)]
*  That was then candidate Donald Trump praising the right wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=22.88s)]
*  in an interview on Jones's Infowars show as a presidential candidate back in 2015. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=28.4s)]
*  At the time, Alex Jones was three years into his vile attacks on the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=33.92s)]
*  elementary school shooting, where 26 people, including 20 kids, were shot dead in their [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=39.68s)]
*  classrooms. And he was getting rich doing it. Trump didn't care. Over the next three years, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=45.44s)]
*  Alex Jones's online store would rake in more than $50 million annually, selling body armor and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=50.32s)]
*  dietary supplements. And his website saw an average of 1.4 million visits daily. That interview [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=55.84s)]
*  was one of candidate Donald Trump's earliest experiments in normalizing and promoting dangerous [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=62.24s)]
*  far-right conspiracy theorists. It served as a dark warning sign of where American politics [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=67.84s)]
*  would eventually and quickly end up. One of our two political parties has been so willing to condone [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=72.48s)]
*  and tolerate fringe conspiracy theories that Trump's followers attempted a coup against the seat of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=77.92s)]
*  American government, a fact conveniently and regularly forgotten or excused by the party's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=83.28s)]
*  leaders. But that moment is also a reminder that even the most influential conspiracy theorists [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=88.08s)]
*  can be beaten. Nearly seven years later, Donald Trump is still the de facto leader of the Republican [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=92.8s)]
*  Party. But Alex Jones is on the brink of ruin thanks to a series of defamation lawsuits brought [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=97.92s)]
*  by the families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting. Thanks to that, Alex Jones now finds [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=103.12s)]
*  himself liable for millions of dollars in damages. His companies are now trying to declare bankruptcy [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=108.48s)]
*  in a desperate attempt to prevent the fortune he made pushing lies and diet supplements from being [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=113.84s)]
*  seized. In a hearing today in a Texas bankruptcy court, Jones's lawyers made references to free [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=119.44s)]
*  speech, to deplatforming, and even to Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter to try and paint Jones and his [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=124.56s)]
*  businesses as victims of the so-called woke mob. None of that seems to have helped him. The judge [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=130.4s)]
*  overseeing the case said he could make a decision on Alex Jones's bankruptcy ploy as soon as next [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=136.0s)]
*  month. But perhaps there's no better example of just how far Alex Jones has fallen than the fact [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  that he is now begging for help from the dreaded deep state he spent so many years railing against. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=145.76s)]
*  Last week, Jones formally reached out to the Justice Department to try and get an immunity deal [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=151.44s)]
*  in exchange for cooperating with the department's investigation into January the 6th. Jones was in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  D.C. on the 6th. Two people familiar with the matter told New York Times reporter Elizabeth [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=160.88s)]
*  Williamson this week that such an immunity deal is unlikely to materialize, leaving Alex Jones out [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=165.28s)]
*  in the cold. No one, not the Justice Department, the bankruptcy courts, or even the former president, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=171.44s)]
*  appear eager to hand him a lifeline. So what does that mean for Alex Jones? And is his case a model [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=176.8s)]
*  for how to push back against the peddlers of disinformation in the present age? Joining me [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=182.08s)]
*  now is New York Times reporter Elizabeth Williamson, who has been covering Alex Jones's legal [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=187.44s)]
*  troubles. She's also author of the recent book Sandy Hook, An American Tragedy and the Battle [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=192.4s)]
*  for Truth. Thanks so much for joining us tonight. Walk me through what Alex Jones's situation is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=196.88s)]
*  here and how much money he might potentially have to pay out to these Sandy Hook families in the end. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  Sure, Maddie. So I think what's happening here is, you know, the bankruptcy idea is a way to avoid [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=208.88s)]
*  the jury trial. So late last year, Alex Jones was found liable in four separate defamation [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=216.0s)]
*  suits filed by the Sandy Hook families. That was because he so obstructed the discovery process [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=223.04s)]
*  in the run-up to trial that the judges found him liable by default. So that means that this year, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=228.72s)]
*  and it was supposed to begin this week, juries would meet to decide how much he must pay the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  Sandy Hook families in damages. The bankruptcy filing was filed exactly one week before those [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=241.76s)]
*  trials were seen by the Justice Department's bankruptcy court overseer and the Sandy Hook [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  family's lawyers as a ploy to delay these jury trials for damages, which, as you point out, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  could correctly cost him millions of dollars and potentially his business. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=263.28s)]
*  And the other part of this puzzle, of course, the whole DOJ angle. What should we make of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=268.32s)]
*  Jones's attempts to cooperate with the Biden Justice Department? Does he think that will help [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=272.48s)]
*  him with his bankruptcy case? Does he implicitly accept he has some liability when it comes to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=276.64s)]
*  January the 6th? I think these are two separate issues which have one thing in common, and that's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=280.88s)]
*  that he is seeking protection from the government, which he maligns daily on his show. I think he [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=287.92s)]
*  sees himself as under threat. And in the Justice Department investigation into the January 6th [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=294.08s)]
*  insurrection, he has been subpoenaed by the House, and he's reached out to offer a deal for immunity [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  from prosecution to justice in exchange for his testimony. This probably isn't going to fly, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=308.8s)]
*  partly because he may not know much. So that's one issue. And then the separate is, as we discussed, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=315.76s)]
*  the bankruptcy case in which he's seeking protection from a federal bankruptcy court [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=321.84s)]
*  for his business. It's a very unusual bankruptcy filing in that Alex Jones himself hasn't filed [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=329.28s)]
*  for bankruptcy, just these sort of shell companies. It's an effort to ask the, or sort of force the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  Sandy Hook families into a $10 million settlement, which is saying that he doesn't have the finances [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=344.08s)]
*  to do anything further. But this is someone who's made a half billion dollars in revenues from the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=352.23999999999995s)]
*  time of the Sandy Hook shooting to the president. Wow. And last quick question on that, he's made [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=358.08s)]
*  a lot of money, he has a big reach. Donald Trump went on his show, Matt Gaetz went on his show, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=363.52s)]
*  Jones got White House credentials at one point, press credentials during the Trump era. He was [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  mainstreamed and normalized, this hate monger, this purveyor of anti-Semitism, this bully of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=374.0s)]
*  families by top people in the Republican Party, wasn't he? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=379.2s)]
*  Yes. And the issue there is that there is a segment of Alex Jones's audience [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=383.76s)]
*  that was a very valuable constituency for former President Trump. That is the group of people, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  conspiracy minded, but deeply distrustful of the government, who put him over the top in the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=398.32s)]
*  presidential election in 2016. Yes, they did. New York Times writer Elizabeth Williams. And [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=404.24s)]
*  thank you so much for your time and your analysis tonight. Appreciate it. Sure thing, Mehdi. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  When Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, he hired as his campaign chairman, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  this guy, Paul Manafort. It will never not be an absolutely crazy thing that our last president [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=420.88s)]
*  chose as his campaign chair, a guy who had spent the past many years in Ukraine, working for a [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=427.12s)]
*  pro-Putin political party and helping install a Kremlin friendly autocrat as Ukraine's president. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=432.32s)]
*  The reason Paul Manafort was available to run Donald Trump's campaign was that the people of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=438.32s)]
*  Ukraine had finally risen up in revolution and that pro-Putin autocrat Manafort's boss had fled [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=443.04s)]
*  to Russia. That democratic revolution in Ukraine sparked Vladimir Putin's invasion and annexation [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=448.64s)]
*  of Crimea and everything that came after. We are all still living through the historical consequences [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  of Paul Manafort's Ukraine misadventures. But what Manafort got out of those years working [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=459.44s)]
*  for the pro-Putin political party in Ukraine was money, lots and lots of money. And in 2018, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=464.48s)]
*  Manafort was convicted of using secret foreign accounts to hide the tens of millions of dollars [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=471.12s)]
*  he made. He also pled guilty to money laundering and obstruction. He served two years of a seven [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=476.48s)]
*  and a half year prison sentence, but then he was pardoned by President Trump just before he left [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=482.4s)]
*  office. Of course he was. And he even got back a bunch of the real estate he'd had to forfeit as [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=487.28s)]
*  part of his conviction. Real estate he'd bought with those ill-gotten gains. He recently sold [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=492.08s)]
*  his Hamptons mansion for more than 10 million dollars. Not a bad deal. But here is a plot twist [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=497.67999999999995s)]
*  we did not see coming. You may recall that when Manafort was convicted on eight felony counts back [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=504.23999999999995s)]
*  in 2018, there were another 10 charges on which the jury could not reach a verdict. The judge in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  the case declared a mistrial on those 10 counts. Well, the Justice Department appears to have [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=514.64s)]
*  decided that those counts are not covered by Trump's pardon. That Trump pardon applies only to the stuff [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  Manafort was convicted for or pled guilty to. Because yesterday the Justice Department filed [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=525.12s)]
*  a brand new civil suit against Paul Manafort over some of those secret foreign bank accounts [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=530.72s)]
*  where he hid his millions from all his work in Ukraine. Accounts for which he was never convicted. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=535.92s)]
*  The Justice Department says Manafort owes the US government almost three million dollars [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=542.08s)]
*  in penalties for hiding those accounts. Penalties the government has been trying to collect from [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=546.1600000000001s)]
*  Manafort for the last two years. And now they are asking a court to make him pay up. Trump's pardon [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=550.48s)]
*  looked like it put an end to Manafort's accountability for hiding all that money he made doing pro-Putin [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=556.72s)]
*  dirty work in Ukraine. Now it looks like the US justice system might not quite be finished with [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=561.84s)]
*  Paul Manafort. Remember all of that talk from Republicans about voter fraud in the 2020 election [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=568.48s)]
*  or the hysterical warnings about election tampering? Well it appears they were right. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=575.6800000000001s)]
*  This is a picture of Dallas Schroeder, the top elections official in Elbert County, Colorado. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=581.6s)]
*  According to a new Reuters report, it was taken from a surveillance video where he was seen copying [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=586.08s)]
*  computer drives containing sensitive voting information. That report states that Schroeder [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=590.8000000000001s)]
*  later testified that he not only made copies of that highly sensitive data but he then gave it to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=595.76s)]
*  two lawyers. But don't worry, he says he took great care in what he was doing. Quote, Schroeder said [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=600.8s)]
*  that he was careful to preserve chain of custody with the data he gave the attorneys, asserting [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=606.08s)]
*  that the copied hard drives remained in sealed containers. Mr. Schroeder is now under investigation [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=610.64s)]
*  for possibly breaking election laws and is being sued by the state of Colorado for not returning [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=616.24s)]
*  that data. So yes, Republicans were right to be worried about election tampering. Only this guy [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=621.2s)]
*  was a Republican himself. When those cameras caught him copying those computer drives, he was [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=628.48s)]
*  reportedly getting instructions from a political activist who was trying to prove that Trump won [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=633.84s)]
*  the election. Trump didn't win the election. And the reason we know all this, the reason we know [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=638.4000000000001s)]
*  about any of this, is because Mr. Schroeder copped to the scheme in a pretty remarkable way. As Reuters [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=643.2800000000001s)]
*  reports, Schroeder admitted to copying the hard drives in a lawsuit he joined with other Republican [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=649.2s)]
*  officials against Colorado's Secretary of State. He wasn't exactly hiding what he was up to. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  Apparently this was just one of eight attempts to gain unauthorized access to voting systems in [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=659.0400000000001s)]
*  America that Reuters has uncovered since the 2020 election. And wait for it, each one involved local [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=664.48s)]
*  Republican officials or activists taking the big lie and wrecking havoc with it. This story is yet [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=671.44s)]
*  another reminder that while we talk about politics on a very national level, Trump's conspiracies [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=678.08s)]
*  about the 2020 election have already filtered all the way down to the most local of levels. It's [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=682.8000000000001s)]
*  permeated every level of Republican discourse, right down to ordinary folks in districts all [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=688.08s)]
*  around the country who believe this stuff. Joining us now is Nathan Lane, a journalist for Reuters, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=693.44s)]
*  and one of the bylines on that reporting. Thank you so much for being here. We laid out the case [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=699.6s)]
*  of Mr. Schroeder, but can you highlight some of the other instances in which Republican office [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=704.8s)]
*  holders or party activists tried to gain access to voting systems? Sure, sure. Yes, my colleague [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=709.52s)]
*  Alexander Ulmer was dug deep into the Schroeder case there in Colorado. I took a close look at [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=717.92s)]
*  several cases in Michigan, a crazy case in Cross-Village Township where a Republican, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=724.9599999999999s)]
*  presumed Trump supporter, basically convinced three men that he was working for the government, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  working for Sidney Powell, and convinced them to head to the local government office and start [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  tampering with the vote tabulator there. In another case in Michigan, Adams Township, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=747.44s)]
*  it was actually the clerk. The clerk, she's a Republican who was essentially refusing state [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=755.52s)]
*  orders to perform maintenance on the machine because she believed that it could erase evidence [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=762.72s)]
*  of fraud in the 2020 election. And when, since the county officials came to take possession of the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=769.36s)]
*  machine, she had taken a key component and kept it in her office. And so now that is being [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=777.2s)]
*  investigated as a criminal investigation. Wow. And there is a recurring theme, especially in [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=784.5600000000001s)]
*  your reporting of quote, preserving evidence, even as these people break election laws on camera [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=791.68s)]
*  or admit to doing so in legal filings. I know you're not a psychologist, you're a reporter, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=796.88s)]
*  but can you speak to the rationale behind these vigilante investigations and how they're able to [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=800.8s)]
*  persuade people to do them? Well, sure. I mean, it's exactly as you laid out previously. You know, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=805.92s)]
*  the rhetoric is there, the Trump and his allies continue to talk about how the election was [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=813.52s)]
*  rigged against him and his followers and his supporters believe that. So it's a leap, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=819.2s)]
*  but it's one that some people are willing to take to go from that rhetoric to action. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  And if you talk to people, especially in rural parts of these states that we looked at, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=832.08s)]
*  they believe it. You know, I've been alarmed and very surprised at the level of belief and how [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=838.1600000000001s)]
*  strongly they believe that the election was rigged. And what is remarkable is that in many [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=846.4s)]
*  cases, they're choosing to believe conspiracy theorists and election denialists over their own [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=851.76s)]
*  county officials. I talked about Adams Township. There's the clerk there, the county clerk who [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=860.88s)]
*  oversees the local clerks is a Republican and a very reputable clerk. And, you know, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=867.12s)]
*  she has been trying to guide that process, but they just don't, they're more willing to believe [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=875.68s)]
*  someone like Sidney Powell than they are their local officials. Yeah, I wonder what their media [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=881.12s)]
*  diet is like. I suspect a lot of these people are not listening to local officials because they're [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=888.8s)]
*  busy watching Fox Newsmax and OAN. And a quick last question. This guy Schroeder in Colorado, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=892.4s)]
*  I believe he's running for county commissioner despite being investigated for election tampering. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=897.6s)]
*  Is there a trend here or is he an outlier in terms of just not caring and running for more officers? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=902.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, you see that, that, you know, that a lot of the people that are sort of caught [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=908.72s)]
*  in these instances, they're not backing down. I did some reporting about, it was an attempted [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=915.76s)]
*  breach, but in North Carolina where a local Republican leader essentially was threatening [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=922.16s)]
*  the local elections official that if they didn't give, if she didn't give access to the voting [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=927.6s)]
*  equipment, he was going to get her fired. And we reported about that about a week ago. And he's [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=934.0799999999999s)]
*  since organized another event with an election denier. So there's really no backing down. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=941.52s)]
*  There isn't. And I would call these people shameless, but that requires them to have [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=952.3199999999999s)]
*  shame in the first place. Nathan Lane, reporter for Reuters. Thank you so much for your time [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=955.68s)]
*  tonight. And thank you for your reporting. Thank you. If you know a thing or two about Russia, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=959.68s)]
*  then you are familiar with headlines like these. This is from the Guardian a few years back. Quote, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=966.4s)]
*  did he jump or was he pushed? Russian journalists fear worst after another death. Or this one from [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=970.8s)]
*  two years ago, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in coma after suspected poisoning. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=976.0s)]
*  Here's a particularly blunt one. A trio of wealthy Russians made an enemy of Putin. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=981.44s)]
*  Now they're all dead. If you know anything about Russia, then you know that speaking out against [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=986.32s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has consequences. For that reason, even those closest to him, the economic elite, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=990.48s)]
*  the oligarchs are too afraid to speak out. But now with the illegal invasion of Ukraine and the epic [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=995.6800000000001s)]
*  economic sanctions imposed by the US and Europe on Russia, the tide may be turning. From the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1001.7600000000001s)]
*  Washington Post today, quote, cracks emerge in Russian elite as tycoons start to bemoan invasion. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1007.6s)]
*  In the two months since Russia invaded Ukraine, the silence and even acquiescence of the Russian [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1013.44s)]
*  elite has started to fray. And some of the tycoons, especially those who made their fortunes [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1018.16s)]
*  before President Vladimir Putin came to power, have begun tentatively to speak. In one day, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1022.8000000000001s)]
*  they destroyed what was built over many years. It's a catastrophe, said one businessman who was [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1028.32s)]
*  summoned along with many of the country's other richest men to meet Putin on the day of the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1033.2s)]
*  invasion. Another oligarch simply called the invasion of Ukraine, quote, insanity. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1037.2s)]
*  But let's be realistic. These guys are starting to speak out off the record because they're worried [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1042.32s)]
*  about their money. And while it's still a good thing that they are starting to talk, it's worth [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1047.76s)]
*  reminding everyone that Ukraine is losing much, much more. President Zelensky said today that at [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1052.16s)]
*  least 900 bodies have been discovered thus far in mass graves surrounding Ukraine's capital. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1058.16s)]
*  The mayor of Mariupol said that more than 600 people were injured after Russia bombed a makeshift [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  hospital inside the Azof-style steel plant where the last defenders of the city, along with [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1068.4s)]
*  hundreds of civilians, are hiding. What is taking place is unconscionable. This was the reaction [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1073.6000000000001s)]
*  today from Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby when asked whether or not Putin is a rational actor [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  given Russia's scorched earth invasion of Ukraine. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1084.96s)]
*  It's hard to look at what he's doing in Ukraine, what his forces are doing in Ukraine, and think [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1089.44s)]
*  that any ethical, moral individual could justify that. It's difficult to look at the [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1097.6000000000001s)]
*  images. Sorry. It's difficult to look at some of the images and imagine that any well-thinking [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1115.04s)]
*  serious, mature leader would do that. Mr. Kirby went on to say, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1124.72s)]
*  quote, I can't talk to his psychology, but I think we can all speak to his depravity. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1129.6000000000001s)]
*  To counter that depravity, the U.S. continues to ramp up aid. Today, nearly 20 flights of military [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1134.56s)]
*  aid arrived in Eastern Europe from the U.S. to be immediately transferred to Ukraine. It comes [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1139.8400000000001s)]
*  as President Biden has asked Congress to approve a whopping $33 billion package to supply Ukraine [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1144.56s)]
*  with military, economic, and humanitarian aid for the next five months. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI5m5Ne23ig&t=1150.48s)]
