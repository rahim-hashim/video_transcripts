*  After years of residents calling for the renaming of one of South Florida's most well-known [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxUiZWbnXU&t=0.0s)]
*  roads, the Dixie Highway in 2021 finally became the Harriet Tubman Highway instead. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxUiZWbnXU&t=5.44s)]
*  Well, as of today, you can take the Harriet Tubman Highway to get to another newly named [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxUiZWbnXU&t=13.0s)]
*  major road in Miami-Dade County. You can take it to Justice Katanji Brown Jackson Street. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxUiZWbnXU&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  The Supreme Court Justice today made her first appearance back in her home state since getting [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxUiZWbnXU&t=25.6s)]
*  sworn into the court. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxUiZWbnXU&t=28.74s)]
*  I hope that this street naming will also serve as a testament to what is possible in this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxUiZWbnXU&t=32.26s)]
*  great country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxUiZWbnXU&t=39.379999999999995s)]
*  That's today in Miami-Dade County, in Florida. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LxUiZWbnXU&t=42.739999999999995s)]
