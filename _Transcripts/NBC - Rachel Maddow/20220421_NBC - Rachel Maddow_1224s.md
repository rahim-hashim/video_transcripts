# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 20
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4)
*  In the great state of Tennessee, the 5th congressional district is right here in the central part of the state. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=0.0s)]
*  Fun fact about the 5th district is that it's the only district in the whole state that doesn't share a border with another state. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=5.8s)]
*  It's basically the landlocked Tennessee congressional district. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=12.3s)]
*  And it turns out there's a whole bunch of little tidbits about that district that are of interest to people who live there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=15.8s)]
*  There's enough of them that you could sort of make up a whole game show about it if you wanted to. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=21.6s)]
*  A local radio station in Nashville has done just that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=25.7s)]
*  It's called Taking the Fifth and the game show goes a little bit like this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=28.5s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=33.7s)]
*  What three interstate highways are located in the 5th congressional district? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=36.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm the terrible driver. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=40.0s)]
*  I don't know that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=43.2s)]
*  I don't drive anywhere that I go. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=44.3s)]
*  Okay, it's I-65, I-40 and I-24. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=46.7s)]
*  I don't drive anywhere that I go. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=49.5s)]
*  It's all hang gliding? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=52.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=56.5s)]
*  You know, if you don't like driving though, that might be a tricky question. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=57.5s)]
*  The interstates thing maybe. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=60.5s)]
*  The thing you need to know about this trivia game show though about the 5th congressional district in Tennessee is that they don't invite just random people from the district to play this game. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=63.5s)]
*  This radio station specifically invites people to play this game if they are running for Congress to represent this district. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=71.5s)]
*  That clip we just played was in fact a Republican candidate who was running in the Republican primary to try to fill an open congressional seat in the Tennessee 5th. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=79.5s)]
*  So she goes on this local radio show to show her would-be constituents how, you know, how she deserves to be their representative. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=87.5s)]
*  How one she is with the people of the 5th district. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=95.0s)]
*  And her first question that one about the three interstates in the district, that didn't go well. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=99.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was just the first question though. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=104.0s)]
*  Plenty of time for redemption. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=105.5s)]
*  A country music superstar, a famous multi Grammy award winning performer has a popular winery in the center of the 5th district in Arrington, Tennessee. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=109.0s)]
*  I have been to that winery. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=118.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=119.5s)]
*  Yes, it's great. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=120.5s)]
*  I love that winery. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=121.5s)]
*  I bought it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=122.5s)]
*  I bought like who owns it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=123.5s)]
*  Who owns it? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=125.5s)]
*  Oh, you got this though, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=126.5s)]
*  You've been to the winery. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=128.5s)]
*  You bought some of their wine. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=129.5s)]
*  I bought some wine. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=131.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=132.5s)]
*  So you got this one. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=134.5s)]
*  You've been there, right? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=136.5s)]
*  This one, Alicia is going to get this one, right? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=138.5s)]
*  It has to answer the question though. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=140.5s)]
*  It's great. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=144.5s)]
*  I love that winery. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=145.5s)]
*  I bought it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=146.5s)]
*  I bought like some wine. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=147.5s)]
*  I don't know who owns it, but I love it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=148.5s)]
*  We went there for the summer and had a picnic outside. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=150.5s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=152.5s)]
*  Kixbrooks. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=153.5s)]
*  So he's a he's a Tennessean. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=154.5s)]
*  Who owns the winery? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=157.5s)]
*  Oh, who owns it? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=158.5s)]
*  No idea. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=160.5s)]
*  Absolutely no idea. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=161.5s)]
*  Here's another one. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=162.5s)]
*  This is about that big giant car dealership in your district right in the center of the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=163.5s)]
*  district. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=168.5s)]
*  Huge. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=169.5s)]
*  You can't miss it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=170.5s)]
*  Everybody who lives there knows that one. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=171.5s)]
*  One of the most famous NASCAR drivers living today lives in the Fifth District, has a large [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=172.5s)]
*  auto dealership in Franklin. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=178.5s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=180.5s)]
*  You know, my husband is the car guy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=181.5s)]
*  He he knows all he used to race. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=183.5s)]
*  He knows all of the all of the racing stuff. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=185.5s)]
*  Darryl Waltrip. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=188.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=189.5s)]
*  This is a Tennessee one. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=190.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=191.5s)]
*  I think they all are. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=192.5s)]
*  From this much. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=193.5s)]
*  She's realizing in real time how bad this is going. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=194.5s)]
*  Oh, I think these are all Tennessee questions, Patrick. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=197.5s)]
*  So this is going very poorly for me. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=202.5s)]
*  But there's there's one more. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=205.5s)]
*  This is the last one from the very end of the game. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=206.5s)]
*  Rather well-known Confederate general, one whose name and history have been a source of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=210.5s)]
*  enormous controversy in Tennessee the last few years was born and raised in the community [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=214.5s)]
*  of Chapel Hill in the Fifth District. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=219.5s)]
*  Who was he? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=221.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=222.5s)]
*  Nathan Bedford Forrest. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=224.5s)]
*  What county is Chapel Hill in? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=225.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=227.5s)]
*  Marshall County. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=228.5s)]
*  It's in your district. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=229.5s)]
*  So that did not go well for that candidate. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=232.5s)]
*  Her name is Morgan Ortegas. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=235.5s)]
*  And, you know, it's a remarkable thing to see this just kind of a disillusion, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=238.5s)]
*  A candidate for public office not being able to name the counties in her district. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=243.5s)]
*  But it's another thing entirely when that candidate was handpicked to run for that seat [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=248.5s)]
*  by the de facto head of the Republican Party. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=252.5s)]
*  Morgan Ortegas used to work in the Trump administration. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=255.5s)]
*  She's been personally endorsed for that seat by Donald Trump. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=258.5s)]
*  He was in such a rush to endorse her. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=261.5s)]
*  He actually did so before she had the chance to officially announce she was running for it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=263.5s)]
*  This is a race that's incredibly important to Republicans. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=267.5s)]
*  It's a seat currently held by a Democrat who's retiring. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=270.5s)]
*  So the Republicans have a reasonable chance to pick it up. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=272.5s)]
*  It's a crowded field. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=275.5s)]
*  There's like a dozen Republicans running in the primary. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=276.5s)]
*  You would think that being handpicked by the former president, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=279.5s)]
*  that would be like a golden ticket to the top of the field. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=282.5s)]
*  Except Morgan Ortegas has no idea what she's doing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=285.5s)]
*  She's not from Tennessee. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=290.5s)]
*  She only moved to the state last year, perhaps evidenced by that disastrous local radio appearance. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=292.5s)]
*  She doesn't even live in the district she is running to represent. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=298.5s)]
*  And so this has set up an interesting thing because this is not actually just a story about her. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=302.5s)]
*  It's a story about Donald Trump and his influence in the Republican Party. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=306.5s)]
*  Because the surprise twist in this story is that Republicans in the Tennessee legislature decided [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=309.5s)]
*  that Trump endorsement or not, they were not going to have her as the Republican candidate for that seat. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=314.5s)]
*  The Republican-led Tennessee legislature decided to pass a bill [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=320.5s)]
*  that requires anybody running for Congress in Tennessee [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=324.5s)]
*  to have lived in their district for at least three years before they run. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=327.5s)]
*  That seemed squarely aimed at booting Morgan Ortegas off the ticket for that seat. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=332.5s)]
*  Then arose another problem. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=338.5s)]
*  The Tennessee secretary of state said that new bill wouldn't actually apply to Ms. Ortegas [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=340.5s)]
*  because it was passed after the filing deadline. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=345.5s)]
*  But then Republicans in the Tennessee legislature decided they were going to kick her out of the race anyway. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=349.5s)]
*  They instead just voted to remove her name off the ballot. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=355.5s)]
*  Donald Trump's hand-picked candidate, they just took her off the ballot, full stop. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=359.5s)]
*  Now it's unclear whether it's going to actually work [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=363.5s)]
*  and whether Morgan Ortegas might challenge her removal from the ballot in court. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=367.5s)]
*  But either way, this is a twist, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=371.5s)]
*  This is an interesting and surprising time in Republican politics right now. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=375.5s)]
*  I mean, Trump not getting his way in the Republican Party, particularly in the South, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=379.5s)]
*  that's news. Him getting popped in the nose by the Republican Party like this, this is definitely news. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=383.5s)]
*  Back in February, just a week before Putin started his war against Ukraine, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=391.5s)]
*  the president of Brazil, the very Trumpy president of Brazil, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=396.5s)]
*  flew to Russia, spent three days in Moscow, and obviously met with Putin. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=401.5s)]
*  After his Putin meetings on that trip, the president of Brazil made some headlines [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=408.5s)]
*  for saying that his country, Brazil, was, quote, in solidarity with Russia. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=413.5s)]
*  Now, again, keep in mind the timing here. This was February this year. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=419.5s)]
*  This was a time when the whole world was on tenterhooks [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=423.5s)]
*  expecting that Putin was about to start a big war and invade Ukraine. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=426.5s)]
*  And there's Brazil's president hopping into Putin's proverbial lap, right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=430.5s)]
*  He goes to Moscow, does this big three-day official trip to Moscow, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=436.5s)]
*  has this big meeting, this big photo op with Putin. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=440.5s)]
*  He denied that Putin would launch any war in Ukraine. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=443.5s)]
*  For good measure, he explained how Brazil was closer than ever to Russia. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=447.5s)]
*  Don't worry, world, Putin's great. He's not going to do anything bad. He's my guy. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=451.5s)]
*  One week later, of course, Putin invaded Ukraine, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=457.5s)]
*  which was awkward for the Brazilian president. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=461.5s)]
*  But now today, Brazil's president has decided that he will handle [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=464.5s)]
*  that very embarrassing turn of events the way I'm sure we all wish we could. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=467.5s)]
*  He has decided that he will dump it down the memory hole and close the door on it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=473.5s)]
*  Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's president today, decreed that all public records [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=478.5s)]
*  concerning that very bad timing three-day official trip he took to Moscow [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=484.5s)]
*  right before Putin launched his war, all public records of that will now be sealed [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=490.5s)]
*  for at least five years. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=496.5s)]
*  So even though he went to Moscow and told everybody that Putin was going to start [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=499.5s)]
*  no war and that Brazil stood with Russia, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=503.5s)]
*  no one is allowed to know what happened on that trip. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=507.5s)]
*  Or nobody's even allowed to know who else was traveling with Bolsonaro on that trip [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=510.5s)]
*  until at least 2027. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=515.5s)]
*  The records have been sealed for five years. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=518.5s)]
*  And just like that, you know, he's assuming it will all be forgotten. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=522.5s)]
*  Maybe it will be. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=527.5s)]
*  You may remember that at the very start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=529.5s)]
*  Chernobyl was one of the very first places that Putin sent in Russian soldiers to occupy. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=533.5s)]
*  Now, why Putin sent Russian soldiers to occupy Chernobyl, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=538.5s)]
*  we still don't really understand. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=542.5s)]
*  But we're finally now starting to get a better idea of what the Russians did [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=545.5s)]
*  while they were at that site. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=549.5s)]
*  This is from the Associated Press today. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=551.5s)]
*  Dateline Chernobyl, Ukraine, quote, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=553.5s)]
*  In the earliest hours of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=555.5s)]
*  thousands of tanks and troops rumbled into the forested Chernobyl exclusion zone, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=558.5s)]
*  churning up highly contaminated soil from the site of the 1986 accident [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=563.5s)]
*  that was the world's worst nuclear disaster. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=568.5s)]
*  In the dirt of one of the world's most radioactive places, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=571.5s)]
*  Russian soldiers dug trenches. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=574.5s)]
*  Ukrainian officials worry they may have been digging their own graves. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=577.5s)]
*  For more than a month, some Russian soldiers bunked in the earth [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=581.5s)]
*  within sight of the massive structure built to contain radiation [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=585.5s)]
*  from the damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=589.5s)]
*  A close inspection of the trenches they dug and that they lived in [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=592.5s)]
*  was impossible today because even walking on that dirt is discouraged. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=596.5s)]
*  Because of radioactivity. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=600.5s)]
*  The deputy head of the state agency that manages the Chernobyl exclusion zone [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=603.5s)]
*  told the AP today that he believes hundreds or thousands of soldiers [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=607.5s)]
*  damaged their health, likely with little idea of the consequences, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=611.5s)]
*  despite plant workers' warnings to their commanders. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=615.5s)]
*  He told the AP today, quote, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=618.5s)]
*  Most of the soldiers were around 20 years old. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=620.5s)]
*  The full extent of Russia's activities in the Chernobyl exclusion zone [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=624.5s)]
*  is still unknown, says the AP today, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=628.5s)]
*  especially because the troops scattered mines [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=631.5s)]
*  that the Ukrainian military is still searching for. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=634.5s)]
*  Some of those mines have detonated, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=637.5s)]
*  further disturbing the radioactive ground at the site. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=639.5s)]
*  The Russians also set several forest fires at the Chernobyl exclusion zone. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=642.5s)]
*  Ukrainian authorities cannot monitor radiation levels [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=647.5s)]
*  across the Chernobyl exclusion zone today [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=650.5s)]
*  because Russian soldiers stole the main server for the system. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=653.5s)]
*  Severing the connection on March 2, just days after they occupied the site. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=657.5s)]
*  The Russians even took Chernobyl staffers' personal radiation monitors. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=661.5s)]
*  So they're operating without those now, too. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=666.5s)]
*  Why did they do that? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=669.5s)]
*  And did they have any idea what they were doing? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=672.5s)]
*  I mean, these Russian soldiers blundered into Chernobyl [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=675.5s)]
*  right at the start of the war. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=681.5s)]
*  They stayed for five weeks, apparently, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=683.5s)]
*  with no idea what they were getting into. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=685.5s)]
*  Only now are we starting to learn how fantastically reckless [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=688.5s)]
*  and presumably ignorant they were about one of the most radioactive places on Earth. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=692.5s)]
*  The International Atomic Energy Agency said today [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=697.5s)]
*  that the head of the IAEA is going to lead a mission of nuclear experts [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=700.5s)]
*  to Chernobyl sometime in the next two weeks [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=704.5s)]
*  to try to assess how much damage was done by the Russian occupation there. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=706.5s)]
*  They say they're going to do, quote, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=710.5s)]
*  And they're also going to try to set up new monitoring systems [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=712.5s)]
*  to replace the ones the Russians all looted and stole, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=719.5s)]
*  presumably without even knowing what they were for. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=722.5s)]
*  But all this is happening, of course, while the war is still underway in Ukraine. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=727.5s)]
*  While Russia appears hell-bent on taking over, you know, all of Ukraine, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=731.5s)]
*  or at least all of it they can destroy enough to seize. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=735.5s)]
*  And while the Russian soldiers that occupied the Chernobyl exclusion zone are out of there now, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=738.5s)]
*  that's why the AP was able to get in there today, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=743.5s)]
*  Russian soldiers as of right now, as of tonight, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=746.5s)]
*  they're still at a nuclear power plant that isn't mothballed and stuck under a dome like Chernobyl. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=749.5s)]
*  They're still at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine that is currently operating. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=755.5s)]
*  Russian soldiers right now are still occupying the largest currently operating nuclear power plant in Ukraine, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=759.5s)]
*  which is also the largest nuclear power plant in all of Europe. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=766.5s)]
*  Russian soldiers are there now. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=770.5s)]
*  We know what they did while they were in Chernobyl. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=773.5s)]
*  How are they doing with the one that's currently operating right now, right? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=776.5s)]
*  Just as we're learning the extent to which these guys respect and understand [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=779.5s)]
*  and can be trusted with all things nuclear, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=782.5s)]
*  there's all this attention as to whether or not Putin wants to use nuclear weapons in the fight in Ukraine. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=785.5s)]
*  What about the nuclear damage his troops are doing on the ground at nuclear power sites? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=791.5s)]
*  Joining us now is James Acton. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=797.5s)]
*  He's the co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=798.5s)]
*  Mr. Acton, I appreciate you taking the time to be with us tonight. Thank you. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=802.5s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=806.5s)]
*  I'm not an expert on these things. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=808.5s)]
*  I am a lay observer just trying to sort of absorb this information. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=810.5s)]
*  You are an expert. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=814.5s)]
*  Let me just ask you if I described any of that wrong or if I got any of it the wrong way around. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=815.5s)]
*  No, I think that was a very good picture, a very good summary of the nuclear situation on the ground at the moment. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=820.5s)]
*  My primary concern is about the nuclear power plant that Russia is currently occupying at Zaporizhzhia. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=826.5s)]
*  That's an operating plant. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=834.5s)]
*  It needs much more active cooling than Chernobyl does. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=836.5s)]
*  The spent fuel on the site is much more highly radioactive. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=839.5s)]
*  It's not surrounded by a large exclusion zone. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=843.5s)]
*  So Russia's behavior at Chernobyl was reckless. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=846.5s)]
*  It was dangerous. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=850.5s)]
*  But I think the big immediate nuclear power accident risk during this war has always been the operating plants. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=851.5s)]
*  And, you know, fortunately, Russia has now left Chernobyl, albeit in a much worse state than it found it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=860.5s)]
*  But as you importantly pointed out, Zaporizhzhia is still under occupation. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=867.5s)]
*  And Zaporizhzhia, forgive my pronunciation. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=872.5s)]
*  That's as close as I can get. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=874.5s)]
*  It is a gigantic plant. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=876.5s)]
*  It is currently operating. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=877.5s)]
*  And as you say, one of the imperatives there for a currently operating plant is active cooling. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=878.5s)]
*  You need, I mean, for a plant that generates a lot of power, it also needs to have a power source that allows it to actively and constantly cool the hot fuel rods that are a byproduct of the production of nuclear power at a facility like this. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=884.5s)]
*  In a war zone like Ukraine, especially one that's grinding on into this many days of war with this kind of like artillery driven combat, it seems like keeping the power on for a big plant like that or for any of the nuclear power plants in Ukraine is not at all a sure thing. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=899.5s)]
*  And that that alone could potentially be a very dangerous thing. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=913.5s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=918.5s)]
*  You know, under normal conditions, an accident at a nuclear power plant is very unlikely because you have all of these different safety systems. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=919.5s)]
*  In place. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=928.5s)]
*  So you have an electricity grid connection to provide energy to the cooling and multiple electricity grid connections. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=929.5s)]
*  If they fail, you have emergency backup diesel generators. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=937.5s)]
*  You often have other kinds of batteries on the plant. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=941.5s)]
*  The problem is in a war, a failure of all of these different systems together becomes much more likely than it does in peacetime. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=944.5s)]
*  You know, you can easily imagine a fire starting the war, which is in fact what we saw at Zaporizhzhia a month or so ago. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=953.5s)]
*  You can imagine that fire knocks out the grid connection could threaten emergency diesel generators. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=960.5s)]
*  Under normal circumstances, you could have fire crews come to the plant to try to put out the fire. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=967.5s)]
*  But when that happened a few months ago, we saw those firefighters were literally shot at. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=974.5s)]
*  They couldn't get to the plant for a while. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=979.5s)]
*  Now, fortunately, the fire that we saw a month or so ago was in an auxiliary building, wasn't in the actual reactor itself. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=981.5s)]
*  But given that Zaporizhzhia is illegally occupied at the moment, like other parts of Ukraine, it's hardly seems that unlikely we could see renewed fighting around that plant and deliberately or inadvertently. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=988.5s)]
*  One could imagine damage to that plant or a fire or damage to power supplies or cooling systems that led to a serious accident because all of these different layers of defense that are normally in place around it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1003.5s)]
*  You click in place around a nuclear power plant and that under normal circumstances, simultaneous failures, all of these different cooling systems, all of these different safety systems would be very unlikely. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1020.5s)]
*  It's much more imaginable in a war that you could have this kind of series of cascading failures leading to a serious accident. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1031.5s)]
*  I think that Vladimir Putin has proven himself to be unpredictable and that he's proven to be willing to do things that were previously thought of as unthinkable. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1037.5s)]
*  Today, I'm conscious of the fact that the Finnish parliament in Finland, they just started debating whether or not they're going to join NATO. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1046.5s)]
*  That's one of the things where he threatened that he would put nuclear weapons more in play, put nuclear weapons in the Baltics. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1052.5s)]
*  If Finland and perhaps Sweden think about joining NATO, we also saw this test of the very highly touted test of a presumably new type of nuclear weapon today by Russia. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1058.5s)]
*  CNN today quoted U.S. officials saying they're more concerned about the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons than at any time since the Cold War. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1070.5s)]
*  How do you feel about that risk as somebody who studies these things for a living? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1077.5s)]
*  I absolutely cannot rule out the possibility of Russian nuclear use. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1081.5s)]
*  I am less worried about this than I was a month or two back. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1086.5s)]
*  At the beginning of war, you remember that first Sunday of the war, Putin came out and made a very explicit nuclear threat. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1090.5s)]
*  And I was pretty nervous at that point, not about the immediate Russian nuclear use, but about the fact that about the possibility of nuclear escalation. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1098.5s)]
*  I can't exclude that possibility today. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1107.5s)]
*  But the war has progressed in a way that makes me think it's less likely than it was a month or so ago. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1110.5s)]
*  Putin has scaled back his war aims. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1118.5s)]
*  He's now mostly focusing on east of Ukraine, which means that he has, you know, if you scale down your aims and you don't achieve them, the gap there is not as big as if he'd been continuing to go after the whole of Ukraine. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1121.5s)]
*  I think another condition that would make him more likely to use nuclear weapons is if his hold on power was seriously threatened. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1139.5s)]
*  We're not seeing that at the moment. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1145.5s)]
*  He still appears to be very popular in Russia because he has complete control of the media. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1147.5s)]
*  But nonetheless, and the Russian economy, while it's in a bad state, it doesn't appear to be on the verge of complete collapse. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1152.5s)]
*  So I think, you know, from Putin's perspective, I think he absolutely realizes that using nuclear weapons would be a risky and dangerous thing to do. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1162.5s)]
*  And I think he would only use them if he thought the risks of using them were smaller than the risks of not using them, because the consequences of not using them were so dire in his opinion. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1172.5s)]
*  I think the good news is we're not all that close to that position today. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1181.5s)]
*  None of this detracts from Putin's exceptionally reckless and dangerous behavior of Russian forces, the nuclear saber rattling that we're continuing to see in the form of the test of the new ICBM today. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1185.5s)]
*  But I am somewhat less worried than I was a month or so ago about the possibility of Russian nuclear use. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1197.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASCZLX9ALW4&t=1215.5s)]
