# Breyer Supreme Court Retirement Puts Spotlight On Biden Campaign Promise
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0)
*  Just as there had never been a woman on the Supreme Court before Ronald Reagan promised it and then made it happen, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=0.0s)]
*  there has also to this day never been a black woman Supreme Court justice. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=6.0s)]
*  Joe Biden promised in the campaign this past year that he would make that happen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=11.0s)]
*  Well, now today, upon the retirement of longtime Justice Stephen Breyer, that pledge from Joe Biden is operative. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=15.0s)]
*  The White House is reminded of it today, says President Biden, plans to stick to that pledge. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=22.0s)]
*  And yes, conservatives are going crazy about it, pretending there's absolutely no precedent for this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=29.0s)]
*  And this is an outrageous thing that Joe Biden promised to do. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=34.0s)]
*  Like Ronald Reagan didn't exist. Ronald who? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=38.0s)]
*  It's also worth knowing, though, that when Joe Biden made this pledge during the campaign, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=42.0s)]
*  this pledge that he is now going to live by and that's going to make that's going to that's going to shape the history from here on out over these next few days and months until we get the new nominee on the court. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=46.0s)]
*  I mean, when Joe Biden made this pledge, which we are now going to live by, it was a really consequential thing when he did it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=57.0s)]
*  It had a huge political impact when he did it. And it was also no sure thing that he was going to do it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=66.0s)]
*  At least by one account, his most influential staff members on the campaign told him as late as the day as he made the pledge that he shouldn't do it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=73.0s)]
*  This is this is from a book about the Biden campaign by reporters Jonathan Allen and Amy Parnes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=84.0s)]
*  The book is called Lucky, How Joe Biden Barely Won the Presidency. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=89.0s)]
*  This is such a great anecdote from the book. Check this out. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=93.0s)]
*  Jim Clyburn had heard enough or really not enough. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=96.0s)]
*  The House Democratic whip pushed himself out of his seat at Charleston's Gayard Center Concert Hall. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=99.0s)]
*  He dashed for the exit with the urgency that friends recognized as a 79 year old man's hurry to find a restroom. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=104.0s)]
*  But Clyburn, forgive me, didn't need to pee. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=111.0s)]
*  He needed to find Joe Biden and fast before the end of a commercial break during that night's presidential debate. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=114.0s)]
*  It was February 25th, four days before the South Carolina primary, and Biden was blowing it again. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=121.0s)]
*  Almost an hour and 45 minutes had passed in the debate already. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=128.0s)]
*  And Biden hadn't mentioned the one promise Jim Clyburn had said would nail down black votes in South Carolina throughout the rest of the primary and in the general election. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=131.0s)]
*  Clyburn was shocked, but not stunned. He made a beeline for the backstage area. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=140.0s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg approached to greet the most powerful Democrat in South Carolina politics. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=145.0s)]
*  Clyburn brushed Mayor Pete aside. His eyes darted around and he finally found Biden. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=149.0s)]
*  They huddled together out of earshot of the other candidates. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=154.0s)]
*  There wasn't much time until Biden had to be back on stage for the final segment of the debate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=157.0s)]
*  Quote, you've had a couple of opportunities to mention naming a black woman to the Supreme Court. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=161.0s)]
*  Clyburn lectured his friend of nearly half a century like a school teacher scolding a child. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=166.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, don't you leave the stage tonight without making it known that you will do that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=172.0s)]
*  Biden had seemed to get it the night before when Clyburn talked to him at a Congressional Black Caucus reception aboard the USS Yorktown, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=177.0s)]
*  a decommissioned aircraft carrier that sat in Charleston Harbor as part of a naval museum. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=184.0s)]
*  Biden was desperate to get Clyburn's endorsement. Very few endorsements carry weight in modern politics. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=189.0s)]
*  In South Carolina, though, a perception had built up that Clyburn's imprimatur meant everything. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=194.0s)]
*  Voters believed it. The media believed it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=200.0s)]
*  Even most political insiders thought there was at least a good helping of truth in it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=202.0s)]
*  There was no black political figure in the history of the state of South Carolina who had more influence with black voters, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=206.0s)]
*  either in South Carolina or across the deep south. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=212.0s)]
*  James Clyburn wanted to endorse Biden. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=216.0s)]
*  In fact, he had no intention of endorsing any other candidate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=218.0s)]
*  But he could also see how badly the wheels had come off Biden's campaign earlier. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=221.0s)]
*  And he was a savvy enough politician to know that there wasn't much point in endorsing someone who was going to lose. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=226.0s)]
*  On the USS Yorktown the night before the debate, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=231.0s)]
*  Clyburn and a few of his CBC colleagues offered Biden counsel and made what amounted to a political ask, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=234.0s)]
*  quote, find a way to say that you were a part of picking the first Latina woman member of the United States Supreme Court, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=240.0s)]
*  Sonia Sotomayor, and that you're looking forward to making the first African-American woman a member of the United States Supreme Court, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=247.0s)]
*  Clyburn said. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=255.0s)]
*  Clyburn believed, and there was good evidence to support his view, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=256.0s)]
*  that a Supreme Court justice was worth a lot more to the black community than a vice president. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=259.0s)]
*  VPs come and go, Clyburn thought. Al Gore was vice president. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=264.0s)]
*  Where is he now? But a Supreme Court seat? Well, that's for life. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=268.0s)]
*  The meeting on the Yorktown was fresh in front of mind for Biden the next day as he prepared for that night's debate. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=273.0s)]
*  He understood the difference between a narrow victory and a blowout, his margins with black voters. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=278.0s)]
*  If he committed to naming a black woman to the United States Supreme Court, that might give him a lift. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=283.0s)]
*  I think I should do it, he told his advisors. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=288.0s)]
*  Don't do it, Simone Sanders replied, speaking in concert with the group. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=291.0s)]
*  If he wanted to do it at some point, his advisors agreed with one another. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=297.0s)]
*  He should make a carefully considered plan around announcing that it wasn't the kind of thing he should just throw out there on a debate stage. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=300.0s)]
*  Besides, it might look like he was pandering. It might backfire. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=306.0s)]
*  Biden was torn. But Clyburn and his Congressional Black Caucus colleagues believed their message had landed. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=309.0s)]
*  And so the next night, as Clyburn watched the debate unfold and didn't hear the words come out of Biden's mouth, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=316.0s)]
*  he grew more and more frustrated. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=321.0s)]
*  One opening, two, then three. Why won't he say it? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=323.0s)]
*  Clyburn asked himself. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=327.0s)]
*  Finally, Clyburn took matters into his own hands at that commercial break. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=328.0s)]
*  Backstage, Biden looked his friend in the eye and nodded his assurance. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=333.0s)]
*  Clyburn returned to his seat to watch the end of the debate. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=337.0s)]
*  And then, of course, this is what happened at the end of the debate. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=342.0s)]
*  We talked about the Supreme Court. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=347.0s)]
*  I'm looking forward to making sure there's a black woman on the Supreme Court to make sure we get every representation. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=349.0s)]
*  Not a joke. Not a joke. I pushed very hard for that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=357.0s)]
*  My mother's motto was, she said, you know, you're defined by your courage, you're redeemed by your loyalty. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=361.0s)]
*  I am loyal. I do what I say. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=367.0s)]
*  I am loyal. I do what I say. After being drowned out briefly there by applause in the room. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=370.0s)]
*  I do what I say. What he said he would do is put an African-American woman on the United States Supreme Court if he were elected president and had a nomination to make. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=378.0s)]
*  That was four days before the South Carolina primary. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=385.0s)]
*  It was the first time he had ever made that pledge. You heard the crowd go wild. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=389.0s)]
*  South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn endorsed President Biden the next day in an incredibly emotional, incredibly effective endorsement. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=392.0s)]
*  Clyburn's endorsement is credited to this day by many people with Joe Biden winning South Carolina, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=400.0s)]
*  winning Super Tuesday and ultimately thereby winning the Democratic nomination and the presidency of the United States. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=406.0s)]
*  But Congressman Jim Clyburn himself told NBC News today that what he credits Biden's win in South Carolina to is not actually his own endorsement of Joe Biden. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=412.0s)]
*  What he credits Biden's win in South Carolina to is that pledge that Biden made on the debate stage the night before his endorsement. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=423.0s)]
*  That pledge, Clyburn pushed him backstage to make that an African-American woman would finally be nominated to the nation's highest court for the first time in our country's history if Joe Biden were elected president. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=431.0s)]
*  And now here we are today, January 2022, officially waiting to hear who President Biden's nominee is going to be, knowing he will keep that pledge. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=443.0s)]
*  And having the opportunity now to ask his former advisors from the campaign if it really went down like that and if they really truly did tell him not to do it that night, to not take that leap, not there, not then. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=454.0s)]
*  Joining us now, I am delighted to say, is Simone Sanders, former chief spokesperson for Vice President Harris, former senior advisor in President Biden's presidential campaign. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=466.0s)]
*  Simone also just signed on to host a new show here on MSNBC, which has everybody at MSNBC over the moon. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=476.0s)]
*  Ms. Sanders, it is such a pleasure to have you here and it's such a pleasure that you are joining MSNBC. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=482.0s)]
*  I'm so grateful for you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=487.0s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. I'm happy to be here. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=491.0s)]
*  And I see, I mean, you put the T, as some people would call it, right out there at the top of the show. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=493.0s)]
*  So I love the lead up today. It was great. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=498.0s)]
*  Well, let me ask you, if the account in that book is broadly correct, did you and other advisors to President Biden think that that was a bad thing? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=501.0s)]
*  That was not the right move when he made that pledge at that debate on that debate stage in South Carolina. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=512.0s)]
*  Well, I will note a number of the things in that book are not true, but that is in fact true. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=519.0s)]
*  There was lots of debate in the lead up to that that debate in South Carolina in February about what then candidate Biden should do. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=523.0s)]
*  There was never a question about if the commitment was real, similar to the commitment that the president then candidate Biden made himself [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=532.0s)]
*  about making sure that his running mate would be a woman. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=539.0s)]
*  That is a commitment that Joe Biden himself made, something that he felt very strongly about. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=543.0s)]
*  And similarly is the commitment that he made in February on the debate stage. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=547.0s)]
*  As the book is also true that some folks, myself included, didn't want it to be seen as pandering to just throw it out there on a debate stage [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=551.0s)]
*  and for folks to say that the then candidate Biden was just doing it to get votes of black voters. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=560.0s)]
*  When many of us people who know the president very well, I count myself among those folks know where he stands on those issues. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=565.0s)]
*  I would like to note that Joe Biden, as he usually does, went out there on that debate stage in February and he went with his gut. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=572.0s)]
*  And his gut was right, Rachel. And today you folks all across America were excited. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=581.0s)]
*  I tweeted it was a great day to be a black woman in America with the Juris Doctorate. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=587.0s)]
*  And I think that's absolutely true. And this energy that folks are feeling on the Democratic side of the aisle, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=591.0s)]
*  I think voters and Democrats and strategists would be good to remember that. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=597.0s)]
*  And if I were at the White House right now, I would have asked to get into the meeting and the OPSO meeting, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=601.0s)]
*  the Office of Political Strategy, and say, how are we thinking about galvanizing people around this [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=606.0s)]
*  and keeping the energy up through the rest of this year into the midterm elections? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=612.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prxSRCRZHH0&t=621.0s)]
