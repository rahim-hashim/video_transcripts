# Trump Attacks Created Crisis For American Election Workers, 6th Hearings Show
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk)
*  There is nowhere I feel safe. Nowhere. Do you know how it feels to have the President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=0.0s)]
*  of the United States to target you? The President of the United States is supposed to represent [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=12.32s)]
*  every American, not to target one, but he targeted me, Lady Ruby, a small business owner, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=19.76s)]
*  a mother, a proud American citizen who stand up to help Fulton County run an election in the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=31.6s)]
*  middle of the pandemic. Deposition footage today from Ruby Freeman, who along with her daughter, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=40.0s)]
*  was targeted by name by President Trump and his allies in the effort to try to overturn the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=47.28s)]
*  election. I will say that we have been talking all along throughout all of these hearings [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=52.88s)]
*  about how the committee has been so careful to have all Republicans and or conservatives, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=56.64s)]
*  including lots of Trump appointees as their witnesses, with Shatemoss and then the deposition [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=61.52s)]
*  testimony from Ruby Freeman today, we finally got a different side of this. You know, and I kept [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=65.84s)]
*  thinking about the term patriot, which has been entirely appropriated by like essentially the most [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=69.2s)]
*  fascistic elements of American political life and family values and family values. But like [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=74.32s)]
*  listening to Moss and Freeman speak was just very inspiring. I was like, these people are patriots. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=78.63999999999999s)]
*  They believe in democracy is a calling for them. And like these are patriots. This is what the word [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=86.0s)]
*  actually looks like in reality. But it also it's terrifying to think that this is now what being [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  an election worker is, you know, I mean, we're moving toward a kind of politics where remember [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=95.35999999999999s)]
*  the new Republican strategy is to follow voters to their cars. They now have normalized the idea [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=99.92s)]
*  of using political violence to get the ends they want down to intimidating people, threatening [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=105.12s)]
*  people. This is now Republican politics. And that scares me going forward. It's going to want to do [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=109.92s)]
*  that job. It's also true that their lives are still destroyed. Totally. They're not testifying [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=113.92s)]
*  after the fact. They went still happening. They were thrown into their homes for two months. Where [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  did they go? Who put them up? Did we pay? What do we owe them? I mean, I think the question you asked [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=123.36s)]
*  Secretary Benson, you know, would have prosecution help. So far, there's been no consequences to any [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=128.72s)]
*  of the people who ran the conspiracy to overturn the election. They got a settlement. Ruby Freeman [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=134.56s)]
*  and her daughter got a settlement from one pro-Trump far right media organization that aired [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=138.72s)]
*  the false claims about them. But that's it. But they could be at even bigger risk now that they've [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=143.84s)]
*  gone on TV. Yes. What does justice look like for them? Because all of us are moved. But let's be [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=148.4s)]
*  honest. Three, four, five days from now, are people going to remember these two women's names? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=154.56s)]
*  They're most likely lots of people won't. And they're still at risk. Their lives are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=159.68s)]
*  everybody who testified today. These women in particular, because they're low level election [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=164.4s)]
*  workers, these are not people who are used to having security details and staffs that handle [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=168.16s)]
*  things for them. But Rusty Bowers and Gabe Sterling and Brad Raffensperger, even as high level [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=171.36s)]
*  officials, they also are taking more of a risk by testifying today. Plus those women who have been [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=177.12s)]
*  so much. And you know who's going to remember their names? The wrong people. The MAGA people [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=182.4s)]
*  will remember their names. If they then get run on Fox News and they're in Tucker's Shell when [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=185.2s)]
*  they become the stars of the new, you know, there's always a star of like ugly right-wing media. If [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=189.52s)]
*  then they get beat up again, they're back in the hell again. It's not over. Why does it take so long [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  for this process though, right? It's been 17 months since we heard that Raffensperger-Trump [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=201.68s)]
*  phone call. Raffensperger had the time to write and publish a book in that created time. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=206.56s)]
*  And those women are basically in hiding. Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__tNBgUsGDk&t=210.88s)]
