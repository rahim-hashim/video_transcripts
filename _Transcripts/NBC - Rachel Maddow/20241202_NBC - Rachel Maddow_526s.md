Video Description: Rachel Maddow looks at Donald Trump's shameless abuse of the presidential pardon power and the disgraceful level of nepotism in the early staffing of his second administration, in comparison to President Biden's pardoning of his son, Hunter, to spare him further politically motivated prosecution by Trump's acolytes.

# Maddow: Trump's shameless abuse of pardons, nepotism disqualifies him from criticizing Biden pardon
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0)
*  It is true that President Biden had said he wouldn't pardon his son. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=0.0s)]
*  And it may or may not be related, but would it change your mind at all if, after you made [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  a pledge like that, the incoming next president then announced that he planned to remove the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  director of the FBI and install in his place someone who has literally published a hit [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=16.62s)]
*  list of people he wants to go after once Trump is back in power. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=21.5s)]
*  There are 60 names on this list. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=27.94s)]
*  This guy published it as an appendix, as Appendix B, to one of his recent books. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=30.84s)]
*  Not his series of books that describe Trump as King Donald. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=36.04s)]
*  No, those are his three books for kids. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=39.22s)]
*  No, the one with the 60 names on a list of who he's going to go get in Trump's name [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=41.3s)]
*  once Trump is back in power. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  That's a book he wrote, presumably, for adults. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=47.66s)]
*  So what would you do? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=51.78s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=53.94s)]
*  After you made that pledge to not pardon your son, that's what the next president [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=54.94s)]
*  said he was going to do to U.S. law enforcement. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=61.82s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=64.08s)]
*  What is reasonable to demand of a man? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=65.08s)]
*  After what's been done to your son already, right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=69.22s)]
*  You ready to put him back in the barrel? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=70.97999999999999s)]
*  Honestly, maybe what President Biden should have done is not just pardon his son, Hunter, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=74.34s)]
*  but name him ambassador to France, right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=81.18s)]
*  Only then the response, the criticism of the decision, would be a little more muted. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=84.24s)]
*  I mean, consider it, right? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump, the president-elect, used his pardon power to give pardons to his longest-serving [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=93.0s)]
*  political adviser, his campaign chairman, his campaign manager, his national security [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  adviser. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  He gave pardons to seven, count them, seven different Republican congressmen convicted [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  of dozens of felonies. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=109.44s)]
*  He pardoned the father of his son-in-law. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=113.16s)]
*  His daughter is married to Jared Kushner. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  He pardoned Jared Kushner's father. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=121.24s)]
*  This man tried to blackmail and intimidate a witness in a federal criminal case against [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  him by hiring a prostitute to seduce the witness and lure him back to a hotel room where the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=127.58s)]
*  guy had staged a hidden camera. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=132.96s)]
*  He filmed the sexual encounter and then sent the tape to the wife of the witness to intimidate [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=134.57999999999998s)]
*  both the witness and the wife into not testifying against him. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  And that is an astonishing thing to do, an astonishing length to go to to commit the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=143.54s)]
*  crime of witness intimidation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=147.62s)]
*  It is a whole other level of insanity when you consider that the woman this guy sent [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=149.26s)]
*  the tape to was his own sister, because it was his brother-in-law, his sister's husband, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  who was going to be the witness against him in this criminal investigation, along with [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  potentially his sister herself. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=162.45999999999998s)]
*  So this is what he did to his own sister in order to try to shut down the case, in order [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=165.48s)]
*  to try to shut down those witnesses. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=169.94s)]
*  His name is Charles Kushner. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=173.3s)]
*  His son Jared is married to Ivanka Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=174.82s)]
*  And so he got a pardon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=178.42s)]
*  He got a pardon. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=179.42s)]
*  Charles Kushner served two years in federal prison, but then I'm sure just on the merits [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=180.42s)]
*  of the case, he got a full pardon from Donald Trump in Trump's first term. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=183.94s)]
*  And now this weekend, this weekend, Trump just named him that same guy, that ex-con. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=187.94s)]
*  He just announced that he will name him ambassador to France. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  And he did that announcement right after he announced that the father of the guy married [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=195.76s)]
*  to his other daughter, Tiffany, he will be Trump's senior advisor on the Middle East. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=199.82s)]
*  And so, yeah, cue all the hand-wringing and gnashing of teeth today about a president [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  using his power, his pardon power, his powers as president to do something for a family [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=213.28s)]
*  member. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=220.2s)]
*  I mean, Trump pardoned a family member and then named him ambassador to France. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, he has no qualifications whatsoever to be America's ambassador to France. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=226.28s)]
*  Trump pardoned the owner of the 49ers football team and has now nominated his son-in-law [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  to be the head of the DEA. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=239.44s)]
*  The guy is a local sheriff. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=241.7s)]
*  He has no apparent qualifications to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, other [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=243.16s)]
*  than being a local sheriff and being related to a rich guy who Trump pardoned. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=247.76s)]
*  The surgeon general, Trump just announced, she is a random doctor from the Fox News [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=252.72s)]
*  Channel who has her own celebrity line of vitamins. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=257.0s)]
*  She has no apparent qualifications for being surgeon general at all, other than the fact [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=259.88s)]
*  that she's a doctor. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=263.86s)]
*  And she's the sister-in-law of the guy who he just named to be national security advisor. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  So sure, obviously, why not? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=270.12s)]
*  The guy he's just named to lead the Navy has zero experience with the U.S. Navy or [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  with literally anything having to do with any part of the United States military. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=276.96s)]
*  But the guy did hold a $12 million fundraiser for Trump at his multimillion-dollar home, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=281.23999999999995s)]
*  which famously features a mirrored floor. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=285.68s)]
*  So ha-ha, you can see up people's skirts while they're standing in the living room [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=288.56s)]
*  with the fundraiser. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=292.06s)]
*  You think I'm kidding. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=293.2s)]
*  Look it up. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=294.2s)]
*  Trump named someone who the U.S. government once felt the need to put on a terrorism watchlist [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=296.0s)]
*  to be the new director of national intelligence. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  He named an accused child sex trafficker to be attorney general. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=303.92s)]
*  He named an HHS secretary who says heroin helps him read better and Wi-Fi gives you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=307.74s)]
*  leaky brain. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=314.68s)]
*  And I'm just going to mention this one more time. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=316.64000000000004s)]
*  He named his convicted felon relative to be our nation's ambassador in Paris. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=319.3s)]
*  Maybe his French is excellent. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  But yes, tell me more about how outraged we all are about President Biden's pardon for [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=331.8s)]
*  his son. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=337.48s)]
*  Because that, somehow that is the thing that looks bad. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=339.44s)]
*  Trump himself responded to the pardon news by asking sarcastically whether the pardon [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=347.56s)]
*  includes all the convicted defendants from the violent attack on Congress waged by his [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=351.72s)]
*  supporters on January 6, 2021. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=357.14s)]
*  That reaction from Trump serves to confirm and remind us all that Trump plans to use [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=362.24s)]
*  his pardon power to pardon all of those January 6 convicts, apparently as soon as he's sworn [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  in. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=374.24s)]
*  And so, if this is our national moment to be tutting about pardons, right, to be saying [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=375.24s)]
*  that the use of the pardon power might be a problem and might deserve, like, I don't [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=381.24s)]
*  know, four different simultaneous headlines on the front page of the New York Times right [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  now tonight, then let's talk about this other one. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=390.64s)]
*  Let's talk about the 33-year-old man who lives in Henry County, Georgia, just southeast [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=393.85999999999996s)]
*  of Atlanta. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=397.94s)]
*  Well, he used to live there. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=398.94s)]
*  He doesn't live there anymore. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=401.06s)]
*  Now he lives in prison, where he is serving four years and nine months in prison. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=402.06s)]
*  And this is why. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=406.97999999999996s)]
*  So Trump is indicating that that guy's going to get a pardon. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=420.58s)]
*  Trump is indicating that he's going to pardon all the patriots who were convicted for what [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=450.1s)]
*  they did for him on January 6, which presumably includes this guy wailing away on police officers [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=454.14000000000004s)]
*  using a crutch to try to smash their faces in. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=463.14000000000004s)]
*  I mean, this was Trump's sarcastic response to Biden's pardon announcement today. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=466.22s)]
*  Does the pardon given by Joe include the J-6 hostages? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=471.62s)]
*  This isn't what hostages look like. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=476.78000000000003s)]
*  This is what January 6 looked like from police officers' perspectives. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=479.26s)]
*  And that is the behavior on January 6. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=486.98s)]
*  You see him here dragging a police officer down the steps of the Capitol. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=489.14s)]
*  That's the behavior on January 6 that Trump is praising and promising to use his pardon [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=493.18s)]
*  power for. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=497.58s)]
*  So yeah, tell me all about the scandal of the use of the pardon power. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=500.58s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a good question. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=509.26s)]
*  I think it's a good question. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=512.26s)]
*  I think it's a good question. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-9pk8_LLC0&t=513.26s)]
