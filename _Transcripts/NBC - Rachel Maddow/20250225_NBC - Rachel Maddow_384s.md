# Trump's deportation project falls short of its hype; private 'army' presents concerning option
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ)
*  Change of plans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  CNN is reporting today that the White House has halted plans to house thousands of migrants, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=1.84s)]
*  the so-called worst of the worst, in a giant camp at Guantanamo in Cuba. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=7.74s)]
*  According to CNN, they say this change of plans has come, quote, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=13.52s)]
*  "...amid concerns over conditions for detainees." [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=17.6s)]
*  Concerns over conditions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  It may be true that the folks running Donald Trump's made-for-TV mass deportation operation [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=24.04s)]
*  are worried about the conditions at Guantanamo. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=29.48s)]
*  It could be. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=31.84s)]
*  Or it could be that the epic logistical complications and massive expense of trying to set up a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=32.84s)]
*  pointless diversion to Guantanamo just so they can make propaganda videos about it and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=38.04s)]
*  post them on social media, maybe the embarrassment of having been caught out already not sending [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=42.66s)]
*  the so-called worst of the worst, but instead sending people there with no criminal record [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  at all. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=52.08s)]
*  I mean, whatever the complication of factors that have come together to crash this Trump [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=53.08s)]
*  plan as well just five weeks in. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=57.68s)]
*  Apparently, per CNN's reporting tonight, they have decided that this Guantanamo gambit, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=58.96s)]
*  this too, is just not worth trouble. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=64.56s)]
*  But don't worry. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=68.64s)]
*  There is a new and even more expensive and inexplicable and morally and legally disastrous [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=69.64s)]
*  idea right behind it in line. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=75.12s)]
*  Politico headlined today, quote, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=78.36s)]
*  "...Trump allies circulate mass deportation plan calling for, quote, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=79.92s)]
*  processing camps and a private citizen army." [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=83.76s)]
*  Quote, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=87.28s)]
*  "...a group of prominent military contractors, including former Blackwater CEO Eric Prince," [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=88.28s)]
*  of course, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=94.12s)]
*  "...has pitched the Trump White House on a proposal to carry out mass deportations through [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  a network of processing camps on military bases, a private fleet of 100 airplanes, and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=100.48s)]
*  a, quote, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=107.68s)]
*  "...small army of private citizens empowered to make arrests." [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=108.68s)]
*  The blueprint carries an estimated price tag of $25 billion and recommends a range [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=113.2s)]
*  of aggressive tactics to rapidly deport 12 million people before the 2026 midterms. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=118.0s)]
*  Quote, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=123.92s)]
*  "...it's not clear if the president has seen the plan which has been circulating among [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=124.92s)]
*  Trump allies since December." [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=128.16s)]
*  Eric Prince's partner in the proposal tells Politico they haven't been contacted by or [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=131.76s)]
*  had discussions with the government yet. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=135.68s)]
*  The proposal suggests deputizing 10,000 private citizens, giving them expedited training [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=138.2s)]
*  and the same federal law enforcement powers of immigration officials, including the right [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  to arrest other people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=150.54s)]
*  So $25 billion to have Blackwater set up a private army and a private air force in the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  United States that answers just to Trump and that rounds up people and puts them in camps. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=162.32s)]
*  What could possibly go wrong? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=169.04s)]
*  This seems like a totally well thought out concept and definitely one that'll get really [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=170.76s)]
*  careful consideration if they're going to go through with it, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=176.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Congressman Jason Crowe of Colorado. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=179.04s)]
*  He's a member of the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=180.96s)]
*  Earlier this month, after the Trump administration said a military base in his district would [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=183.4s)]
*  be used to detain migrants, Congressman Crowe personally went to that base and got assurances [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=187.8s)]
*  that it would not be used for that purpose. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=193.24s)]
*  Congressman Crowe, it's a real pleasure to have you with us here tonight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=196.36s)]
*  Thank you for making time. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=198.36s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=201.36s)]
*  What the Trump administration most wants people in rural areas and red areas to think of when [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=202.86s)]
*  they think about this new administration is immigration enforcement. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=208.08s)]
*  This is the thing that they want to be, the thing that they are most known for and that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  they have put the most effort into in terms of public facing media. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=216.56s)]
*  I think some people would sort of credibly argue that they've made a lot of propaganda [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=222.88s)]
*  about what it is they are doing on immigration enforcement. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=226.44s)]
*  I mentioned the CNN reporting earlier that the Trump administration appears to be abandoning [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=229.44s)]
*  its plan to send people to Guantanamo after having a little flurry of activity around [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=234.48s)]
*  that in which they used to create a bunch of propaganda. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=240.16s)]
*  Now they're not going to do it anymore. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=242.76s)]
*  There's also now reporting in Politico that they're considering a $25 billion program [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=244.56s)]
*  to privatize immigration enforcement and have essentially mercenaries do it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=250.64s)]
*  Some of the language and the planning and the activity around this thus far seems almost [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=255.88s)]
*  surreal. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=260.6s)]
*  From the vantage point of your district in Colorado, what do you make of the reality [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=261.6s)]
*  of what they're doing and what they're trying to sell their voters on what they're doing? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=265.56s)]
*  Well, there's a couple of common strands to a lot of things that the Trump administration [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=271.12s)]
*  is doing. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=276.2s)]
*  If there is a way to privatize something and to pad the pockets of their billionaire donors [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=277.8s)]
*  and their buddies, they will do it, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=281.88s)]
*  Even if it's more expensive, they will do it in this scheme to privatize immigration [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=284.84s)]
*  enforcement to private mercenaries. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=290.32s)]
*  And it has the added bonus for them of hiding things, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=292.64s)]
*  They like to hide things. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=295.76s)]
*  They like to funnel money to their friends and to large corporations. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=297.2s)]
*  So that is generally what happens in a lot of these cases with the Trump administration. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=301.12s)]
*  But the impact here—let's just paint a picture for Aurora and for Colorado, right? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  A lot of folks who I even know who voted for Donald Trump said their number one issue was [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=311.24s)]
*  the cost of living. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  They couldn't afford groceries. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=316.62s)]
*  They couldn't afford rent. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=317.62s)]
*  And that is what they were hoping that Donald Trump would deliver for them. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=319.20000000000005s)]
*  They are doing nothing to address that issue. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=323.68s)]
*  In fact, to the contrary, the two ways to make the cost of living that go up the quickest [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=325.88s)]
*  would be to impose unnecessary or broad tariffs into threatened deportation of vast swaths [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=330.8s)]
*  of the workforce, because we already have a labor shortage, which all of the companies [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  and small businesses and manufacturers in my district tell me that if this moves forward [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=342.04s)]
*  and they lose the workforce, prices will go up instantly overnight. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=346.36s)]
*  So they're actually going to make the problem worse just from an economic perspective. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=350.56s)]
*  That's not even talking about the moral component of taking children and families, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  including U.S. citizen children in some cases, according to Tom Homan, and deporting these folks. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LLv2ZKofKQ&t=358.52s)]
