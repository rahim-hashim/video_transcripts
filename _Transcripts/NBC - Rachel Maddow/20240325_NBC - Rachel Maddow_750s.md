Video Description: Rachel Maddow looks at the role that Ronna McDaniel played as chair of the Republican National Committee in taking someone who would otherwise be a fringe character in American politics, Donald Trump, and helping legitimize him with the authority of the Republican Party and then joining in his project to eject democracy as the American system of government, in favor of a strongman system led by Trump

# Maddow joins colleagues in objecting to McDaniel for legitimizing Trump, attacking democracy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU)
*  The person who was the head of the Republican Party during Donald Trump's time in office [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=0.0s)]
*  and during his effort to throw out the election result and stay in power anyway, and during [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  his effort to run for election again after having done that, is Ronna Romney McDaniel. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=9.76s)]
*  And she pitched in and helped. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=19.52s)]
*  She helped set in motion the part of the plot that involved sending fake Trump electors [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=22.52s)]
*  to Congress from states that Trump did not win. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=27.56s)]
*  So Republicans in Washington could use those fake fraudulent electors to contend that maybe [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=31.04s)]
*  Trump did win those states even though he didn't. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=37.04s)]
*  And don't believe me on that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=40.6s)]
*  There she is on page 23 and page 27 of the federal indictment charging Donald Trump with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  conspiring to defraud the United States. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=47.739999999999995s)]
*  There's her personal appearance in this scene of the crime as alleged by the U.S. Justice [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=50.12s)]
*  Department in this ongoing criminal case. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=54.9s)]
*  In Michigan, where the fake electors are themselves now on trial, she told the state of Michigan [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  in writing explicitly, do not certify the election results. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=64.54s)]
*  The Detroit News has reported that with Donald Trump on the phone with her, she directed [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=68.42s)]
*  Michigan election officials to not certify the vote. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=73.22s)]
*  She told them, quote, do not sign it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=76.84s)]
*  We will get you lawyers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=80.56s)]
*  She pitched in. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=84.66s)]
*  She was part of the project. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=85.7s)]
*  And what was the project? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=88.52s)]
*  It was to use the power of the Republican Party, Republican officials in the states, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=89.7s)]
*  Republican officeholders in Washington, the national Republican Party that she runs, to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=94.46s)]
*  use the party's power to reject election results, to take over the government and hold power [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=99.62s)]
*  by other means. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  And this project is now ongoing, right? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=106.82s)]
*  Now the project is to tell the American people that those efforts around the 2020 election [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=109.78s)]
*  were righteous. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=116.3s)]
*  That 2020 election, it wasn't OK. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=117.3s)]
*  Those election results were not correct. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=121.06s)]
*  We shouldn't believe American elections. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=123.14s)]
*  We shouldn't believe American elections are real elections. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=125.54s)]
*  American election results should not be seen as real. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=128.66s)]
*  They should not be respected. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=131.26s)]
*  That's the project now, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=132.9s)]
*  I mean, it didn't work to overthrow the government the last time. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=133.9s)]
*  But as long as you can build on that first effort, as long as you can keep up the anti-election [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=136.38s)]
*  mythology, then you are priming your people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  You're priming the American public to not accept the results of the next election either. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=145.54s)]
*  You're telling them that they're going to need to take power by other means because [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=151.94s)]
*  the election isn't going to be how we do it anymore. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=155.1s)]
*  You're also priming people, honestly, to vote to give up this supposed democracy we have [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=160.46s)]
*  because what good is it anyway? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=164.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=166.9s)]
*  So what are we really losing if we if we decide we're going to lose this? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=167.9s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  Elections are fraudulent here anyway. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=173.9s)]
*  Who cares if we give them up? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=175.7s)]
*  Ronald McDaniel has been pitching in on that too, continuing to say since 2020 that that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=178.42s)]
*  election wasn't right, that the American public should know that that vote wasn't real. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=184.06s)]
*  And that is a message not only about 2020, but about this next election and about whether [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=188.34s)]
*  or not elections should matter at all and whether we should bother having them at all. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=192.98s)]
*  The Republican Party getting behind that message is a choice. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=198.17999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Trump himself is going to do what he wants to do. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  We've always had guys like Trump. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=205.17999999999998s)]
*  Sometimes they were ridiculous little uniforms, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=207.94s)]
*  But we've always had guys like that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  We've never before had a big storied, important American political institution embrace a guy [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=212.33999999999997s)]
*  like that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=219.17999999999998s)]
*  Even when it came to overthrowing the American system of government. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=221.3s)]
*  And in a time like this, it's hard, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=229.66000000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is a challenging and worrying time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=234.5s)]
*  Republican officials have to figure out whether they're going to stand up for the American [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=239.26000000000002s)]
*  system of government or not. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=242.62s)]
*  Congress has to decide if it's going to assert its own relevance. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=248.1s)]
*  They're going to assert their own independence, their own role in the government and stand [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  up for our system of government or not. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=256.14s)]
*  Judges and prosecutors have to decide if they're going to be braver than they ever thought [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=260.7s)]
*  they'd have to be in this job. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=264.58s)]
*  They have to decide whether they're going to stand up to the threats and the violence. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=266.98s)]
*  And nevertheless, be independent, be fearless, stand up for their own independence and thereby [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=272.54s)]
*  stand up for our system of government. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=279.14s)]
*  Regular citizens have to decide if we're going to brave the threats and the violence, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=281.9s)]
*  to stay involved in politics, to work for campaigns, to volunteer as election workers [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=288.34000000000003s)]
*  despite all the threats, all the attacks, all the violence, to stand up for our system [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=293.9s)]
*  of government. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=298.54s)]
*  And then there's the press, which is both reporting on all of this and is also part [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=302.3s)]
*  of it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=308.62s)]
*  Because just as a strongman needs to control the judicial branch or get rid of it, needs [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=309.94s)]
*  to control the Congress or get rid of it, needs to control the political opposition [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=314.5s)]
*  or get rid of it, what the strongman most desires before all of that, the necessary [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=318.34000000000003s)]
*  precursor to all of that, is to control the free press or get rid of it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=322.62s)]
*  And, you know, in the press, we do not take it personally when we get attacked. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=329.94s)]
*  When they, you know, say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason, we [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=336.78s)]
*  don't take it personally. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=341.18s)]
*  But we do defend ourselves as an institution, not because we're personally offended by [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=344.02s)]
*  the way that we're treated, but because a free and uncowed press is necessary for our [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=349.46s)]
*  democracy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=353.98s)]
*  A free and uncowed press is part of our system of government. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=355.70000000000005s)]
*  We stand up for ourselves as a way of standing up for our country and for our Constitution, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=360.18s)]
*  the First Amendment to which makes it possible for us to exist at all. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=365.26000000000005s)]
*  And so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues, both at MSNBC and at NBC News, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=373.3s)]
*  who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company putting on the payroll someone [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  who hasn't just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=385.38s)]
*  to get rid of our system of government. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=391.7s)]
*  Someone who still is trying to convince Americans that this election stuff, it doesn't really [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=395.46s)]
*  work, that this last election, it wasn't a real result. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=401.3s)]
*  That American elections are fraudulent. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=407.06s)]
*  Is that argument that is a necessary part, that is the most necessary part of the overall [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=411.38s)]
*  project of getting us as Americans to give up on this election stuff? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=416.3s)]
*  Because wouldn't we rather have a real man in charge anyway, somebody who could really [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=420.18s)]
*  get some stuff done, if only we could clear away all the things in his way? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=423.18s)]
*  We have a long history in this country of forgettable men telling us that we need a [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=429.02s)]
*  new system of government where everything's under their control and politics is over. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=434.3s)]
*  And this new strong man way of government is going to make America great again. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=438.82s)]
*  We have had a lot of these guys. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=442.86s)]
*  But our generation's version of this guy has gotten a lot farther than all the rest of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=446.46s)]
*  them. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=454.34s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=456.18s)]
*  He would have been as forgotten as all the rest of them had he not been able to attach [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=457.46s)]
*  institution like the Republican Party and had the leader of that party in his time not [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=464.53999999999996s)]
*  decided that she wouldn't just abide him, she would help. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=470.34s)]
*  She would help with the worst of it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=475.74s)]
*  It's my understanding that MSNBC's leadership did not object to Ronald McDaniel being hired [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=481.21999999999997s)]
*  by NBC News when the matter first arose. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=486.7s)]
*  But when the hiring was announced, and MSNBC staff essentially unanimously and instantly [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=489.58s)]
*  expressed outrage, our leadership at MSNBC heard us, understood and adjusted course. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=497.82s)]
*  We were told this weekend in clear terms, Ronald McDaniel will not be on our air. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=505.62s)]
*  Ronald McDaniel will not be on MSNBC. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=511.26s)]
*  I say that and give you that level of detail because there has been an effort since by [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=515.34s)]
*  other parts of the company to muddy that up in the press and make it seem like that's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=522.26s)]
*  not what happened at MSNBC. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=526.5s)]
*  I can assure you that is what happened at MSNBC. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=528.22s)]
*  Ronald McDaniel will not appear on MSNBC, so says our boss since Saturday, and it has [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=531.66s)]
*  never been anything other than clear. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=537.42s)]
*  I will also say, if you care what I think about this, I will tell you the fact that [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=541.66s)]
*  Ms. McDaniel is on the payroll at NBC News, to me that is inexplicable. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=545.26s)]
*  You wouldn't hire a wise guy, you wouldn't hire a made man like a mobster to work at [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=552.0600000000001s)]
*  a DA's office. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=560.94s)]
*  You wouldn't hire a pickpocket to work as a TSA screener. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=563.78s)]
*  And so I find the decision to put her on the payroll inexplicable and I hope they will [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=567.86s)]
*  reverse their decision. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=574.22s)]
*  And it's not about, you know, Democratic Party, Republican Party, it's not about partisanship, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=575.78s)]
*  it's not about right versus left, it's not about being a political professional versus [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=581.02s)]
*  some other kinds of person, it's not about being mean or nice to journalists, it's not [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=584.62s)]
*  about just being associated with Donald Trump and his time in the Republican Party. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=589.82s)]
*  It's not even about lying or not lying. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=594.3000000000001s)]
*  It's about our system of government and undermining elections and going after democracy as an [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=596.42s)]
*  ongoing project, right? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=604.78s)]
*  And this is a difficult time for us as a country. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=608.74s)]
*  And I think that means we need to be clear-eyed about the implications of it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=613.3s)]
*  Difficult times make for difficult decisions. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=618.86s)]
*  We are contending with something we've never had to contend with before. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=620.7199999999999s)]
*  In the news business, yes, we are covering an election, which we do all the time, but [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=624.48s)]
*  we're also covering bad actors trying to use the rights and privileges of a democracy to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=627.84s)]
*  end democracy. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=632.32s)]
*  The chief threat among them now is not the rioters and the kooks, but the slick political [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=633.64s)]
*  professionals who are turning their considerable talents to laundering violently revolutionary [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=638.24s)]
*  claims that America's elections aren't real, that election results aren't real, and that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  they shouldn't be respected. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=647.32s)]
*  We are contending with this now, not from William Dudley Pelley's brown-shirt militias, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=648.8000000000001s)]
*  right, but from the multi-billion dollar massive political operation of one of the two governing [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=653.56s)]
*  parties of the United States of America. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=658.16s)]
*  And that's new. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=662.4399999999999s)]
*  And with our country up against something that daunting and that scary and that dangerous [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=664.16s)]
*  for the country, I think bad decisions will inevitably happen. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=669.96s)]
*  Mistakes will be made. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=675.0799999999999s)]
*  But part of our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing, us recognizing [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=677.48s)]
*  when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=686.08s)]
*  Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=693.52s)]
*  Not digging in, not blaming others. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=699.12s)]
*  Take a minute. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=704.28s)]
*  Acknowledge that maybe it wasn't the right call. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=706.0s)]
*  It is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=708.4399999999999s)]
*  It is a sign of strength. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=712.76s)]
*  And our country needs us to be strong right now. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqassXP6HAU&t=716.68s)]
