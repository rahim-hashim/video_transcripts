# Maddow: Trump's belligerent behavior at campaign's end suggests mental deterioration
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo)
*  I'm surprised that Bill de Blasio was actually able to make it tonight, to be honest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=0.0s)]
*  He was a terrible man. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  I don't give a f*** if this is comedy or not. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=9.24s)]
*  He was a terrible man. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=12.76s)]
*  He did a horrible job. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  People wrote about that moment like he was telling a joke, like he was enjoying himself [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=19.68s)]
*  when he said that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=25.32s)]
*  He clearly was not. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=26.32s)]
*  He was annoyed and aggravated and saying it with no humor at all. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=27.64s)]
*  When Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gave that speech at a Catholic event [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=32.92s)]
*  at the Al Smith dinner last month, it made the crowd sort of increasingly uncomfortable [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=37.88s)]
*  with his swearing and his nasty digs at people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=42.44s)]
*  This was supposed to be a lighthearted, self-deprecating comedy set for a Catholic audience. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  When he instead got up there, I was really mad and started just swearing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=52.44s)]
*  I think we wrote it off as one weird night. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=56.68s)]
*  As I said, there were sort of write-ups of that event that made it seem like maybe that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=60.32s)]
*  was part of a joke. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=65.04s)]
*  It clearly was not. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=66.04s)]
*  But now in retrospect, I think we can see that that night, that very deeply unfunny, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  angry night at the Al Smith dinner, was kind of a signal for how the close of the campaign [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=74.44s)]
*  was going to go. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=80.08s)]
*  The campaign close started there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=83.0s)]
*  It has since included the big rally in Madison Square Garden with the Trump warm-up act, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=85.2s)]
*  calling Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage, calling Kamala Harris the devil, and flipping [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  middle fingers at the cameras. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  There was also the rally in Pennsylvania where Trump waxed poetic about the size of another [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=97.92s)]
*  man's penis and then swore while he was describing Kamala Harris. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=104.2s)]
*  He screamed out angrily, you're an S-word, vice president. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=109.04s)]
*  If you want to take the data-driven approach, the New York Times found that Trump resorted [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=114.24s)]
*  to swear words in public at least 140 times just this year. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=118.6s)]
*  He swears so much more now than he did in the 2016 campaign, for example, that some [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=123.6s)]
*  experts told the New York Times that his profusion of profanity could be a sign of an aging brain. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=128.2s)]
*  It's one of the things that happens when you get to sort of super-senior status. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  If you've ever been royally cussed out by a very elderly relative you didn't know had [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=139.88s)]
*  it in her, you know what I mean. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=144.28s)]
*  But even beyond all the surprising and unfunny, angry swearing, Trump's closing message in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=148.48s)]
*  his campaign, it just hasn't sounded like the kind of stuff you say when you want people [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  to vote for you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=157.5s)]
*  Yesterday, for example, Trump told a rally that his second term will, quote, be nasty [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=158.5s)]
*  a little bit at times and maybe at the beginning in particular. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=163.56s)]
*  Vote for me. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=168.74s)]
*  Nasty. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=169.82000000000002s)]
*  Especially right at first. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=170.82000000000002s)]
*  Who says that to people who want to vote for you? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=173.02s)]
*  His de facto campaign CEO, Elon Musk, is telling people on the closing days of the campaign [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=176.56s)]
*  that they should be prepared for economic hardship if Trump is re-elected. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=181.66s)]
*  Wee vote for him. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=187.38s)]
*  There's also just the strangeness and unnecessariness of so much of the closing message. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=189.5s)]
*  Trump, for example, in his closing events for his campaign has been talking now about [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=196.3s)]
*  rabbits being killed by solar panels. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=200.66000000000003s)]
*  Trump has talked about there being alien life on Mars. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  Elon Musk has assured Trump supporters that there are aliens walking among us. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  Trump fantasized at one of his final campaign rallies about a dinner, like a dinner party [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=215.54000000000002s)]
*  between the long dead mob boss Al Capone and his friend the MyPillow guy, not Al Capone's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=220.82s)]
*  friend, Trump's friend. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=227.29999999999998s)]
*  He wants Al Capone and the MyPillow guy to have a dinner party and he went on and on [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=228.68s)]
*  and on about that in detail. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=233.06s)]
*  This is a closing event for a presidential campaign. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  A closing event where he did not know what state he was in. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=237.06s)]
*  Trying to find a Republican Senate candidate from the wrong state in the crowd. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=240.62s)]
*  One of the things that I think has been surprising to Trump himself, but is maybe not surprising [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=248.06s)]
*  to close observers of his campaign tactics and techniques right now, is that his closing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  rallies have been notably empty. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=258.06s)]
*  His closing rallies have been full of empty seats and lots of the people who have been [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=263.1s)]
*  coming have been leaving early. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  A lot of people are leaving as soon as he starts talking. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=269.90000000000003s)]
*  It's not like Trump's never been able to fill a room before. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=273.86s)]
*  Sure he has. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=275.94s)]
*  He just can't fill one now at the end of his campaign. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=277.06s)]
*  Kamala Harris is not having this problem. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=281.42s)]
*  Her campaign says 75,000 people showed up for her closing argument speech at the ellipse [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=283.1s)]
*  outside the White House last week. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=289.04s)]
*  They had to close down access to the ellipse and shunt people onto the National Mall instead [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=290.74s)]
*  because she filled the space outside the ellipse. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=295.65999999999997s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people there. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=298.26s)]
*  And she was not there talking about rabbits and solar panels. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=300.02s)]
*  Rabbits being hurt by solar panels? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=303.98s)]
*  I still don't get it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=305.46s)]
*  She was not there talking about alien life. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  She was talking about America like this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=310.02s)]
*  The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=313.41999999999996s)]
*  A nation big enough to encompass all our dreams. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=321.97999999999996s)]
*  Strong enough to withstand any fracture or fissure between us. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=328.9s)]
*  And fearless enough to imagine a future of possibilities. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=337.02s)]
*  Kamala Harris, the United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=344.34s)]
*  That's one way to close a campaign. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=352.26s)]
*  Or you could take a slightly different tack. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=353.94s)]
*  We're a dumping ground. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=357.34s)]
*  We're like a garbage can for the world. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=358.34s)]
*  That's what's happened. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=362.58s)]
*  That's what's happened to us. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=363.58s)]
*  We're like a garbage can. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=366.06s)]
*  Put that on a bumper sticker, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=368.94s)]
*  From one campaign, America is a garbage can. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=371.38s)]
*  A garbage can for the world. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=374.58s)]
*  America is garbage. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=376.5s)]
*  The other campaign says America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=378.62s)]
*  Choose your fighter. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=384.62s)]
*  One more day. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQ_DMYsNDo&t=387.5s)]
