# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Aug. 22
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY)
*  Let me first just get your reaction to this breaking news from the New York Times tonight, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=0.0s)]
*  quantifying for the first time the amount of classified information that may be in question [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=4.24s)]
*  with the former president's estate in Florida. The Times is reporting that the FBI has now obtained [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=9.52s)]
*  more than 300 different classified documents from Trump's home that reportedly include documents [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=15.76s)]
*  from the CIA, the NSA, and the FBI. What's your reaction to that reporting? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=22.64s)]
*  Well, it's staggering, and for all the reasons that you mentioned, just the sheer volume of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=29.12s)]
*  classified documents. It's not like there was a classified paper mixed in with a bunch of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=33.84s)]
*  unrelated information. It seems that it must be quite deliberate if the volume is that great, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=38.96s)]
*  and if the reporting is accurate, it covered a broad range of topics. There goes, frankly, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Rachel, my theory, which was that he was bringing home a bunch of Russia-related documents that he [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  thought might be beneficial to him somehow. If they covered a wide variety of topics, it [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=56.72s)]
*  really begs the question, what was he doing? What was he thinking? What was the purpose behind this? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=62.72s)]
*  And then finally, evidence that he reviewed them himself is going to make it much more [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=67.92s)]
*  difficult to voice responsibility onto others, which, as you point out, is a favorite pastime [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=73.52s)]
*  of the former president. Yeah, that is striking reporting if the Times' [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  reports are accurate, that last year, so before the government was able to start obtaining this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=83.92s)]
*  material and getting it back, Trump, they're saying, personally went through these boxes, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=89.92s)]
*  meaning that he personally reviewed this material before withholding, before deciding to withhold [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  more of the material that was marked classified and not handed over. That would seem to indicate [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=102.0s)]
*  personal, that the president is potentially personally implicated here in a way that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  can't be passed off as a systems problem or a staffing problem or a communication problem, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=111.36s)]
*  right? I think that's exactly right. What has struck me about this story from the beginning, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=116.16s)]
*  and of course, we had no heads up about the search or anything like it, but is the degree to which [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=122.96s)]
*  evidence seems to be coming forward of willfulness. I'm particularly struck, for example, by the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=128.16s)]
*  reporting that one of the Trump lawyers signed an affidavit saying that they had turned over all the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=133.44s)]
*  classified documents when plainly from the search inventory, that wasn't true. Now, was that not [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=139.84s)]
*  true because the lawyer was deliberately misleading people or was it not true because his client had [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=146.56s)]
*  deliberately misled him? I'm sure the Justice Department is trying to find out. From the Intel [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=151.84s)]
*  Committee perspective, though, we're just really frightened of what's in that stockpile, particularly [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  those that are marked top secret SCI, sensitive compartmental information, because those generally [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=162.8s)]
*  mean that there's a very sensitive source involved, like a human source whose life could be put at risk [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=168.48s)]
*  or a technical source that if it's discovered means we're going to have a blind spot where we used to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=174.0s)]
*  be able to see. So we're deeply concerned about all of this. When Mueller turned in that two-volume [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=179.28s)]
*  report to the Justice Department in 2019, he said basically, you know, there's this long-standing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=186.72s)]
*  written Justice Department policy that says we're not supposed to bring charges against a sitting [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  president, so we're not going to bring charges against the sitting president, but we have [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=198.48s)]
*  nevertheless done this investigation. We've collected all the facts. We've preserved the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=202.56s)]
*  evidentiary record. So if charges are warranted here because of Trump's behavior, those criminal [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=207.52s)]
*  charges can be brought against him once he is no longer president, once he is no longer protected [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=214.8s)]
*  by that Justice Department rule that says you can't be criminally charged while you're serving [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=220.24s)]
*  as president of the United States. Mueller turned his report into this guy, to Trump Attorney General [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  William Barr. That's who received the report from Mueller. And right after he got the report, you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  might remember, William Barr released a statement about it. Barr said specifically that he was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  disregarding the Justice Department policy that said a sitting president can't be charged with [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=243.76000000000002s)]
*  crimes. He said, I'm not paying attention to that. He said, regardless of that policy, just ignore [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=248.8s)]
*  that policy, regardless of that rule, I, William Barr, have reviewed all of the evidence and I have [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=253.28s)]
*  determined that no way should Trump face any charges. Not just because he's president, not just [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=259.76s)]
*  because of this rule that says no charges can be brought against a president, but regardless of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=265.04s)]
*  that, Trump shouldn't face any charges because my William Barr review of the evidence in this report [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=268.72s)]
*  indicates that Trump committed no crimes. Barr tells the Congress, he tells the public, I can [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=275.12s)]
*  tell, I checked it out, I looked at all the evidence, I say as Attorney General, and the Justice [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=281.2s)]
*  Department backs me up on this, this is the professional view of the U.S. Justice Department, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=286.16s)]
*  Trump did no crimes. And that's how the whole Mueller report thing ended, right? I mean, it's over. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=290.48s)]
*  That's how Bill Barr broke the neck of the Mueller investigation in 2019. That's why even after Trump [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=298.08s)]
*  left office and he was just an ex-president and therefore he's no longer protected by that Justice [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=305.84s)]
*  Department policy that says you can't charge a sitting president, that's why there was no clamor [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=310.0s)]
*  to charge him then with any of the gazillion instances of alleged obstruction of justice that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=314.79999999999995s)]
*  were described in great detail in Mueller's report. It's because Barr said, he signed his name to it, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=320.79999999999995s)]
*  he said, we looked at everything here, regardless of that rule that says you can't charge him, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=327.36s)]
*  Trump definitely committed no crimes, he should not be charged. Barr's letter said, quote, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=331.6s)]
*  the evidence developed during the special counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=336.88s)]
*  the president committed an obstruction of justice offense. Our determination was made without regard [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=341.12s)]
*  to and is not based on the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  and criminal prosecution of a sitting president. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=350.8s)]
*  That's what Barr did. That's what Barr said. Turns out that was a lie. At least a federal appeals [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=356.88s)]
*  court in Washington has just ruled that that was a lie. According to a unanimous ruling from the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=362.56s)]
*  DC Circuit Court of Appeals, a three-judge panel, when Robert Mueller turned in his report to the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=368.72s)]
*  Justice Department, Attorney General Bill Barr and the Justice Department never actually considered [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=373.76s)]
*  at all whether or not Trump committed crimes or whether Trump should be charged. They literally [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=379.12s)]
*  never even looked at that possibility, despite what they said they were doing publicly. Barr lied, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  according to the appeals court, and told Congress and the public that the Justice [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=391.6s)]
*  Department did consider that. And after that careful consideration, they definitely concluded [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=395.76s)]
*  Trump committed no crimes and shouldn't be charged. But the appeals court says that Barr lied about it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=400.32s)]
*  This is from a, again, unanimous three-judge ruling from the federal appeals court in Washington, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=406.8s)]
*  DC. Quote, the department's submissions indicated that the memorandum conveyed advice about whether [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=411.84000000000003s)]
*  to charge President Trump with a crime. But the court's in-camera review of that memorandum revealed [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=418.8s)]
*  that the department, in fact, never considered bringing a charge. DOJ never, in fact, considered [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=424.64s)]
*  bringing any charges against Trump. They never even looked at it. We find out now. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=434.0s)]
*  Three years after the Mueller report came out, five years after most of the potentially criminal [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=441.6s)]
*  activity described in exquisite detail in that report, they said at the time they considered [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=447.2s)]
*  charges against him and no charges were warranted, but they never actually considered charges against [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=453.12s)]
*  him at all. They never once looked at it. So, you know, that happened. Okay. Apparently we just move [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=457.6s)]
*  on. Apparently we just move on because, you know, crimes in high places don't matter much, right? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  And, you know, if you're fully cognizant of the fact that you've gotten away with a bunch of crimes [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  without facing any charges or any consequences for those crimes, probably that has a really [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=481.52000000000004s)]
*  cautionary effect on you. So you never try any other potential crimes again, right? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=486.88s)]
*  I'm sure that's how it works. You think, whoa, close call. I better shape up. I'm sure that's how it works. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=491.2s)]
*  Joining us now for the interview is Dr. Anthony Fauci. He's director of the National Institute [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=502.16s)]
*  of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He's also chief medical advisor to President Biden, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=505.68s)]
*  which is a job that was created for him at the outset of this presidency. Dr. Fauci, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=509.68s)]
*  it's an honor to have you here tonight. Thank you. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=513.76s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Rachel. Good to be with you. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=517.6s)]
*  Why now? Why after all of these years, all of these presidents, all of these [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=521.12s)]
*  epidemics that you have searched through, why is now the time to go? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=527.76s)]
*  Well, you know, Rachel, it's never really a good time to leave, but you have to leave some time. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=533.68s)]
*  I have been wanting to pursue another chapter in my career, as you mentioned [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=539.52s)]
*  a bit ago, because I've been wanting to do things outside of the government, particularly [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=545.12s)]
*  to do things, be they lecture or write or get involved in situations where I can [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=550.4s)]
*  serve as hope and inspiration to encourage young people to go into public service, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=555.76s)]
*  particularly in the arena of science, medicine and public health. I was thinking of doing that [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=561.52s)]
*  right after the Trump administration ended. But when President Biden was elected, he very quickly [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=567.04s)]
*  asked me and I accepted with a great deal of honor to do that, to be his chief medical advisor. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=573.52s)]
*  I thought that was going to last one year because like so many other people, I thought [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  that the COVID outbreak would be over at the end of the first year of the Biden administration, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=586.48s)]
*  but obviously it's not. So having said that, some things look like they're starting to stabilize a [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=591.5200000000001s)]
*  bit. And I believe in the next few months, we will do better than we're doing now. I felt, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=597.12s)]
*  again, I might as well do it now because I want to make sure that when I do leave, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=602.4000000000001s)]
*  I still have the energy and the passion and the health to do the kind of things that I want to do. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=607.2s)]
*  So all things considered, Rachel, I thought it was the right time. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=612.96s)]
*  I just wonder if you can kind of just tell us in broad strokes, if you feel like in your part of [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=616.64s)]
*  the government and in public health and dealing with infectious diseases, we've gotten better over [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=624.32s)]
*  time. We've been learning the lessons learned and evolving and getting better at this. Or is this [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=629.0400000000001s)]
*  one of those situations in which our capacity has actually been eroding? And in some ways, we used to [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=634.08s)]
*  better resource these fights. We used to be better at handling the basics of how to deal with these [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=639.12s)]
*  challenges. I think it's a mixed bag, Rachel. I think in some respects, we have learned lessons [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=644.88s)]
*  from outbreaks in the past like HIV and Ebola and Zika and pandemic influenza and the challenges [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=652.8s)]
*  of the possibility of bird flu is turning into a pandemic. But in some respects, the situation has [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=660.88s)]
*  eroded. And I think it has in the sense of neglecting of the capabilities of the local [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=667.36s)]
*  public health officials. Because if you want to respond to an emerging infection, you do need [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=674.32s)]
*  leadership from above. You need central support from the government. But at the local level, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=681.04s)]
*  you also have to have the kind of resources that will allow you to respond. You know, when we learned [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=686.88s)]
*  and I hope we are still learning a very important lesson from COVID is that you never ever [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=693.68s)]
*  underestimate an emerging infection in which you don't know where it's going. Because we've been [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=701.12s)]
*  fooled before. We didn't fully appreciate the magnitude of HIV back in the early 80s when I [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=707.04s)]
*  first got involved when the first cases were recognized. And there were so many things we [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=714.3199999999999s)]
*  learned on the run with COVID. I mean, the things that we thought we knew in the beginning turned [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=720.48s)]
*  out as the months went by to not be the case, which really forced us to adapt and to change [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=727.28s)]
*  some of our policies and recommendations. That was interpreted by many as flip-flopping or [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=735.04s)]
*  not really knowing what's going on when it really was the evolution of the science. So one of the [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=741.28s)]
*  lessons that I hope we learn is that we've got to be prepared. We've got to be able to respond, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=746.8s)]
*  but we've also got to be flexible. You know, some of our military colleagues have told us it's kind [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=753.52s)]
*  of like when you're at a war, you can plan what you're going to do. But when the bullets go off [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=759.3599999999999s)]
*  and the cannon started firing, then it becomes the fog of war and you've got to be flexible enough to [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=765.5999999999999s)]
*  respond. I hope that that lesson has been learned and as we look forward to the inevitability [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=772.08s)]
*  of future outbreaks, we will not forget that lesson. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=779.44s)]
*  Are we facing an increased pace of threat from emerging infectious diseases? I mean, obviously [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=785.36s)]
*  the world-changing nature of the COVID pandemic is enough on its own, but you know, now also [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=792.88s)]
*  monkeypox and the re-emergence of polio and you know, in recent years it's Ebola and SARS and [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=798.96s)]
*  Zika and all these others. Is there an increased pace of threat from new and resurgent viruses [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=805.2s)]
*  or are we just sort of more aware of it with these recent ones? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=811.6800000000001s)]
*  No, it's not just more aware of it, Rachel. It is and there are probably a number of complex reasons [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=818.24s)]
*  why that's the case. If you look at the outbreaks that you just enumerated a moment ago, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=825.12s)]
*  it really follows a pattern that we've known for some time that about 70 to 75 percent of all the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=831.84s)]
*  new emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic. Namely, they jump from an animal species [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=838.96s)]
*  to a human. We saw that with HIV. We saw that with Ebola. We see that with monkeypox [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=846.32s)]
*  and we're seeing with this historic pandemic of COVID-19, which almost certainly evolved the way [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=853.52s)]
*  SARS-CoV-1 did from an animal reservoir such as a bat in the environment that jumps species. So [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=860.72s)]
*  if we really want to pay attention to how we can mitigate this, we have to pay much more attention [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=868.64s)]
*  to the animal-human interface and to what we are doing intentionally or inadvertently [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=875.2800000000001s)]
*  of perturbing that animal-human interface by encroaching upon rainforests, by getting involved [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=881.68s)]
*  in interfacing with animals such as in the wet markets which occur in China when you bring in [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=889.52s)]
*  animals where you don't have any idea what disease they're harboring and you put them in close touch [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=896.16s)]
*  with humans. I think that's one of the things we really better pay more attention to looking [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=902.24s)]
*  forward is attention to that animal-human interface. There have been a lot of theories [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=907.76s)]
*  and conspiracy theories and accusations and more or less wild claims about the origins of COVID in [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=916.56s)]
*  particular. It seems like that's when people on the political right really started getting their [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=923.12s)]
*  claws into you and targeting you personally during this pandemic. As I said, a visible and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=929.9200000000001s)]
*  singular leader on infectious disease issues over all these years, you've faced criticism, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=939.36s)]
*  sharp criticism before. It does feel a little different. There is a weird, obsessive, violent [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=945.36s)]
*  ongoing demonization of you by the right that is hinged on COVID. I just have to ask, from your [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=951.2800000000001s)]
*  perspective, if that kind of attention, that criticism, feels qualitatively different to you [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=957.52s)]
*  than previous criticism, if it is coming from a different place, if it is indeed more dangerous [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=962.64s)]
*  than the kind of criticism you've had in the past. Right. Rachel, it's phenomenally 100% different. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=967.68s)]
*  It's apples and elephants difference. It really is. Back in the day of HIV, and you showed some [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  of those clips, which were quite accurate, what we were doing in the federal government, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=984.8s)]
*  while we were being too rigid and restrictive in a disease that needed a great deal of flexibility [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  and input from the community, the AIDS activists that you saw on the clips that you showed, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=997.68s)]
*  when you examined what they were saying and what they were asking for, they were entirely correct. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1004.7199999999999s)]
*  So they opened our eyes, my eyes particularly, which made me actually turn into one of them, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1011.92s)]
*  an AIDS activist, because we learned from them, and we learned that we were being too rigid [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1019.04s)]
*  from a clinical trial standpoint and from a regulatory standpoint. And the FDA modernized [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1025.2s)]
*  their approach based on that too. What we're dealing with now is just a distortion of reality, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1031.84s)]
*  Rachel. I mean, conspiracy theories, which don't make any sense at all, pushing back on [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1040.8799999999999s)]
*  sound public health measures, you know, making it look like trying to save lives is encroaching on [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1047.6s)]
*  people's freedom. That's a big difference from the AIDS activists who really had a good foundation [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1055.6s)]
*  for their objections. Having been the target of this kind of really specific, really different [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1062.96s)]
*  attack, do you have insight into what we ought to do to protect public officials like yourself [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1069.2s)]
*  and to try to be more rational about this stuff as a country? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1075.2s)]
*  You know, Rachel, I wish I did have a positive, constructive answer for you, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1081.76s)]
*  but I don't. I think you and I are talking about public health issues right now, but what has [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1087.2s)]
*  spilled over and really in many respects impeded a proper response to a public health challenge [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1093.52s)]
*  is something that we see that goes well beyond public health. It's a complete distortion [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1101.36s)]
*  of reality. I mean, a world of where untruths have almost become normalized, how we can see something [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1107.76s)]
*  in front of our very eyes and deny it's happening. I mean, that's the environment we're living in. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1115.92s)]
*  You could look at January 6th on TV and you have some people who actually don't believe it happened. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1122.24s)]
*  How could that possibly be? And it's now spilling over in denial about public health principles. So, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1128.96s)]
*  I wish I had an answer, but I don't. I mean, I do have, as I've always been, someone who is [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1136.48s)]
*  cautiously optimistic and always feeling that we will be able to extract the good out of people, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1143.84s)]
*  and there are the possibility that we'll see, as I say, the better angels in our society prevail. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1149.68s)]
*  But what's going on out there now with the distortion of reality is very troublesome, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1156.88s)]
*  and I don't have an answer for it right now, but it certainly is interfering [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1162.16s)]
*  with the proper approach to a public health challenge. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1166.4s)]
*  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1169.2s)]
*  for the past 38 years, currently now the Chief Medical Advisor to President Biden for a few [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1176.08s)]
*  more months. Sir, thank you for a lifetime so far of service. I can't wait to see what you do next, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1180.1599999999999s)]
*  and thank you for being here to talk with us about it tonight. Thank you. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1187.84s)]
*  Thank you for having me. I appreciate it. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1193.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPThuNdWGJY&t=1206.08s)]
