# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 2
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno)
*  How's things going in Florida these days? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=0.0s)]
*  In addition to this rash of Nazi incidents, in addition to the Nazi incidents themselves, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  it's kind of a follow-on scandal that's now simmering in Florida involving Florida's Republican [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=11.0s)]
*  governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=16.06s)]
*  When the Nazi group showed up in central Florida on Saturday, right, screaming anti-Semitic [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=18.72s)]
*  abuse at people and beating up at least one Jewish passerby, and then the Nazis showed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=22.78s)]
*  up the following day and there's overpasses as well. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=29.06s)]
*  This was upsetting, right, in central Florida. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=31.9s)]
*  And local and state leaders, Democrat and Republican, they all rushed to condemn the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=33.74s)]
*  Nazis one by one. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=37.9s)]
*  The local mayor, the sheriff, members of Congress, Florida's Republican U.S. Senator Rick Scott, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=38.9s)]
*  they all volunteered themselves. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=43.78s)]
*  They all came forward and condemned the events in no uncertain terms. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=45.94s)]
*  But from the governor, it's been a little weird. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  The only initial response from Florida's Republican governor Ron DeSantis was this tweet from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=51.94s)]
*  his press secretary saying, quote, Do we even know if they are Nazis? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=56.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they volunteered that they are. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=61.54s)]
*  And also the swastika banners help with that. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=66.02s)]
*  She's since deleted that tweet. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=68.78s)]
*  You'll be happy to know that after that wobbly start to this little crisis, Governor DeSantis [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=71.78s)]
*  did finally get around to addressing the Nazis in Orlando issue. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=76.22s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=81.66s)]
*  Let's respond to the Nazi demonstration in Orlando over the weekend. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=82.66s)]
*  Why do you feel hatred is growing? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=88.38s)]
*  So what I'm going to say is these people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to stop that there for a second and say what I'm going to say is these people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=96.5s)]
*  You can sort of guess where he's going, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=101.66s)]
*  What I'm going to say is these people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=104.86s)]
*  What do you think he's going to say next, right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=107.58s)]
*  What I'm going to say is these people, these neo-Nazi hate groups, they have no place in [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=109.34s)]
*  our society, no place in Florida. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=113.3s)]
*  I condemn them in the strongest terms. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=114.86s)]
*  You figure that's what he's going to say, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  You figure that is where Florida's governor is going with that statement. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=118.86s)]
*  Because that is the easiest, most straightforward question an American politician can get, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=122.54s)]
*  Please respond to the Nazis. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=127.94s)]
*  That's like a long, slow softball right over the plate. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=130.46s)]
*  Are you ready? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=133.78s)]
*  There's only one right answer to that and you shouldn't have to memorize it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=134.78s)]
*  It's an easy one. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=137.46s)]
*  Please respond to the Nazis. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=138.58s)]
*  That's what Ronda Santos was asked and he starts off. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=143.3s)]
*  So what I'm going to say to these people, what do you think he says next? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=144.9s)]
*  Here's where he went with it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=150.5s)]
*  So what I'm going to say is these people, these Democrats who are trying to use this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=153.66000000000003s)]
*  as some type of political issue to try to smear me as if I had something to do with [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=158.58s)]
*  it, we're not playing their game. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=163.74s)]
*  We're not going to play their game of condemning Nazis because that's a Democrat game that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=167.54s)]
*  you don't want to get dragged into to muddy yourself. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=174.66s)]
*  I am not kidding when I tell you that Florida's governor, Ronda Santos, his answer continued [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=179.14s)]
*  for another two and a half minutes in which he talked about Joe Biden and inflation and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=183.44s)]
*  immigration and crime. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=188.88s)]
*  He even talked about Airbnb, but he never actually got around to condemning the Nazis. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=190.26s)]
*  Before 1980, there were two different Brigham hospitals in Boston that were both Harvard [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=197.06s)]
*  med school teaching hospitals. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  There was also the Boston Hospital for Women, which is kind of a weird concept, but that's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=204.66000000000003s)]
*  a thing that used to exist in medicine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=209.8s)]
*  In 1975, those three different Harvard Medical School teaching hospitals, they all merged [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=212.38s)]
*  and they got a new name. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=219.9s)]
*  They got the still awkward to this day name of Brigham and Women's. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  That is the name of the hospital. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=226.16s)]
*  It's a major teaching hospital. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=227.68s)]
*  As I said, it is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=229.34s)]
*  It's really prestigious. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  It's really accomplished. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  It's actually one of the most highly rated hospitals, not only in the United States. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  It's one of the most highly rated hospitals in the whole world. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=237.68s)]
*  And a week and a half ago at Brigham Women's Hospital in Boston, this happened. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=242.64s)]
*  They had an outbreak of Nazis. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=249.84s)]
*  This is a neo-Nazi group based in Worcester, Massachusetts. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=252.96s)]
*  We know that because they put their email address on the threatening flyer that the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=256.64s)]
*  group handed out at the hospital. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=260.16s)]
*  Hi ProtonMail, your servers are being used as contact information for literal Nazi recruitment [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=262.24s)]
*  efforts in the United States. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=267.7s)]
*  Did you know? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=269.08s)]
*  The Nazi group was out in front of Brigham and Women's Hospital. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=271.52s)]
*  A week ago Saturday, they handed out flyers targeting two doctors by name, accusing them [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=274.52s)]
*  of anti-white genocidal policy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=280.5s)]
*  And these guys lined up in their little khaki pants, in their little matching shirts and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=284.06s)]
*  their masks. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=289.34s)]
*  And they held up this big sign, Brigham and Women's Hospital kills whites. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=296.34s)]
*  The hospital kills whites, kills white people. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=298.62s)]
*  And so the Nazis are out there in front of the hospital on Saturday morning defending [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=301.82s)]
*  all the poor white people from the doctors in the hospitals that are trying to kill all [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=305.9s)]
*  the white people. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=310.06s)]
*  Why do the Nazis think that the hospitals are trying to kill the white people? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=312.02s)]
*  Where do they get this from? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=315.58s)]
*  Well, this happened exactly one week prior. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=317.66s)]
*  The left is now rationing life-saving therapeutics based on race, discriminating against and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=323.06s)]
*  denigrating, just denigrating white people to determine who lives and who dies. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=331.18s)]
*  If you're white, you don't get the vaccine or if you're white, you don't get therapeutics. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=337.9s)]
*  If you're white, you have to go to the back of the line to get medical help. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=347.73999999999995s)]
*  If you're white, you go right to the back of the line. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=348.73999999999995s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=351.26s)]
*  If you're white, you go right to the back of the line. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=352.26s)]
*  That was Trump speaking Saturday the 15th. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=355.85999999999996s)]
*  It was Saturday the 22nd. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  Exactly one week later, there's the Nazis outside the hospital in Boston with their big sign. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=360.26s)]
*  This hospital kills white people. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=365.9s)]
*  They're so pleased with themselves, they posted like a travelogue of themselves all taking [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=369.06s)]
*  the tea in Boston, wearing their little Nazi outfits and handing out their Nazi flyers [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=373.23999999999995s)]
*  to people on the platform waiting for their train. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=377.34s)]
*  The whole group of them throwing their little Heil Hitler's Nazi salutes on public transportation, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=380.41999999999996s)]
*  doing the white power hand gesture thing. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=385.73999999999995s)]
*  Oh wait, more Nazi salutes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=388.14s)]
*  Never get tired of that one. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=390.38s)]
*  This is Massachusetts last weekend. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=393.14s)]
*  We're having a problem with this as a country right now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=396.46s)]
*  How are we dealing with it? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=399.5s)]
*  Part of the way we are dealing with it is by good investigative reporting. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=402.26s)]
*  Joining us now is Philip Martin. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=406.02s)]
*  He is a senior investigative reporter for GBH News, which is an NPR station in Boston. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=407.46s)]
*  Mr. Martin, it's a pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=411.5s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=413.62s)]
*  Rachel, thank you. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=414.62s)]
*  Much appreciated. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=415.62s)]
*  Let me just ask if there's anything else that you've been able to report out about this [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=417.1s)]
*  disturbing demonstration, this group that showed up at the hospital in Boston. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=423.22s)]
*  Is there anything that you can tell us about the size of this group, the other kind of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=427.46s)]
*  stuff that they've been doing? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=431.34000000000003s)]
*  We can talk about the size to some degree. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=433.66s)]
*  Your summary, by the way, was excellent. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=436.22s)]
*  The size, this has always been a minute and fringe organization, but right now they're [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=438.22s)]
*  part of what you see as a trend, the mainstreaming of extremism. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=444.62s)]
*  This is a French group that has suddenly attracted new members. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=449.3s)]
*  We know that because the Anti-Defamation League of New England has been counting them and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=453.48s)]
*  said that the demonstration outside of the Brigham and Women's Hospital that you pointed [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=458.48s)]
*  out was larger than most of their demonstrations. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=464.02s)]
*  On most occasions, they might attract four or five people. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=467.3s)]
*  This time they've attracted about two dozen people. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=470.9s)]
*  So, the size of this group is still small when we talk about organizations. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=474.1s)]
*  But as far as an extreme right neo-Nazi organization, it's considered significant. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=478.54s)]
*  One of the things that I thought was really interesting about your reporting, Philip, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=485.54s)]
*  was to contextualize this over time. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=489.54s)]
*  This is not the first time these doctors have been targeted, including by name. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=493.54s)]
*  And in this case, it was very disturbing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=498.54s)]
*  They have their photos distributed, right, at their place of work. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=499.54s)]
*  And it's also not the same time the hospital has been targeted. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=503.22s)]
*  I was really interested to have you put that in context in terms of the kinds of scholarly work they've done. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=505.22s)]
*  Some of the pioneering research those doctors took part in was about heart failure. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=510.22s)]
*  Patients in the hospital with heart failure have better outcomes when they're put on the cardiology unit rather than being treated in general medicine. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=517.22s)]
*  These doctors were among a research team that found that, all things being equal, black and Latino patients with heart failure were less likely to be put in the cardiology unit. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=524.22s)]
*  And that's where you get better outcomes. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=532.9s)]
*  It was a really specific kind of racial health disparity that they identified, that they proved, and that they've since been trying to fix. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=534.9s)]
*  I just want to make sure that I understand that right. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=542.9s)]
*  That's the first time I had known about the link between those doctors and that research in your reporting. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=545.9s)]
*  And is that part of the way they're being targeted for that kind of work? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=550.9s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=554.9s)]
*  What you and many others, most people would call sort of striving for equity and equality in medicine, trying to get past the legacy of what Harriet Washington called medical apartheid, trying to create justice within the medical field. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=556.5799999999999s)]
*  They identified a specific problem that is, as you pointed out, that black, Latino, Latino patients were not receiving the same quality of care. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=578.26s)]
*  And therefore, they wanted to level the playing field within the hospital system. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=589.26s)]
*  That has been described by neo-Nazis who are essentially echoing others such as Donald Trump, I'm afraid. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=596.26s)]
*  That has been described as preferential treatment and anti-white. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=605.9399999999999s)]
*  They are indeed echoing a sentiment that is widespread on social media, where the minute you mention equity in the context of medicine and many other things for that matter, it's construed as anti-white. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=609.9399999999999s)]
*  It's a very insidious type of propaganda that we're hearing right now that years ago would be considered fringe. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=626.62s)]
*  And it's now, it has now seeped, not seeped, it's flooded into the mainstream. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=635.62s)]
*  And that's what we're dealing with right now, Rachel. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=640.62s)]
*  Mr. Martin, I'm sort of trying to put this in context a little bit in terms of the medical community in Boston. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=643.62s)]
*  Because Boston has a big, powerful health care community. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=651.3s)]
*  It is some of the best hospitals in the world. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=655.3s)]
*  They do attract medical talent from all over the world. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=657.3s)]
*  Now that this harassment and targeted harassment of individual doctors and to a certain degree individual hospitals has reached this level of scary and frankly, to my eyes, disgusting levels. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=660.3s)]
*  Is there any sign that these doctors who have been personally targeted and terrorized like this and the hospital too, are they getting support? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=676.9799999999999s)]
*  Are they getting backup from the broader and as I say, powerful, influential medical community in Boston and around New England? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=683.9799999999999s)]
*  To a large degree, yes. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=693.9799999999999s)]
*  The American Medical Association, for example, the AMA, traditionally a very conservative organization, not always known for being within the racial progress vanguard, if you will. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=696.66s)]
*  Their led, their equity efforts are led by a doctor who has done quite a bit. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=707.66s)]
*  They have been working tirelessly to basically create equity as the chief equity officer for the American Medical Association. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=716.3399999999999s)]
*  They introduced a plan to attack structural racism within the medical field and particularly within the AMA. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=727.3399999999999s)]
*  And these doctors in Boston also receiving support from fellow doctors within the teaching hospitals, but specifically at Harvard Medical School. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=737.02s)]
*  Perhaps not as robust as it should be, and they're working on that. They recognize that there are internal problems within the organization and they're basically zeroing in on that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=748.02s)]
*  It's the reason also why this report today, the GBH report that you referenced, we focus, yes, at the top on the neo-Nazis demonstrating and threatening these doctors. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=759.6999999999999s)]
*  But we also zero in on their research. Very important. And that research is in fact receiving support around the country of doctors like Manisha Sharma in California. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=772.6999999999999s)]
*  And equity networks of various sorts, equal access, various grassroots and progressive organizations that are targeting the causes of inequality and injustice within the medical field. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=786.38s)]
*  Yeah, part of it is being targeted and getting back up and getting defense when that happens. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=801.38s)]
*  But part of it is sticking to your guns and not being intimidated out of doing this work, no matter what anybody else tries to make it into. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=806.38s)]
*  Thank you, Philip Martin, Senior Investigative Reporter for GBH News in Boston. Mr. Martin, thank you for your work and thank you for helping us understand it tonight. I appreciate it, sir. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=813.06s)]
*  Great, Troy. Thank you. Thank you for having me on. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=820.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=823.06s)]
*  We've got some interesting breaking news tonight from the New York Times on a story that we've been covering here aggressively over the last few weeks. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=824.06s)]
*  It's the story of Republicans in a number of states forging paperwork to try to cast fake votes in the Electoral College for Donald Trump. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=831.06s)]
*  You can see in the headline here on the story that broke just as we were getting on the air, memos show roots of Trump's focus on January 6th and alternate electors. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=840.7399999999999s)]
*  Here's the lead, quote, 15 days after Election Day in 2020, a lawyer for the Trump campaign in Wisconsin received a memo setting out what became the rationale for an audacious strategy to put in place alternate slates of electors and slates where Trump was trying to overturn his loss. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=847.7399999999999s)]
*  The memo may not have been the first time that lawyers and allies of Trump had weighed the possibility of naming their own electors in the hopes they might eventually succeed in flipping the outcome in battleground states through recounts and lawsuits baselessly asserting widespread fraud. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=864.42s)]
*  But the November 18 memo, again, 15 days after the election, the November 18 memo and another one three weeks later, they are among the earliest known efforts to put on paper proposals for preparing alternate electors. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=881.0999999999999s)]
*  The memos helped to shape a crucial strategy that Trump embraced with profound consequences for himself and the nation. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=895.0999999999999s)]
*  So we have been covering for weeks now on the show the evolving understanding of this scheme by Trump and friends to falsify the election results and try to keep Trump in power, even though he lost. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=902.78s)]
*  And part of that is this thing that is emerging with more and more clarity all the time. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=913.78s)]
*  Part of the scheme was to send fake slates of electors to Congress. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=918.78s)]
*  Pro Trump Republicans in at least five states that Biden won, they got together and created and signed forged fraudulent certificates declaring themselves to be the real true presidential electors for their states. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=924.4599999999999s)]
*  That was in five states and two other states Republicans created and sent these certificates in, but they included language saying they were just a backup in case Trump prevailed in his lawsuits to try to overturn the election. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=937.4599999999999s)]
*  But five of them just said, we're the real electors when they really weren't the real electors. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=949.14s)]
*  Now, they didn't keep it secret that they were doing this at the time, but these gatherings and these documents were largely written off as a sort of, you know, kooky Trump supporters engaging in, you know, wish fulfillment fantasies or at least just shenanigans. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=956.14s)]
*  Wasn't until a few weeks ago that we started to understand that in fact this was a serious and coordinated effort across many states. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=969.8199999999999s)]
*  The Trump campaign coordinated the effort in order to get these fraudulent slates of electors in front of Vice President Mike Pence on January 6th as part of an effort to pressure Mike Pence to use the fake Trump elector slates to count the fake electors instead of the real ones. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=976.8199999999999s)]
*  To overturn Biden's election and declare that Trump had won. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=990.5s)]
*  So we knew that it happened at the time. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=993.5s)]
*  We didn't understand that it was coordinated or how it fit into a larger, more serious scheme, but that has been evolving over the past few weeks. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=996.5s)]
*  All the while, the sort of origins of the scheme. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1001.5s)]
*  Who came up with the idea how it was communicated? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1004.5s)]
*  And how did it work? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1007.5s)]
*  And how did it work? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1010.5s)]
*  All the while, the sort of origins of the scheme. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1014.18s)]
*  Who came up with the idea how it was communicated to the people on the ground, to these Republicans who gathered and forged these documents and then got them to the right places at the right time? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1017.18s)]
*  The sort of command and control of this conspiracy has all been a little murky. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1026.18s)]
*  These new memos published tonight by the New York Times shed some light on that murk. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1031.18s)]
*  They shed some light on how this all came together. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1036.18s)]
*  Again, that first memo from November 18th is 15 days after the election. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1038.8600000000001s)]
*  It's a memo written to a Trump campaign lawyer in Wisconsin from another lawyer he apparently had consulted for advice. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1041.8600000000001s)]
*  That first memo essentially lays the groundwork for the scheme. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1048.8600000000001s)]
*  It says the date we need to be focused on is January 6th. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1051.8600000000001s)]
*  That's our last chance to overturn Biden's win in Wisconsin. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1054.8600000000001s)]
*  But if we're going to do that, a slate of Trump electors from Wisconsin needs to meet on December 14th in the Wisconsin state Capitol. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1057.8600000000001s)]
*  And they need to cast their supposed votes for Trump because that's what the law would require real electors to do had Trump won if their electoral college votes were going to be seen as valid. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1067.54s)]
*  So that's the memo that happens 15 days after the election, November 18th. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1078.54s)]
*  Then there's a second memo three weeks later between the same two lawyers that lays out not just what the Trump electors, the fake Trump electors in Wisconsin would have to do, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1082.54s)]
*  but what they would have to do in several states that Biden won that Trump was trying to nevertheless overturn. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1092.22s)]
*  This was less than a week before December 14th, which is the date where presidential electors do have to cast their votes. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1099.22s)]
*  That second memo laid out in detail what the fake Trump electors would have to do in each state step by step in order to have their forgeries appear valid and pseudo legal under the law. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1106.22s)]
*  We learn from this second memo why perhaps so many of the fake electors were so insistent on getting inside state capitals. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1119.9s)]
*  Remember those fake Trump electors in Michigan pounding on the door and trying to talk their way past the state police because they wanted to get inside the state Capitol building. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1125.9s)]
*  They were insisting they were the real electors. They had to get inside. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1133.9s)]
*  Well, apparently in Michigan and in several other states, electors are required to cast their votes inside the Capitol in order to be considered valid. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1136.9s)]
*  In Michigan, they did not get in. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1145.5800000000002s)]
*  But in other states, they did. The Trump campaign was reportedly involved in booking space inside state capitals for these groups of fake electors. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1147.5800000000002s)]
*  That second memo, the December 9th memo, also lays out exactly how the certificates needed to be signed, where the certificates needed to be sent to the National Archives, to the Senate. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1155.5800000000002s)]
*  And that may explain why all those electors knew exactly what their certificates should look like and where they should sign and where they needed to send them. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1165.5800000000002s)]
*  Somebody gave them all the same advice for exactly how to do this. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1173.26s)]
*  It seems like every time we think we know just how advanced and serious the planning for this part of the plot was, new evidence emerges that shows the plot to have been even closer to being realized than we thought [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1178.26s)]
*  and more tightly connected to the former president in his campaign than we previously might have imagined. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1190.26s)]
*  Thank you for watching! [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7bhaZQTGno&t=1202.58s)]
