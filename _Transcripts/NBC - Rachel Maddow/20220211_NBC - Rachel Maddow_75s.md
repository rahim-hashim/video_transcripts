# Biden Supreme Court Short List Down To Three Candidates: NBC News
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgg9wb8dxfA)
*  President Biden is spending the weekend at Camp David where he will not only have a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow, he'll also spend the weekend reviewing materials about his short list of Supreme Court contenders to replace retiring justice Stephen Breyer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgg9wb8dxfA&t=0.0s)]
*  Things seem to be moving fast on that front. Last night, President Biden told NBC's Lester Holt in an interview that he's taken a deep dive on about four people. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgg9wb8dxfA&t=14.0s)]
*  Today, several sources are telling NBC News the list is down to three women, judges Katanji Brown Jackson, Michelle Childs, and Leondra Krueger. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgg9wb8dxfA&t=23.0s)]
*  As you know, the president promised to name a black woman to the job. The White House also weighed in about a dispute about one of those candidates today, Judge Katanji Brown Jackson, thereby officially confirming that she's on the short list. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgg9wb8dxfA&t=32.0s)]
*  The clock is ticking. Democrats want the interview process to begin as early as next week and the name of the final contender by the end of the month. We shall see. As Rachel says, watch this space. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgg9wb8dxfA&t=44.0s)]
