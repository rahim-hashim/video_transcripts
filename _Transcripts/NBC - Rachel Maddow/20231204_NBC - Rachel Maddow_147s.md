# 'Dangerous and chilling': Cheney describes the moment she learned Trump's 2020 scheme
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg)
*  Let me ask you about a moment in your book that happens on January 4th. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=0.0s)]
*  That's described in chapter 9 of your book, and you describe listening in on a call [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=5.04s)]
*  in which Trump lawyers are briefing what we call surrogates. Basically, people are going to go on [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=9.84s)]
*  TV and talk about the pro-Trump side of things. And on that call, Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=14.64s)]
*  describes what they're envisioning for January 6th. She says, the way you write it is, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=19.68s)]
*  in the scenario Ellis described, when Pence was presiding, he could either refuse to open [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=23.84s)]
*  or refuse to count the electoral votes. So they don't necessarily know you're on this call. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=28.64s)]
*  You're listening in. It's two days before January 6th. Was that the moment when it really became [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=34.08s)]
*  clear to you in detail what they were going to try to do? Yes. You know, I had heard, obviously, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  there had been talk about we're going to have these electors meet. I think Stephen [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  Miller had been talking about that. But it wasn't clear to me what the contours of this particular [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=50.72s)]
*  part of the plan were until I dialed into that phone call and listening to them describe how [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=57.36s)]
*  these fake electors were going to be used. And the fact that they anticipated that Vice President [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Pence was going to use them to refuse to count the legitimate electors was certainly a moment of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=71.28s)]
*  intense concern. And as I got off that call, I ran into the Capitol, into the office of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=78.8s)]
*  parliamentarian of the House to say, you know, wait a minute, this is what I'm hearing is going [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=85.6s)]
*  to happen. What do we do about it in the joint session? How do we stop this? And it was very [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=90.32s)]
*  clear that there were not a lot of good answers to that because I knew, I learned later through [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=95.84s)]
*  the investigation that Vice President Pence and his counsel were having discussions with the Senate [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  parliamentarian and that the Vice President, you know, ultimately, of course, did his duty bravely. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=111.36s)]
*  But if you're in a joint session of Congress, you know, you're not in a position where there [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=111.76s)]
*  are a lot of legislative steps that you can take except to basically, you know, move to adjourn. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=117.76s)]
*  So it was a very dangerous and chilling moment. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7yIduEsfzg&t=124.08s)]
