# New reporting on Musk's minions makes his government takeover team look even worse
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY)
*  We also got this delightful advance in this story from The Wall Street Journal, which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=0.0s)]
*  exclusively reported that the actual kid, the actual person who Donald Trump and Elon [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=6.88s)]
*  Musk had let into the Treasury payment system, the actual person is this person. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=14.4s)]
*  Quote, a key Doge staff member who gained access to the Treasury Department's central [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=21.44s)]
*  payment system resigned today after he was linked to a deleted social media account that [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=28.4s)]
*  advocated racism and eugenics. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  A 25-year-old who was part of a cadre of Elon Musk lieutenants deployed by Doge to scrutinize [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  federal spending resigned after The Wall Street Journal asked the White House about his connection [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=43.22s)]
*  to the account. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=48.32s)]
*  The account posted in July, quote, just for the record, I was racist before it was cool. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=50.16s)]
*  The account wrote on Twitter in September, quote, you could not pay me to marry outside [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=56.34s)]
*  of my ethnicity. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=61.7s)]
*  In reference to a post noting the prevalence of people from India in Silicon Valley, the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=65.22s)]
*  account wrote, again in September, quote, normalize Indian hate. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=69.94s)]
*  After The Wall Street Journal inquired about the account, White House spokesperson Caroline [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=78.10000000000001s)]
*  Levitt said that the young man had resigned from his role. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=81.76s)]
*  Again, this is one of the Elon Musk lieutenants, one of his, like, bad news bears, who specifically [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  was allowed access to the most sensitive payment system in the entire U.S. government, the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=95.68s)]
*  one that sends out more than 90 percent of all payments for all things from the United [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  States Treasury. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=107.24000000000001s)]
*  This was that specific kid. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  And here's my favorite part of this reporting from The Wall Street Journal. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=110.4s)]
*  After The Wall Street Journal uncovers what this kid has said, I was racist before it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=113.64s)]
*  was cool, you could not pay me to marry outside my ethnicity, normalize Indian hate, after [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal turns up that stuff from this kid, the journal then does—there's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  then an interview, excuse me, with Bloomberg, in which Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=132.24s)]
*  quote, defended the work of Doge employees appended to the Treasury Department, describing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=138.88s)]
*  them as, quote, highly trained professionals. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=143.56s)]
*  That's why he gave them access to the most sensitive payment system in the entire U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  government that partisan political actors have never had access to before in the history [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=153.0s)]
*  of this country. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=157.12s)]

*  professionals that are very trusted by the U.S. Treasury Secretary. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=175.24s)]
*  Just from Wired.com tonight, quote, a young technologist known online as Big Balls, who [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=180.96s)]
*  Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, has access to sensitive [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=190.6s)]
*  U.S. government systems. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=195.48s)]
*  Highly trained professionals. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=198.28s)]
*  However, his professional and online history call into question whether he would pass the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  background check typically required to obtain security clearances, according to security [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=204.57999999999998s)]

*  of web domains, including at least two that are registered in Russia. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=218.04s)]
*  One of those domains, which is still active, offers a service called healthy, which is [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  an AI bot for discord servers targeting the Russian market. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  Someone using a telegram handle linked to the young man also solicited a cyber attack [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  for hire service in 2022. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=237.32s)]

*  So these are these are the highly trained professionals. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=265.04s)]
*  That was the exact phrase from Trump Treasury Secretary Scott Besson. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-BdI2WQPLY&t=269.92s)]
