# Mishandling Of Documents 'Clearest Case Against Trump' Says David Rohde
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40)
*  Joining us now is David Rode. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=1.84s)]
*  He's now executive editor for the NewYorker.com. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=3.44s)]
*  David, thanks for making time to be here tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=5.96s)]
*  I was really glad when I heard that you [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=7.84s)]
*  might be able to join us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=9.28s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=11.44s)]
*  So you've had great sourcing inside the Justice Department [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=13.68s)]
*  over the last few years. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=17.16s)]
*  And I just wanted to ask if any of your reporting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=18.12s)]
*  in recent months and recent weeks on this classified [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=23.0s)]
*  documents investigation suggested [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=25.84s)]
*  that it was leading toward some dramatic action, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=28.72s)]
*  like this FBI raid today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=30.84s)]
*  Is it your sense from your reporting [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=34.32s)]
*  that this investigation is very serious, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=36.04s)]
*  that this action today is some indication about where [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=39.12s)]
*  the investigation might be going? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  So the raid is a surprise to me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=43.72s)]
*  But a government investigator told me [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=45.96s)]
*  that they felt that the clearest case against Donald Trump [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  was this mishandling of documents, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  that it was 15 boxes, as Jackie Elamani explained earlier, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  that Trump was warned to not take these documents. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=58.34s)]
*  If you remember, and ironically, this is the same type [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=62.14s)]
*  of investigation that Hillary Clinton faced, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=64.82000000000001s)]
*  was she intentionally mishandling [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=66.86s)]
*  classified information? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=69.98s)]
*  And the sense I have is that the case against Trump [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  for intentionally mishandling classified information [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=74.98s)]
*  is even stronger than the case against Hillary Clinton, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=78.42s)]
*  because he was told to not take these records, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  but he took them to Florida. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  So I think that is the focus of the search, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=85.58s)]
*  and that is the most likely, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=89.98s)]
*  if there is gonna be a criminal charge, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=91.74s)]
*  that appears to be the clearest one. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=93.22s)]
*  And David, just as a follow to that, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=95.98s)]
*  is it your sense that them pursuing this information [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  with a search warrant rather than just sending a subpoena, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=101.58s)]
*  telling Trump that he needs to collect these documents [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=104.58s)]
*  and send them in, indicates a certain level of urgency [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=106.7s)]
*  or aggressiveness in terms of how fast they're moving [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=109.98s)]
*  and how they're approaching this? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=113.22s)]
*  It's very aggressive. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=116.22s)]
*  There is a sense of urgency. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=117.06s)]
*  There's evidence every day that he's destroying documents, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  pictures of documents and toilets [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=120.61999999999999s)]
*  that came out this morning. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=122.38s)]
*  This is an incredibly serious step. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=124.06s)]
*  I believe that Merrick Garland approved this himself. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=127.02s)]
*  He will be investigated by Kevin McCarthy, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=130.29999999999998s)]
*  as you said earlier. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=132.3s)]
*  So we are entering a new and very dangerous stage, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=133.7s)]
*  but all the Justice Department people I've been speaking to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=136.66s)]
*  for a book I've been working on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=139.18s)]
*  say they're being incredibly careful [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=140.78s)]
*  that they would only act [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=142.74s)]
*  if there was crystal clear evidence. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  They don't wanna be political. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=146.10000000000002s)]
*  This is gonna be perceived as political [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=148.02s)]
*  by half the country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=149.78s)]
*  So it's a monumental development [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=151.34s)]
*  and we'll see if their evidence holds up in court, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=154.34s)]
*  but it's just a shocking series of events tonight. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a13oO5OCj40&t=157.42000000000002s)]
