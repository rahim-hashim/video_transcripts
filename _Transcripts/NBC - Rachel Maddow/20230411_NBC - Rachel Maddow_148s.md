# Washington state comes to aid of women endangered by Idaho's radical anti-abortion laws
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs)
*  In Idaho, also consider that Republicans just passed a law late last week that threatens you with two to five years in prison if you help someone under the age of 18 leave the state to get an abortion. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=0.0s)]
*  You have to leave the state of Idaho if you want to get an abortion because they have criminalized abortion there. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=12.0s)]
*  But helping someone do so now is a new crime. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=17.0s)]
*  They're calling it abortion trafficking. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=20.0s)]
*  And it's two to five years in prison. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=22.0s)]
*  You would think in the United States of America that a state couldn't pass a law banning you as an American from traveling to another state. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=25.0s)]
*  But that's the Idaho Republican idea of freedom now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=34.0s)]
*  They are also going to try to use the law to bring criminal charges against doctors who provide an abortion in another state. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=37.0s)]
*  If that abortion is provided to a young woman who has traveled there from Idaho. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=45.0s)]
*  Now, one of the states that has a long border with Idaho is Washington state where abortion is legal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=49.0s)]
*  That state's Democratic governor Jay Inslee wrote a letter just a few days ago to Idaho's Republican governor Brad Little. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=54.0s)]
*  It's Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor from Washington on the left side of your screen there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=61.0s)]
*  It's Brad Little, the Republican governor of Idaho on the right side of your screen. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=64.0s)]
*  Jay Inslee's letter to Brad Little basically for most of the letter tells him just what a bad thing to do. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=69.0s)]
*  It is for Idaho to pass this new law. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=75.0s)]
*  But then Governor Inslee says to him at the end of the letter this he says, quote, We welcome Idaho's patients and health care providers with open arms here in Washington. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=78.0s)]
*  But make no mistake, Governor Little, the laws of another state that seek to punish anyone in Washington for lawful actions taken in Washington will not stand. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=88.0s)]
*  Quote, We will protect our providers and we will harbor and comfort your residents who seek health care services that are denied to them in Idaho. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=98.0s)]
*  We will harbor and comfort your people who need to flee your state in order to get care here. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=108.0s)]
*  And you will not be arresting our doctors and nurses and pharmacists, my friend. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=115.0s)]
*  Radical turn. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=120.0s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nOtHFL4rs&t=123.0s)]
