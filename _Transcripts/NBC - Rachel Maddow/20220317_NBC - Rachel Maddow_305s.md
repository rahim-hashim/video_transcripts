# Estimated Russian Casualties Put Ukraine War In Category Of Catastrophe
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c)
*  It was only a few decades ago that Russian forces were right here in Budapest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=0.0s)]
*  In 1956, when Hungary was under the control of the Soviet Union, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=6.0s)]
*  Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest to put down a democratic revolution in this city. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=10.48s)]
*  The crackdown was successful, and it was brutal. Some 25,000 Hungarians and 700 Soviet soldiers [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=16.48s)]
*  were killed. Nearly a quarter million Hungarians fled the country. That whole thing was over in a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=25.44s)]
*  week, and Hungary's democratic aspirations would have to wait until the fall of the Soviet Union [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=31.28s)]
*  more than 30 years later. But not all Soviet military interventions were that short or [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=36.64s)]
*  successful. Most famously, the Soviet tanks rolled into Afghanistan in 1979 and ended up bogged down [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=43.28s)]
*  there for a decade. The war was a disaster for Afghanistan, where something like two million [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=51.68s)]
*  Afghan civilians were killed, but it was a debacle for the Soviet military. They lost nearly 15,000 [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=57.84s)]
*  Soviet troops over 10 years and ultimately had to give up and retreat. The Soviet Union itself [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=65.2s)]
*  collapsed just two years later, in part because of the unpopularity and cost of that war. And so [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=71.12s)]
*  here is something worth considering. If that, Afghanistan, was a military catastrophe, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=77.76s)]
*  a humiliating defeat that contributed to the fall of a global superpower, 15,000 soldiers killed over [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=83.92s)]
*  a decade, what would we call an invasion in which Russia has lost half that number in just three [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=90.72s)]
*  weeks? Because that is what American intelligence officials say has happened, according to new [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  reporting by the New York Times. More than 7,000 Russian troops killed in Ukraine since the invasion [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=104.24s)]
*  began, and that, they say, is a conservative estimate. Now, if those American intelligence [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=111.2s)]
*  estimates are accurate, and of course we have no way of independently verifying them, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=117.44s)]
*  that would be a staggering number of casualties for Russian forces to have sustained in three weeks. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  7,000 is the number of Marines killed in 36 days of fighting on Iwo Jima, one of the fiercest battles [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=129.04s)]
*  of World War II. 7,000 is greater than the number of American troops killed over 20 years in Iraq [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=135.6s)]
*  and Afghanistan combined. And it's not just the casualty numbers that point to a Russian army in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=142.64s)]
*  disarray. Today, a British military intelligence assessment echoed what American defense officials [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=148.88s)]
*  have been saying, that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has largely stalled on all fronts as they [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=154.24s)]
*  fend off constant Ukrainian counterattacks. Four Russian generals have reportedly been killed in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=160.16s)]
*  the fighting. Western officials say the generals may be pushing closer to the front lines to try [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=166.24s)]
*  and boost flagging morale among the Russian troops, making them more vulnerable to attack themselves. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=171.12s)]
*  The New York Times reports, quote, two American military officials said that many Russian generals [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=177.12s)]
*  are talking on unsecured phones and radios. In at least one instance, they said, the Ukrainians [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=181.92s)]
*  intercepted a general's call, geo located it, and attacked his location, killing him and his staff, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=187.92s)]
*  end quote. And then there's Russia's loss of costly military hardware. The Wall Street Journal [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  has this report, headline Ukraine has become a graveyard for Russian tanks, with analysts [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=200.16s)]
*  saying that this is likely the highest number of tanks destroyed in such a short period since World [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=204.88s)]
*  War II. Now, all of this bad news is having repercussions back in Moscow. Russian news sources [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=211.2s)]
*  have reported that Vladimir Putin has put two of his top intelligence officials under house arrest. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=216.48s)]
*  A Russian security services expert tells the Times that the two men were interrogated for providing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=222.32s)]
*  poor intelligence ahead of the invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Russian military is reporting [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=227.6s)]
*  so reportedly so desperate for new soldiers that recruiters are targeting and pressuring [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=233.12s)]
*  central Asian immigrants who are working in Russia, basically telling them if they want [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=238.72s)]
*  Russian citizenship, they need to sign up to go fight in Ukraine. That reporting is from the Moscow [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=243.28s)]
*  Times, an independent Russian newspaper that as of last week is now operating out of Amsterdam [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=249.68s)]
*  because of the Kremlin's media crackdown. Russia's military troubles were the theme of a new video [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=255.04s)]
*  message tonight from Ukrainian President Zelensky. He claimed that Ukrainian forces have killed [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=260.0s)]
*  13,000 Russian soldiers and taken thousands of prisoners. Speaking in Russian, he addressed the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=265.12s)]
*  mothers of the Russian soldiers, telling them that Ukraine never wanted all these dead bodies [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=271.2s)]
*  and prisoners, quote, We did not want this war. All we want is peace and for you to love your [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=276.24s)]
*  children more than you are afraid of your government. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=281.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRfblwK-M-c&t=295.12s)]
