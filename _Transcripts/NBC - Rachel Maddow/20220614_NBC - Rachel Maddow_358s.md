# Fascist, Paramilitary Groups Seen Aligning With Republican Political Targeting
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM)
*  Ah, another cooperator. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=0.0s)]
*  Today, another member of the pro-Trump, right-wing paramilitary group, the Proud Boys, pled guilty [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=2.64s)]
*  for his role in the January 6th attack and also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=9.16s)]
*  This makes three now, three members of the so-called Proud Boys who've pled guilty. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=13.42s)]
*  One of those who's cooperating is cooperating in the seditious conspiracy case the Justice [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=18.68s)]
*  Department has brought against the group. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=22.62s)]
*  There's also a seditious conspiracy case pending against the members of another proto-fascist [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=24.64s)]
*  pro-Trump paramilitary group called the Oath Keepers. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  Seditious conspiracy is a specific, rarely charged, very serious crime that the Justice [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=34.2s)]
*  Department has had a heck of a time in previous cases proving it, the very few times it's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=39.96s)]
*  ever been used in the U.S. criminal law. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  But one of the things we are learning from the indictments and from the court filings [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=48.8s)]
*  in those sedition cases and in the public hearings by the January 6th investigation [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  is that these paramilitary groups were apparently an important integral part of the plot to [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=58.72s)]
*  try to overthrow the government, to stop the certification of the last election by using [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=63.36s)]
*  force inside the U.S. Capitol. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=68.84s)]
*  The January 6th investigators have laid out how hundreds of these Proud Boys marched to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=71.4s)]
*  the Capitol hours before Trump directed the crowd at his rally that they should go to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=76.76s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=81.68s)]
*  They started attacking police just as Trump started sending the big mob their way. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=82.68s)]
*  They were effectively the tip of the spear. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=87.48s)]
*  They breached the Capitol and then the mob was there to roll in behind them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=90.08s)]
*  The chairman of the January 6th investigation says at upcoming hearings, witnesses will [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  describe conversations between these paramilitary groups that led the breach of the Capitol [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=98.4s)]
*  and people in the orbit of then President Trump. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=103.92s)]
*  They're charged with sedition. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=107.4s)]
*  And then there's him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  These aren't the only fascist right-wing paramilitary groups that are operating on [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  the bleeding edge of right-wing politics right now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=119.0s)]
*  Just this past weekend, for example, there was this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=122.2s)]
*  These guys stopped at U-Haul full of dudes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=126.32s)]
*  A swarm of extremists who Idaho police say came to riot. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=129.68s)]
*  31 suspected white nationalists zip-tied and arrested, blocks from a Pride festival. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=133.44s)]
*  There was at least one smoke grenade. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=138.96s)]
*  There was multiple shields. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=141.68s)]
*  Coeur d'Alene police Saturday discovered the crowd crammed in a U-Haul after a 911 caller [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=143.52s)]
*  described seeing a little army at a local hotel with masks on their faces and slogans [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=148.12s)]
*  like Reclaim America on their shirts. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=153.24s)]
*  Police charging all 31 with conspiracy to riot, noting they planned to swarm several parts [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=156.08s)]
*  of Coeur d'Alene and carried paperwork similar to an operations plan that a police or military [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  group would put together. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  They traveled in from states all across the country, allegedly united by white nationalism. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=168.12s)]
*  They appear to be affiliated with the group Patriot Front. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=173.28s)]
*  They call themselves Patriot Front. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=178.08s)]
*  They have ridiculous little uniforms. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=180.44s)]
*  You might recognize them by their distinctive matching khakis, which is supposed to be [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  menacing instead of making it look like they all just got off work together at Best Buy. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=187.08s)]
*  But this was them in D.C. last year trying to intimidate with their little homemade shields [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=192.4s)]
*  and their JV soccer shin guards. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=196.36s)]
*  This group is a renamed version of one of the white nationalist groups that took part [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=203.4s)]
*  The group renamed itself after one of its members killed Heather Heyer, a counter-protester, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=206.8s)]
*  and seriously injured a ton of other people when he deliberately drove his speeding car [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  into a crowd of anti-racist protesters. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=217.44000000000003s)]
*  But them targeting the Pride event in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, this weekend, one of the most [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=222.44s)]
*  unnerving things about the reporting on this was that Patriot Front was apparently not [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  even the only armed far-right group that was targeting that particular Pride event in that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=231.88s)]
*  particular part of Idaho this weekend. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  Another so-called Patriot group had planned a show-off-your-gun event to coincide with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=240.24s)]
*  and menace that same Pride gathering in Coeur d'Alene. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=246.36s)]
*  The same weekend, a different group of Proud Boys stormed into a library in the San Francisco [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=250.48s)]
*  Bay Area and disrupted a children's story session, shouting anti-gay and anti-trans threats [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=254.88s)]
*  because the story time was led by a drag queen and so they were there to break it up by force. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=261.32s)]
*  You will notice that the targets of these various fascist pro-Trump paramilitary groups [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=269.4s)]
*  like Patriot Front, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, you'll notice that their targets are the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=274.08s)]
*  political targets of our current Republican Party, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=278.92s)]
*  The paramilitary groups are providing physical attacks, physical intimidation, to reinforce [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=281.6s)]
*  political attacks. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=286.44s)]
*  Democrats and deep state actors are trying to steal the election. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, these will be the groups that will be the tip of the spear that violently storm [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=291.08000000000004s)]
*  into the Capitol to stop that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  Gay folks and trans folks are going after our children, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, these groups will storm Pride festivals and supposedly objectionable children's story [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  groups and menace people with weapons and with threats. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=307.16s)]
*  They'll put physical force behind the political threats from the Republican Party. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=310.8s)]
*  There are historical and sociological reasons behind the existence of fascist paramilitary [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=315.32000000000005s)]
*  organizations in the United States. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=320.94000000000005s)]
*  This is not our first rodeo with these clowns. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=322.70000000000005s)]
*  But it is a different thing altogether when paramilitary groups like this start playing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=326.72s)]
*  a political function adjunct to one of the two major parties in our country. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  That is a very, very bad sign. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpeXmRyKjSM&t=336.72s)]
