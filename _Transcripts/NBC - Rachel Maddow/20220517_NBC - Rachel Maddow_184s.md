# Site Of Buffalo Shooting A Community Hub With Deep Roots
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc)
*  The city of Buffalo, New York has a beautiful, extensive and famous system of parks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=0.0s)]
*  The legendary landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, after he designed Central Park [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=8.6s)]
*  in New York City, he had an even bigger vision for Buffalo, a system of multiple city parks [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=12.88s)]
*  connected by tree-lined parkways, thereby integrating the parks into the city. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=17.94s)]
*  And one of those early parkways was called Humboldt Parkway. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=24.28s)]
*  In the first half of the 20th century, a black middle-class neighborhood called Hamlin Park [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=28.72s)]
*  began to emerge around it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=33.48s)]
*  It was lovely. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=35.68s)]
*  And so, of course, as in black neighborhoods and cities across the country, in the 1950s [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=38.04s)]
*  and the 1960s, city planners decided to build a giant highway right through the middle of it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=42.2s)]
*  First, they cut down all those grand trees on Humboldt Parkway. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=47.4s)]
*  Then they dug out the whole parkway to construct an expressway to better connect mostly white [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=51.44s)]
*  suburban drivers to downtown Buffalo. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=56.64s)]
*  That new expressway cut off that black community in Buffalo. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=59.44s)]
*  It also poured more pollution into that black neighborhood, which over the decades has had [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=63.08s)]
*  serious health implications for that community. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=67.4s)]
*  It also cut off black residents stuck on the east side of that highway from the basic necessities [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=69.8s)]
*  of life, like grocery stores. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=75.6s)]
*  That's why in 2003, something as simple as a grocery store finally opening on Buffalo's [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=79.0s)]
*  east side, that was a big newsmaking event because residents on the east side had been [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=84.76s)]
*  calling for a grocery store, literally something that basic and simple, for years and years [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=90.44000000000001s)]
*  and years before they finally got one. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=95.2s)]
*  When that grocery store, the Tops Market on Jefferson Avenue, opened in 2003, it became [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=97.28s)]
*  not just the local grocery store, but a community gathering place for the resilient, long-standing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=101.76s)]
*  east side black community in Buffalo. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=109.2s)]
*  And that's why it was targeted. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=112.78s)]
*  In his racist online rantings, the gunman who killed 10 people and injured three more [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  at that Tops Market this weekend, he said he zeroed in on the specific zip code of that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  store because it had one of the highest shares of black residents in all of New York State. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=125.22s)]
*  One of the most segregated cities in the country, he picked out the area with the highest concentration [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=130.58s)]
*  of black residents, and then he targeted the place where those residents were most likely [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=134.74s)]
*  to congregate. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=138.68s)]
*  As NBC's Ben Collins just reported here on our air moments ago, the alleged shooter [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=140.42s)]
*  also mused online about possibly targeting a church in that neighborhood or maybe a school. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=144.04s)]
*  He decided on the Tops grocery store instead because targeting a grocery store was novel, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=150.26s)]
*  and he wanted to have the maximum terrorizing effect. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=155.7s)]
*  He wanted to make black Americans feel unsafe literally anywhere they might go. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNmLP6ZCZc&t=158.82s)]
