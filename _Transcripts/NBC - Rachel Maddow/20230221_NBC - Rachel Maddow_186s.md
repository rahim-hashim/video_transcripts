# As Biden leads West in support of democracy in Ukraine, weird assemblage voices dissent
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc)
*  And the American connections to these politics, they can be hard to follow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=0.0s)]
*  For example, this weekend there was a random, and I mean truly random, rally on the National [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=6.36s)]
*  Mall in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=11.76s)]
*  A rally in support of Russia, I guess, given all the Russian flags. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=13.52s)]
*  At least a rally against the U.S. supporting Ukraine in trying to stand up against the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=19.8s)]
*  Russian invasion of their country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=26.6s)]
*  This was a tiny event. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=28.5s)]
*  It was small. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=29.64s)]
*  It was a weird assemblage of Americans. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=30.64s)]
*  There were Proud Boys there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  There were some of the white supremacist groups you'd recognize from the Unite the Right rally [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=34.06s)]
*  in Charlottesville a few years ago. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=37.6s)]
*  Also represented prominently, the remains of the bizarre Lyndon LaRouche cult. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=40.4s)]
*  There were a lot of people with Russian flags. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=46.36s)]
*  Also the occasional flag of the former Soviet Union. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=48.56s)]
*  Also at least one person who guest hosts for Tucker Carlson on the Fox News Channel was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=54.36s)]
*  there as a featured speaker. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  There were anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists, a lot of them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  There were cryptocurrency promoters. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=65.25999999999999s)]
*  It was a really weird group. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=67.16s)]
*  It was a small rally and a weird one. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=68.72s)]
*  But that's what it looks like. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  That's the assemblage of short straws and split ends and loose change and loose electrons [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=75.46s)]
*  that's advocating in this country that Russia's in the right in this war and America should [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=79.9s)]
*  be on Putin's side as he keeps invading other countries. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=85.84s)]
*  I mean, no disrespect to the Americans who turned out as part of this small event this [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  weekend, but it's not like they represent a big constituency that is arguing for this [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  pro-Russia point of view. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=100.76s)]
*  But while this happened this weekend, meanwhile, President Biden was heading to Kiev secretly. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=105.64s)]
*  And once he got there today and we all found out that he had made the trip to Kiev, at [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  least one pro-Trump Republican member of Congress who happens to have a seat on the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=114.52s)]
*  Homeland Security Committee called for him to be impeached for having gone to Ukraine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=118.56s)]
*  Other pro-Trump Republican members of Congress today said it was a disgrace and a shame. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=125.64s)]
*  And how dare President Biden go to Ukraine today? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=130.6s)]
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who wants to run for president, apparently, he went on [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=134.44s)]
*  the Fox News Channel this morning and said that President Biden was wrong to go and we [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=139.24s)]
*  shouldn't be supporting Ukraine in this war because whatever Russia is doing, it's nothing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=144.12s)]
*  to worry about. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  Again, it is not clear in political terms what the big constituency is for this stuff. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=150.0s)]
*  But that is where at least the Trump and Trumpish wing of the Republican Party says they are [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=158.32s)]
*  on this issue. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=163.32s)]
*  And good luck to them with it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni7CKY6K-cc&t=164.32s)]
