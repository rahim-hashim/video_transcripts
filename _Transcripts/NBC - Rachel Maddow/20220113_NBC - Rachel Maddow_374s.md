# Michigan Attorney General Refers Probe Of Fake Electors To Federal Prosecutors
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs)
*  Well now, as we've been reporting this week, 16 Michigan Republicans went on to sign their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=0.0s)]
*  names to fake elector documents, claiming that Trump was the rightful winner of Michigan's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=5.44s)]
*  electoral votes, claiming that they were therefore the rightful electors and should be counted [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=10.76s)]
*  as such. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=15.16s)]
*  They sent those documents to the National Archives, to the United States Senate, to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=16.26s)]
*  be counted as part of Trump's electoral tally. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=20.36s)]
*  This is the same weird Republican forgery scheme that was apparently being run in at [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=24.16s)]
*  least five states in what appears to have been a coordinated effort. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=28.44s)]
*  It is now starting to catch the attention, apparently, of multiple investigations that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=32.08s)]
*  are looking into the effort to overturn the election and the attack on January 6th. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=36.34s)]
*  The person who's in charge of Michigan's elections is Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=40.84s)]
*  She and her staff have reportedly spoken to the January 6th investigation in Congress, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=45.28s)]
*  including to provide information about the forged elector documents in her state. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=50.16s)]
*  We know that from a public records request filed by the Detroit News. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  But we also know this, according to a spokesperson for the attorney general's office in Michigan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=58.04s)]
*  This matter, the fake elector assertion, these forged documents from Michigan Republicans, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=63.0s)]
*  this is, according to a spokeswoman for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, this is part [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=68.8s)]
*  of an ongoing investigation in the state of Michigan. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=72.84s)]
*  Joining us now are both Jocelyn Benson, Secretary of State in Michigan, and Dana Nessel, who's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=76.92s)]
*  Michigan's attorney general. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  Secretary Benson, General Nessel, thank you both for being here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=82.72s)]
*  I really appreciate you both being here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=85.2s)]
*  I know it's a coup to have either one of you, but to have you both is a real pleasure. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=86.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=91.16s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=92.16s)]
*  Maybe not take out coups as much because I know it's sensitive to happen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=93.16s)]
*  Well, Madam Attorney General, let me start with you. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=100.16s)]
*  We have had questions since we started to realize the scope of this scheme as to whether [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=104.92s)]
*  or not this implicates any criminal acts, whether or not it's legal to forge an election [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=110.08s)]
*  related document like this to assert yourself to be a public official effectively when you're [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=115.64s)]
*  not. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=122.04s)]
*  Is this potentially a matter for the criminal investigation? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=123.04s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely it is. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=126.08s)]
*  And I will tell you that we've been evaluating charges for nearly a year now based on these [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=128.44s)]
*  activities as soon as we became aware of that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=134.68s)]
*  So I will say under state law, I think clearly you have forgery of a public record, which [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=137.5s)]
*  is a 14 year offense and election law forgery, which is a five year offense. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=143.0s)]
*  But what we have decided to do with the investigation in light of the fact that, of course, we have [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=148.12s)]
*  seen, as you pointed out multiple times now, various different false slate of electors [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=152.44s)]
*  from seven different states in what seems to be a coordinated effort between the Republican [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  parties in various different states. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=164.32s)]
*  We think this is a matter that is best investigated and potentially prosecuted by the feds. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  And as such, just today, we referred this matter to the Western District, the U.S. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=172.48s)]
*  Attorney's Office for them to evaluate it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=178.2s)]
*  And we hope that Maine Justice and the Department of Justice will become involved and use the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=180.72s)]
*  information they already have to better understand exactly what happened that day so that federal [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=185.28s)]
*  charges can be evaluated. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=191.2s)]
*  So you, your office, Attorney General's Office in Michigan has referred this matter for potential [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  prosecution to the federal prosecutor's office in Michigan as of today. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=199.44s)]
*  As of today, we've been evaluating what we were going to do with it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=206.44s)]
*  And we had thought that it was very possible that we would be bringing charges. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  But we still might. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=214.0s)]
*  We still might. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=215.56s)]
*  And of course, there's no double jeopardy if you were to bring both state and federal [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=216.56s)]
*  charges for the same offenses. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=220.16s)]
*  But obviously, this is part of a much bigger conspiracy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=222.88s)]
*  And our hope is that the federal authorities and the Department of Justice and United States [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland will take this in coordination with all the other information [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=233.56s)]
*  they've received and make an evaluation as to what charges these individuals might face. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=238.2s)]
*  I mean, I can think of many, forgery of a public record for the purposes of defrauding [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=243.6s)]
*  the United States or conspiracy to commit an offense to defraud the United States. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=248.04s)]
*  And there's so many others. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=253.16s)]
*  But that will be up for the feds to decide. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=255.04s)]
*  And Attorney General Nessel, let me just ask you, as a legal matter, you've already referenced [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=258.08000000000004s)]
*  this in relation to the idea that this might best be prosecuted as a federal matter because [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=262.92s)]
*  it happened in multiple states. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=267.48s)]
*  But if we are able to figure out, if the country is able to figure out who did this—I mean, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=269.64000000000004s)]
*  this was a paint-by-numbers, fill-in-the-blank template that all of these Republicans used [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  in five, at least five different states, to do this. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  If we can figure out who distributed the template, who put them up to this, who told them how [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=282.88s)]
*  to do it, does that change anything about the potentially criminal nature or the seriousness [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=286.48s)]
*  of this? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=291.32s)]
*  I think it does. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=292.32s)]
*  And I think that you're talking about a conspiracy really to overthrow the United States government. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=295.32s)]
*  I mean, at the end of the day, that's what we're talking about. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=300.32s)]
*  So why I think it's so important to refer this to the federal authorities is because [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=304.68s)]
*  for a lot of these individuals—and the irony, of course, is that many of those people that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=309.12s)]
*  you saw outside the state capitol on December 14th that you showed footage of, they're the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=313.92s)]
*  loudest who complained of election fraud. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=319.6s)]
*  And yet here they have committed, ostensibly, the most significant case of election fraud [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=322.4s)]
*  ever in our state's history. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=329.76s)]
*  But I think it's important that once those individuals see that they could possibly be [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=332.76s)]
*  facing prison time, I do think we're going to see some people flip and we'll get some [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=338.4s)]
*  further information as to who orchestrated this in the first place, who told these people [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=343.76000000000005s)]
*  to do this in exactly this fashion. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=347.68s)]
*  And I think it may go all the way to the top. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyb9b7mOSNs&t=351.0s)]
