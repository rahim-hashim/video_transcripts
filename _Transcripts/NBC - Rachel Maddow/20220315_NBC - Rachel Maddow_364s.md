# 'Russia Will Not Stop': Ukraine Presses Case For More Support
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs)
*  One of the people working side by side with President Zelensky as he directs the country's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=0.0s)]
*  war effort and tries to rally support from Western allies is Sergei Leshchenko, who currently [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=4.66s)]
*  serves as an advisor to President Zelensky's chief of staff. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=10.48s)]
*  And joining us now is Sergei Leshchenko. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=15.84s)]
*  Mr. Leshchenko, thank you for making time for us tonight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=18.12s)]
*  Today, President Zelensky spoke to the Canadian Parliament. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=21.28s)]
*  Tomorrow, he's going to address the U.S. Congress. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=24.16s)]
*  What does the president want to achieve in talking to U.S. lawmakers tomorrow? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=26.94s)]
*  Our president want to have the coalition to support Ukraine in this brutal war started [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=33.38s)]
*  by Russia. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=39.5s)]
*  We need weapons. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=41.02s)]
*  We need military support on the ground, but especially on the air. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=42.26s)]
*  We called for closing the sky to have non-flying zone over Ukraine to stop bombing of Ukrainian [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=46.900000000000006s)]
*  cities. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=54.46s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have negative answer from our partners. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=55.54s)]
*  Then we called to provide us Soviet fighter jets, which are now based in our neighbor [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=59.82s)]
*  countries, which are members of NATO. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=66.54s)]
*  But unfortunately, this operation was not succeed as well. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=69.7s)]
*  For today, we are calling for more anti-aircraft support, because what you see on the ground, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=74.26s)]
*  Russia is quite weak. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=79.98s)]
*  Their army is not that powerful. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=82.18s)]
*  Their army is just big and long, but they have powerful aircraft, powerful fighters, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=84.14s)]
*  powerful bombing, and they destroyed a lot of Ukrainian cities. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=91.33999999999999s)]
*  They started to attack Kiev. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  Starting from the weekend, they bombed our not just neighborhoods of Kiev, but city of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=97.66s)]
*  Kiev itself. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  And to stop this, we need support on the sky. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=105.89999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, so today we have very weak answer from our partners on this topic. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=109.78s)]
*  That is why President going to address the issue for American lawmakers and American [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=115.74000000000001s)]
*  citizens to call for unity, to call for solidarity, to call for humanism, to provide more support [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=120.66s)]
*  for Ukraine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=127.94s)]
*  We are very much appreciate all support done by American citizens, American government [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=128.94s)]
*  for Ukraine. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=133.5s)]
*  But as President told today to British Prime Minister, the support provided us for a week. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=134.58s)]
*  We spend the support during 20 hours. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=142.46s)]
*  We need more weapons to defend our country. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=145.26s)]
*  One of the problem, Mr. Leshchenko, is that NATO countries are saying that Ukraine is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=151.26s)]
*  not a NATO member. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=156.9s)]
*  Today, when he addressed the EU leaders, President Zelensky appeared to give up on the prospect [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=158.1s)]
*  of Ukraine ever joining NATO. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=164.10000000000002s)]
*  Ukraine's constitution commits Ukraine to actually pursuing membership in NATO. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=167.10000000000002s)]
*  So why did that happen? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=171.18s)]
*  Why did the President say he thinks that Ukraine is not going to join NATO, which is exactly [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=172.22s)]
*  what Vladimir Putin wants? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=179.10000000000002s)]
*  I cannot commend President to what he said. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=182.34s)]
*  This is his legal right to say. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=185.06s)]
*  But you know what is going on in Ukraine now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=187.78s)]
*  The war and Ukraine expected to have more support from our partners, especially in this [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=190.34s)]
*  critical moment, because Ukraine not just fighting for ourselves. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=195.7s)]
*  Ukraine is fighting for Europe. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=200.01999999999998s)]
*  We defend Europe from Russia because, believe me, Russia will not stop on Ukraine. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=202.17999999999998s)]
*  Russia will expand their power toward European countries, toward Baltic countries, Poland, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=207.22s)]
*  so members of NATO. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  The idea of Putin is not just to occupy Ukraine or to make this denatification of Ukraine [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  or demilitarization of Ukraine as he announced. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=221.78s)]
*  His goal is to destroy the global order created after the Second World War in Yalta, which [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  is occupied, by the way, eight years ago by Russia. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  That is why Ukraine is calling for support from our partners to provide the weapons which [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=235.62s)]
*  we are looking for. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=241.06s)]
*  But unfortunately, the answer is very weak. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=242.78s)]
*  The argument is that if we as NATO members provide these weapons to Ukraine, we will [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=245.3s)]
*  escalate, we will provoke Russia more. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=251.62s)]
*  But my question is, if you as our partners are afraid to provide us these weapons, because [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=255.22s)]
*  Russia can be nervous, will you accept our application to NATO, which makes Russia crazy? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  It looks like you're not going to do this. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  It looks like we are living in a dream, but it's time to wake up because we are losing [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=273.54s)]
*  our country, we are losing our people, we are losing our economy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=280.1s)]
*  And we have to find the form of our guarantees, of our sovereignty, of our integrity, of our [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=283.3s)]
*  security, because without these guarantees, this war can happen again and again. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=291.38s)]
*  That is why the idea of negotiation now is to find the formula of these security guarantees. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=297.14s)]
*  Can be security guarantees from our neighbor countries, can be security guarantees from [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=303.54s)]
*  our guarantors from Budapest Memorandum 1994, when Ukraine stopped nuclear program [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=308.1s)]
*  as a post-Soviet country. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=316.58s)]
*  And this Budapest Memorandum was just lame duck not able to defend Ukraine. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=319.3s)]
*  So this is a part of negotiation now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  But the problem is that Ukraine is living in the state of war three weeks already, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=327.3s)]
*  and we are looking for more support from our partners. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=333.38s)]
*  Sergey Leschenko is the current advisor to President Zelensky, chief of staff. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=337.06s)]
*  Mr. Leschenko, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=341.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=343.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkU72ysbGs&t=357.3s)]
