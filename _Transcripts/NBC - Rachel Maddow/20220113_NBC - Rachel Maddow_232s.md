# Right-Wing Supreme Court Blocks Covid Protections For Workers
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q)
*  So, this is the dissent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  This is from the start of the dissent from Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=3.0s)]
*  and Justice Stephen Breyer. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=8.52s)]
*  I bring this to you tonight because every once in a while, the dissent is just destined [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  to ring louder in history than the ruling, and this has all the markers of that tonight. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=16.12s)]
*  Quote, every day, COVID-19 poses grave dangers to the citizens of this country, and particularly [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=22.44s)]
*  to its workers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=28.96s)]
*  The disease has by now killed almost one million Americans and hospitalized almost four million. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=30.36s)]
*  It spreads by person-to-person contact in confined indoor spaces, so causes harm in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=36.1s)]
*  nearly all workplace environments. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=41.6s)]
*  And in those environments, more than any others, individuals have little control and therefore [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=44.08s)]
*  little capacity to mitigate risk. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=48.08s)]
*  COVID-19, in short, is a menace in work settings. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=50.88s)]
*  The proof is all around us. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=54.88s)]
*  Since the disease's onset, most Americans have seen their workplaces transformed. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=56.32s)]
*  So the administrative agency charged with ensuring health and safety in workplaces did [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=61.28s)]
*  what Congress commanded it to do. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=66.4s)]
*  It took action to address COVID's continuing threat in those spaces. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=68.76s)]
*  OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, issued an emergency temporary standard requiring [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=73.44s)]
*  either vaccination or masking and testing to protect American workers. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=82.48s)]
*  The standard falls within the core of the agency's mission to protect employees from [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  grave danger that comes from new hazards or exposure to harmful agents. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  OSHA estimates, and there is no ground for disputing, that the standard they proposed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=98.88s)]
*  would save more than 6,500 lives and prevent over a quarter million hospitalizations just [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  in six months' time. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=112.4s)]
*  Yet today, the court issues a stay that prevents the standard from taking effect. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=115.36s)]
*  In our view, the court's order seriously misapplies the applicable legal standards, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=120.0s)]
*  and in so doing, it stymies the federal government's ability to counter the unparalleled threat [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  that COVID poses to our nation's workers. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=128.88s)]
*  Acting outside of its competence and without legal basis, the court displaces the judgments [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=131.72s)]
*  officials given the responsibility to respond to workplace health emergencies. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=137.88s)]
*  Quote, we respectfully dissent. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=143.2s)]
*  Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer dissenting today from the ruling [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=149.12s)]
*  by the conservatives on the Supreme Court, which did block the OSHA workplace safety [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=153.72s)]
*  rule for large employers that would have required workers to either be vaccinated or to get [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=158.88s)]
*  regularly tested. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, in a separate ruling today, the court did leave in place the vaccine requirement [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  for people who work in a healthcare setting. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=169.32s)]
*  But if you don't work in a healthcare setting, if you're stacking shelves or you're on the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=172.28s)]
*  factory floor or working in a big open plan cubicle farm and your workplace doesn't want [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=175.84s)]
*  to try to protect you from a COVID-rich environment, well, the Supreme Court just blocked the Biden [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  administration from helping you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=186.44s)]
*  The Supreme Court just blocked the Biden administration from being allowed to require that your workplace [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=188.48s)]
*  be made more safe. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=194.4s)]
*  It's not necessarily an unexpected ruling, given how right-wing the Supreme Court is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=196.0s)]
*  right now and how weird and scientifically uninformed the conservative justices' questions [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=202.32s)]
*  were during the oral arguments, but now it is done. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc7K0s1mf3Q&t=208.12s)]
