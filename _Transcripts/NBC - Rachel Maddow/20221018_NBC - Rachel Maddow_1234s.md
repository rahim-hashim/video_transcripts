# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Oct. 17
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ)
*  But one of the lessons that emerges quickly when you spend time looking at this history [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=0.0s)]
*  of the violent ultra-right, not just internationally but here in the United States, one of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=4.72s)]
*  things that just comes home again and again is that fascist, violent authoritarian messaging [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=9.68s)]
*  very, very, very often comes with a big heaping helping of anti-Semitism. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=15.6s)]
*  People who want to throw a government by force, people who want to get rid of democratically [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=23.02s)]
*  elected leaders and instead install some leader using violence, whipping people up toward believing [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=27.22s)]
*  that there's no political solution, that there has to be violence instead, that there are [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=32.86s)]
*  enemies who have infiltrated the country and so the whole thing needs to be burned down [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=36.14s)]
*  and cleansed and started over this time with us in charge. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=39.98s)]
*  And that whole line of argument, that whole form of insidious messaging depends on their [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=43.12s)]
*  being an other, right? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=49.96s)]
*  Some sort of very powerful cabal that's secretly in charge and pulling all the strings and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=51.78s)]
*  they need to be rooted out. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=56.26s)]
*  Again and again and again over time and in lots of different countries but including [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=58.68s)]
*  in ours, that is core to fascist and authoritarian messaging. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=62.36s)]
*  And Jewish people are perennially targeted, scapegoated and insinuated against by people [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=66.96s)]
*  who are making those kinds of arguments. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=72.48s)]
*  It happens over and over again around the world and in our history too, even though [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=74.1s)]
*  we don't often like to remember it happening here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=77.92s)]
*  We like to look back at the late 30s and the 40s and remember that we were the country [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=80.5s)]
*  that joined the fight against Hitler and stopped what he was doing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=84.56s)]
*  Right? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  And also there's this truth is stranger than fiction dark history of the forces in our [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=90.36s)]
*  country who wanted us either not to fight Germany or if we were going to fight they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=96.72s)]
*  wanted us to fight on Hitler's side. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=102.16s)]
*  This is all imagery from the United States that we're showing here on the screen right [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=108.64s)]
*  There were powerful, well-connected and indeed well-armed forces in the United States in [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=112.38s)]
*  the lead up to World War II who wanted us fighting on Hitler's side because of what [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=116.74s)]
*  Hitler was saying about Jewish people and what he was doing to Jewish people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  We had an ultra-right movement here in America that sided with that 80, 85 years ago. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  And the fight against them back then I think is fascinating and that's what I've been [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=134.32s)]
*  working on with this podcast. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=138.34s)]
*  I think that there's a lot for us to learn from the Americans who went before us who [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=139.74s)]
*  had to fight against that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=143.12s)]
*  But if you study this stuff in history, right, I mean it's almost unbelievable that it happened [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=145.12s)]
*  at all when it happened. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=151.22s)]
*  But then when you're in the middle of studying that history you have news cycles like the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=153.28s)]
*  one we're in right now and it feels all the more impossible that this is what's happening [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=156.22s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean in our current news cycle right now you've got the immediate former president [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  putting out a statement on social media that's some kind of ominous vague warning for Americans [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=168.52s)]
*  who are Jewish saying Jews need to be more appreciative of him. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=172.76s)]
*  Jews need to quote get their act together. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=176.84s)]
*  He says quote before it's too late. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=179.56s)]
*  Nobody knows what he's talking about or what he's threatening American Jews with here but [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=183.12s)]
*  this is really happening now. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=188.7s)]
*  We're three weeks out from the next election after the last one when he sent an armed mob [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  of his supporters to try to violently overthrow the government and stop the transfer of power [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=197.14s)]
*  and make him leader by force of arms. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=200.98s)]
*  Last week the Republican Party posted this on social media. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=203.74s)]
*  Kanye, Elon, Trump. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=206.9s)]
*  The latter of course is the guy who just posted the Jews better get their act together message. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  The former is the guy who just posted that while he was sleepy right the second as soon [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=213.45999999999998s)]
*  as he woke up he was going to go death con three on Jewish people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=217.34s)]
*  The middle guy in that triad is the one who has reportedly been in direct contact with [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=225.26s)]
*  the fascist dictator in Russia who's currently waging war on Ukraine. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=229.66s)]
*  He's the guy who's recently been promoting an appeasement plan to get Western countries [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=234.82s)]
*  to back off and just let the Russian dictator keep whatever parts of other countries he [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  wants to invade and occupy and we should leave him alone to do it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=242.73999999999998s)]
*  So the House Republican tweet naming those three guys as the holy trinity of the Republican [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=247.18s)]
*  Party right now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=251.98s)]
*  Kanye, Elon, Trump. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=253.7s)]
*  That's still up. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=255.17999999999998s)]
*  With the before it's too late threat that the Jews need to get their act together with [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=259.82s)]
*  the going death con three on Jewish people threat and also with the guy in touch with [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=264.34s)]
*  Putin trying to get everybody else to back off and let him invade who he wants. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=268.65999999999997s)]
*  That's still up from an official Republican Party Twitter account. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=272.82s)]
*  And all of this is it is a good reminder that anti-Semitism and authoritarianism very very [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=279.86s)]
*  very often go together. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=287.78000000000003s)]
*  It is also a reminder that neither of these things are fights that are consigned to history. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=289.86s)]
*  I mean our generation gets our turn in the barrel with these things now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=294.06s)]
*  Whatever you might have admired about Americans in the past who confronted these things in [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=298.2s)]
*  the past well now's your chance to emulate what they did that you think was right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  Whatever you might have resented or been disappointed in and thinking about Americans in the past [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=306.22s)]
*  who didn't rise to the occasion who stuck their heads in the sand who pretended it wasn't [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=309.86s)]
*  happening who let it slide. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=313.78s)]
*  Well now's your chance to not emulate them because this is our turn with this stuff. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=315.26s)]
*  Two and a half years ago in the spring of 2020 as the corona pandemic was just coronavirus [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=322.86s)]
*  pandemic was just starting to rage the White House installed a Trump campaign aid to take [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=328.94s)]
*  over the CDC. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=336.5s)]
*  Somebody with zero public health experience somebody with zero science experience put [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=338.38s)]
*  that person in there to basically ride herd at the CDC. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=342.38s)]
*  With that appointment the CDC had to run everything through this Trump campaign aid. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=346.1s)]
*  Anything they wanted to say to the American public about the pandemic first had to be [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=350.94s)]
*  approved by that random guy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=353.98s)]
*  And that included the CDC's gold standard scientific reports which are called MMWRs [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=356.9s)]
*  more bill morbidity and mortality weekly reports. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=362.34s)]
*  MMWR is written by career scientists and during the pandemic just as in every public health [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=365.3s)]
*  crisis before before it in the modern era MMWR has served to inform doctors and researchers [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=370.98s)]
*  and the public about the latest crisis. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=377.9s)]
*  In this case it was COVID-19 how it was spreading who is at risk the best proven ways to protect [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=380.9s)]
*  yourself. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=385.38s)]
*  MMWR is the international gold standard for public health communications. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=386.98s)]
*  It is often described as the voice of the CDC as a rule MMWR reports are never reviewed [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=392.34s)]
*  by political staff they are purely science. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=397.94s)]
*  But then this Trump appointee comes in and he starts berating CDC scientists because [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=401.94s)]
*  their purely scientific information about COVID is making Donald Trump look bad. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  While the congressional investigation into the government's COVID response has just today [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=413.26s)]
*  released new emails they obtained from this period. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=416.26s)]
*  The president of the United States of America, for example, is the top staffer to that Trump [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=419.86s)]
*  campaign guy responding to a new MMWR report about COVID risks to children. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=422.86s)]
*  He says quote, who writes this garbage? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=428.86s)]
*  He says the CDC director quote, gots to start firing people in large numbers there. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=431.86s)]
*  This agency is working against the president daily. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=437.86s)]
*  Yeah, he gots to do that. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=441.86s)]
*  There's dozens and dozens of emails like this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=443.86s)]
*  He was the first to write Trump's own chief of staff. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=445.90000000000003s)]
*  White House chief of staff personally calls the deputy director of the CDC to dress her [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  down and yell at her. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  Over a different MMWR he thought made Trump look particularly bad. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=453.90000000000003s)]
*  That deputy director at CDC said she'd never gotten a call from a White House chief of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=457.90000000000003s)]
*  staff in her 33-year career at CDC before that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=461.90000000000003s)]
*  But again, these were scientists writing scientific reports about an ongoing worsening [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  pandemic. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=471.90000000000003s)]
*  The CDC director at CDC said those scientific reports had to go, they had to be changed [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=473.94s)]
*  to make Trump not look so bad. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=477.94s)]
*  The science be damned. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=479.94s)]
*  And today we learned the extent to which they succeeded in meddling with that science. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=481.94s)]
*  According to this new report from the investigation into the Trump administration's COVID [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=485.94s)]
*  response, Trump political appointees weighted in to meddle with at least 19 different [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=489.94s)]
*  scientific reports about the pandemic. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=495.94s)]
*  Today's report concludes quote, the degree of control and hostility that the Trump [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=498.94s)]
*  administration exerted over the historically independent agency not only demoralized CDC [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=502.98s)]
*  officials but also undermined Americans trust in public health. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=507.98s)]
*  As we now head into our third winter living with COVID and new variants continue to evolve [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=513.98s)]
*  and less than 10% of Americans have gotten the latest vaccine booster, we're reminded [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=517.98s)]
*  every day that that eroded trust in public health will take a long, long time to rebuild [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=523.98s)]
*  if we ever can. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=527.98s)]
*  Quote, the previous administration engaged in an unprecedented campaign of political [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=530.02s)]
*  interference in the federal government's pandemic response, which undermined public health [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=536.02s)]
*  to benefit the former president's political goals. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=540.02s)]
*  That is the conclusion today from the chair of the congressional investigation into the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=544.02s)]
*  Trump administration's COVID response that just released a new report detailing how bad [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=548.02s)]
*  political interference was with the CDC and the lasting damage that it did. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=553.02s)]
*  Joining us now is Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=558.06s)]
*  He is the chair of that investigation which released this report today. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=561.06s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=564.06s)]
*  It's a pleasure to have you here. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=566.06s)]
*  Well, thank you very much for having me. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=568.06s)]
*  While it was happening here on the show, we tried to pretty closely cover what appeared [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=571.06s)]
*  to be political interference in the CDC's work. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=576.06s)]
*  Even still, reading your report today, it is way worse than I thought. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=579.06s)]
*  I wonder if you felt that way. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=585.06s)]
*  I wonder if you felt that way. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=586.0999999999999s)]
*  Was there more damage done than you were expecting to find at the outset of this inquiry? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=587.0999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=593.0999999999999s)]
*  We had a two-year investigation. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=594.0999999999999s)]
*  We attempted to pull back the curtains so that the people can see exactly what was taking [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=597.0999999999999s)]
*  place. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=603.0999999999999s)]
*  We knew from the general reports that there was some kind of interference taking place. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=604.0999999999999s)]
*  We had no idea the extent to which this administration was going in suppressing information, submitting [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=610.14s)]
*  misinformation, doing whatever they could to make this administration or that administration [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=621.14s)]
*  look better than they should have looked. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=628.14s)]
*  It was just incredible what they were doing. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=631.14s)]
*  Even deleting information, we had people testify that they were ordered to delete certain [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=634.18s)]
*  things. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=641.18s)]
*  In at least five instances, we saw where there were deletions and delays. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=642.18s)]
*  It was absolutely incredible. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=649.18s)]
*  I was struck in looking at the report how many times when you interviewed CDC officials [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=653.18s)]
*  and CDC scientists, they would all say some version of, you know, I've worked at CDC for [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=658.18s)]
*  X years, for X decades. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=663.2199999999999s)]
*  Nothing like this had ever happened before. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=665.2199999999999s)]
*  I'd never been confronted with this kind of interference before. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=667.2199999999999s)]
*  The fact that this was so unprecedented, that the CDC was previously so walled off from [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=670.2199999999999s)]
*  political interference, I wondered if you came to think that that might have been something [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=675.2199999999999s)]
*  that actually made them more vulnerable to this kind of meddling because basically they [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=679.2199999999999s)]
*  didn't have antibodies against it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=683.2199999999999s)]
*  They didn't have defenses because they'd never had to confront this kind of corruption before. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=685.2199999999999s)]
*  I think that's a fair conclusion to draw. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=690.26s)]
*  These are scientists. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=694.26s)]
*  These are people who believe that their purpose is to protect the American people. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=696.26s)]
*  We had the worst medical problem in this country in 100 years, and they were dedicated to [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=702.26s)]
*  learning from past experiences and doing the things that are necessary to protect the public. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=710.26s)]
*  They were not prepared to have to deal with political interference. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=716.3s)]
*  In fact, that's not their long suit. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=721.3s)]
*  Their job is simply to do the research, do the science, inform the public, and then hopefully [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=723.3s)]
*  the leadership would be there by the politicians to do as necessary to protect the public. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=733.3s)]
*  Instead, they had their information supplanted and deleted, and in many instances they were [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=739.3399999999999s)]
*  insulted and embarrassed. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=749.3399999999999s)]
*  The importance of this kind of inquiry, the importance of this kind of report is to get the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=753.3399999999999s)]
*  history right about what happened. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=757.3399999999999s)]
*  But the next step, of course, is making sure, using that history to make sure this doesn't happen [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=759.3399999999999s)]
*  again and that the CDC does have defense. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=763.3399999999999s)]
*  They do have people to go to. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=766.3399999999999s)]
*  They do have a way to defend themselves if anybody ever tries to do this to them again. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=768.38s)]
*  You've given us as a country the ammunition to do that. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=772.38s)]
*  Congressman James Clyburn, chair of the committee investigating the government's COVID response, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=776.38s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, thank you for being with us tonight and thank you for this important work. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=780.38s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=784.38s)]
*  Here's the headline in the Washington Post this weekend. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=786.38s)]
*  Racist GOP appeals heat up in final weeks before the midterms. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=789.38s)]
*  As the campaign heats up in the final weeks before November's midterm elections, so have overt [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=794.42s)]
*  appeals to racial animus and resentment. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=798.42s)]
*  And the toxic remarks appear to be receiving less pushback from Republicans than in past [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=801.42s)]
*  years, suggesting that some candidates in the first post-Trump election cycle have been [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=805.42s)]
*  influenced by the ex-president's norm-breaking example. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=809.42s)]
*  Quote, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, which works to counter anti-Semitism, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=813.42s)]
*  said, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=817.42s)]
*  It is not new to see anti-Semitism or overt racism in politics. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=818.4599999999999s)]
*  What is new is after years in which it was clear that to be credible in public life, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=822.4599999999999s)]
*  politicians had to reject prejudice. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=826.4599999999999s)]
*  It has now been normalized in ways that are really quite breathtaking. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=829.4599999999999s)]
*  He says, quote, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=834.4599999999999s)]
*  So, I mean, we're three weeks out from election day, and that's the message coming from one side, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=841.4599999999999s)]
*  which history is screaming at us about in terms of how dangerous this stuff is. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=846.5s)]
*  But to win elections, you can't just point at it. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=854.5s)]
*  You can't just point at anything and say, no, not that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=857.5s)]
*  There has to be another message. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=860.5s)]
*  There has to be a competing message in this case about why we should stay with political [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=862.5s)]
*  solutions to our problems. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=868.5s)]
*  We shouldn't blame some mythical other for ruining everything, which requires us to burn [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=869.5s)]
*  it all down and maybe abandon democracy and certainly abandon election results. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=874.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=879.54s)]
*  There's a case to be made not just against what they're advocating, but also why we should [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=880.54s)]
*  keep the democratic system we have had for more than 200 years in this country. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=885.54s)]
*  And so there's just this incredibly stark contrast for this election. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=888.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=892.54s)]
*  On the right, it's all these things we've been talking about, including blatant anti-Semitic [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=893.54s)]
*  appeals from the highest profile people on the conservative side of the aisle. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=897.54s)]
*  And no negative response to that from Republicans at large. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=902.5799999999999s)]
*  And from the Democratic Party on the other side, we've got like the most purely practical stuff. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=907.5799999999999s)]
*  It's literally, you know, hearing aids. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=914.5799999999999s)]
*  As of today, you can get hearing aids over the counter, which means they will be thousands [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=917.5799999999999s)]
*  and thousands and thousands of dollars cheaper. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=922.5799999999999s)]
*  The NIH estimates that more than 80 percent of Americans who could benefit from hearing aids [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=925.5799999999999s)]
*  don't use them in large part because they're really hard to get. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=930.62s)]
*  They're super expensive and most insurance plans don't cover them. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=933.62s)]
*  So you have to pay cash. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=936.62s)]
*  Starting today, you can just buy hearing aids over the counter, which makes it way easier [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=938.62s)]
*  and should bring the cost of hearing aids down by thousands of dollars, which should mean [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=943.62s)]
*  that millions of Americans who need help with hearing loss, whose lives would be seriously [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=948.62s)]
*  improved by having assistance with hearing loss problems, their lives are going to get better. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=955.66s)]
*  That's brand new as of today. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=963.66s)]
*  There was a vote five years ago in 2017 that made it possible for the FDA to do this and [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=964.66s)]
*  make it to allow hearing aids to be over the counter. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=969.66s)]
*  The Trump administration just sat on it for years and it didn't get done. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=972.66s)]
*  President Biden decided he was going to make it a priority. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=975.66s)]
*  He signed an executive order in August, giving the FDA 120 days to get it done, and they [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=977.66s)]
*  got it done. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=982.66s)]
*  And now as of today, life will be materially improved, both financially and in terms of [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=983.6999999999999s)]
*  quality of life, literally for millions of Americans who have hearing loss. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=988.6999999999999s)]
*  If you don't have it now, you very well may get it later. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=993.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this could benefit something like 30 million people. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=996.6999999999999s)]
*  And that's very practical. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1002.6999999999999s)]
*  And you might see that as kind of small ball politics, but that's the kind of thing that [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1004.6999999999999s)]
*  Democrats are putting on the table ahead of this election in three weeks. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1007.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, look at the look at the highest profile actions that President Biden and the Democrats [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1010.74s)]
*  have taken in the lead up to this election. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1015.74s)]
*  President Biden and Democrats passed legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs, to [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1018.74s)]
*  literally put a cap on the amount that seniors can pay out of pocket for prescriptions. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1023.74s)]
*  Republican senators have now introduced their plan to repeal it to make you pay more for [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1027.74s)]
*  prescriptions, especially you seniors. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1032.74s)]
*  OK, President Biden came up with a plan to reduce people's student loans. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1035.74s)]
*  Again, for millions and millions and millions of Americans, a hugely practical financial [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1039.78s)]
*  improvement in your lives. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1045.78s)]
*  Republican states are suing to try to get rid of that to make you pay more for your [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1047.78s)]
*  student loans. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1052.78s)]
*  President Biden recently pardoned people with convictions for possession of marijuana. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1054.78s)]
*  I don't think Republicans have come up with a way to challenge that yet, but they're just [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1058.78s)]
*  completely silent on it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1062.78s)]
*  They won't talk about it. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1063.78s)]
*  They're pretending it's not happening. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1064.78s)]
*  And this kind of stuff, these kinds of initiatives from the Democrats, these are implicitly an [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1066.82s)]
*  argument for democracy, right? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1071.82s)]
*  I mean, you see where I'm going with this. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1074.82s)]
*  The way you argue for democracy is not just by pointing the figure at people who want [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1076.82s)]
*  violence or fascism and saying, Whoa, that's bad. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1080.82s)]
*  That always works out badly. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1082.82s)]
*  I mean, you have to do that. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1083.82s)]
*  But you also need to make the positive case that democracy is a good idea, that democracy [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1085.82s)]
*  can deliver meaningful, practical improvements in America. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1089.82s)]
*  So I think that's why this election season feels so weird. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1093.86s)]
*  There's this mismatch from the two sides, right? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1097.86s)]
*  Republicans going apocalyptic, you know, end times, end of democracy, huge proportion of [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1101.86s)]
*  Republican voters, let alone Republican candidates, Republican voters saying unless their [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1106.86s)]
*  team wins, they will not accept the election results as legitimate because election results [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1111.86s)]
*  no longer are the way to go. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1116.86s)]
*  We've got simultaneously these overt anti-Semitic appeals from the highest profile people on [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1118.8999999999999s)]
*  their side of the aisle. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1123.8999999999999s)]
*  That's what's happening on the right. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1124.8999999999999s)]
*  While Democrats are like, hey, we not only like democracy, we are using our democratic [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1126.8999999999999s)]
*  system to do practical things that hopefully help you and your family. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1131.8999999999999s)]
*  And Republicans don't want those practical things to work. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1136.8999999999999s)]
*  They don't want to do things that are not practical. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1141.8999999999999s)]
*  And Republicans don't want those practical things to work. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1144.94s)]
*  But that's the argument from the Democrats. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1148.94s)]
*  Now, how is this playing out in individual races so far? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1151.94s)]
*  I believe it is still hard to tell. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1155.94s)]
*  In Georgia, early voting started today. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1158.94s)]
*  In Georgia, the Republican candidate in that marquee Senate race there, Herschel Walker, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1160.94s)]
*  was just asked about the cap on drug prices, including a cap on the price of insulin, which [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1164.94s)]
*  is a life or death necessity for people with diabetes. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1170.94s)]
*  He responded by suggesting that people really might not need the insulin if they would just [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1173.98s)]
*  eat right. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1177.98s)]
*  They don't really need the insulin. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1178.98s)]
*  How's that going to play in Georgia? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1180.98s)]
*  One party capping the price of insulin so that you don't break the bank, paying for [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1183.98s)]
*  a drug that you need to stay alive. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1188.98s)]
*  The other party saying, do you really need that? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1190.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCxA9rqP_iQ&t=1203.94s)]
