# 'Energizing': Maddow puts U.S. fight to defend democracy in global context
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo)
*  As the rule of law has bent and been broken by Trump and his movement, we've also seen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=0.0s)]
*  the democratic system bend and get broken by Trump and his movement. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  Obviously, we did not have a peaceful transfer of power the last time he competed in and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=10.76s)]
*  lost an election. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=15.64s)]
*  There is no commitment at all, no expectation at all by anyone that he and his followers [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=18.36s)]
*  will allow for a peaceful transfer of power this next time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  If he loses this next election as well. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=28.08s)]
*  He's not even giving lip service to the idea that they will allow for a peaceful transfer [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=32.56s)]
*  of power. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=36.8s)]
*  He won't even say it and not mean it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=37.8s)]
*  And even more importantly than that, just coming out of his face in his Republican Party, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=41.64s)]
*  accepting that his followers will not abide the results of the next election and neither [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  will the Republican Party in all of its power, in all of its resources, accepting that is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=55.800000000000004s)]
*  now the price of admission to power in that party. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=59.72s)]
*  In March of this year, the Republican National Committee hired two new lawyers to oversee [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=63.6s)]
*  the party's election year legal efforts. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=68.66s)]
*  Now just two months after that, of those two lawyers, one of them has been indicted for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  helping in the effort to keep him in power illegally after he lost the last election. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=76.76s)]
*  And the second one of those two lawyers has just been pushed out of his job at the RNC, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=81.16s)]
*  reportedly because he's not willing to do the same thing. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=85.12s)]
*  Quote, Trump originally approved of the hiring, one source told CNN. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=87.68s)]
*  But sources said Trump was then angered after his allies pointed to clips of the lawyer [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=92.12s)]
*  criticizing the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=97.36s)]
*  So two lawyers hired by the RNC to oversee legal efforts around the 2024 election, one [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=102.76s)]
*  of them herself now under indictment. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=109.66s)]
*  The other one reportedly fired for casting doubt that the last election was stolen, for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=111.82s)]
*  suggesting that the real election results were a real thing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=119.42s)]
*  Think about that for a second. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=123.58s)]
*  The chief counsel of the National Republican Party just fired reportedly because he was [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=124.97999999999999s)]
*  insufficiently enthusiastic about falsifying election results, about working to throw out [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=129.5s)]
*  and get Trump into power despite them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=135.3s)]
*  I know this feels like, you know, like an incremental update on the day's news, but [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=139.70000000000002s)]
*  just step back from this for a second. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=143.94s)]
*  If it is now the de facto position of the mainstream Republican Party that we are not [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=147.60000000000002s)]
*  going to use the real results of elections to decide who is in power, if in order to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  be in a position of authority in the Republican Party now, you must now pledge to reject election [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=158.3s)]
*  results, then tell me, how are we going to decide who is in power in this country? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=163.54s)]
*  What's the other mechanism we're going to use if it's not real election results? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=170.54s)]
*  Democracy is mortal. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=175.66s)]
*  It can be killed. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=177.45999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't go away by someone, you know, one day proclaiming we are no longer here by a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=178.85999999999999s)]
*  democracy. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=183.98s)]
*  It goes away when there stops being an expectation that we are governed by democratic means, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=184.98s)]
*  when there stops being an expectation that elections are how we decide who's in power. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=189.44s)]
*  The way you lose your democracy is by losing the expectation that we are participating [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=195.4s)]
*  in an election because all sides in that election plan to accept the result, right? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=202.7s)]
*  To go home if they lose and to go into office if they win. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=207.34s)]
*  Once we no longer expect that, we are no longer in a democratic system of government in many [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=210.88s)]
*  important respects. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=217.48s)]
*  Once one of the two major governing parties no longer believes elections are binding, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=220.0s)]
*  then in many important ways, the democracy ship has sailed because they are no longer [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=226.0s)]
*  competing on democratic grounds, right? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=230.72s)]
*  Once one of the two major parties is no longer pledging that they will abide by the election [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=236.64s)]
*  or lose, the democratic system of government is not threatened with harm. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=242.0s)]
*  It is wounded already. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=248.28s)]
*  Threats to a democracy are not a theoretical prospect that looms sometime in the future, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=252.0s)]
*  just like threats to the rule of law. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=256.56s)]
*  Threats to democracy are also here now. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=258.36s)]
*  Poll workers and election workers have been chased out of those jobs by the thousands [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=260.64s)]
*  by violence and harassment and threats that are already here and that have already done [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=264.52s)]
*  their work. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=268.24s)]
*  Who is going to stand up and say, okay, well, I'm capable, I'm brave, I'm willing to do [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=269.68s)]
*  something hard for my country this year and I can take one of those jobs, I can take one [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=276.32s)]
*  of those seats, I can drive people to the polls and door knock for a campaign that I [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=280.08s)]
*  wasn't planning on working for. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=285.64s)]
*  I will work at a polling place, right? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=288.2s)]
*  Who's going to stand up and do that? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=290.8s)]
*  Because thousands of experienced poll workers have been chased from their jobs because an [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=292.92s)]
*  anti-democratic movement in this country led by the former president has produced such [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=297.18s)]
*  an environment of threat and harassment and violence around those very low level jobs [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=302.98s)]
*  in the technical part of our democracy that those jobs are unfilled. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=309.14s)]
*  Who will fill those jobs? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=313.5s)]
*  Who will do that work? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=314.74s)]
*  It's not an esoteric thing. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=317.14s)]
*  It is a practical thing and the time is now. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=318.66s)]
*  It's here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=321.82s)]
*  And I think the other part of it is recognizing that there is a reason that this is all happening. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=325.5s)]
*  And this to me is the opposite of enervating. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=331.34s)]
*  To me this is energizing, understanding why it's happening, understand the sort of larger [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=333.42s)]
*  plot this is part of. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=338.54s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize winning historian Anne Applebaum is here with us tonight. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=340.86s)]
*  We're going to be speaking with her in just a few moments. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=343.66s)]
*  She's just written this in the Atlantic, which I think is really important. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=346.66s)]
*  The title is Democracy is Losing the Propaganda War. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=351.22s)]
*  Autocrats in China, Russia and other places around the world are now colluding with MAGA [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=356.14000000000004s)]
*  Republicans to discredit liberalism and freedom everywhere. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=360.74s)]
*  Applebaum writes that autocratic regimes have slowly turned their repressive mechanisms [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=366.14000000000004s)]
*  outward into the democratic world. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=371.54s)]
*  If people are naturally drawn to the image of human rights, to the language of democracy, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=374.34000000000003s)]
*  to the dream of freedom, then those concepts have to be poisoned. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=378.34s)]
*  That requires more than a political system that defends against liberal ideas. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=382.17999999999995s)]
*  It also requires an offensive plan, a narrative that damages the idea of democracy everywhere [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=387.09999999999997s)]
*  in the world and the tools to deliver it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=392.85999999999996s)]
*  She says, quote, here is a difficult truth. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=397.02s)]
*  A part of the American political spectrum is not merely a passive recipient of the combined [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=400.78s)]
*  authoritarian narratives that come from these authoritarian countries that are working to [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=405.26s)]
*  discredit democracy. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=409.26s)]
*  But a part of the American political spectrum is an active participant in creating and spreading [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=411.26s)]
*  these narratives. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=419.18s)]
*  Like the leaders of those authoritarian countries, the American MAGA right also wants Americans [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=421.18s)]
*  to believe that their democracy is degenerate, their elections illegitimate, their civilization [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=426.5s)]
*  dying. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=433.42s)]
*  The MAGA movement's leaders also have an interest in pumping nihilism and cynicism into the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=434.58000000000004s)]
*  brains of their fellow citizens and in convincing them that nothing they see is true. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=439.78000000000003s)]
*  Their goals are so similar that it is hard to distinguish between the online American [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=444.78000000000003s)]
*  alt-right and its foreign amplifiers, who have multiplied since the days when this was [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  solely a Russian project. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  One could call this a secret authoritarian plot to spread anti-democratic conspiracy [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=456.44s)]
*  theories, except that it's not a secret. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=461.76s)]
*  It's all visible right on the surface. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=464.68s)]
*  Authoritarian regimes working with Americans to discredit democracy, to undermine the credibility [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=467.71999999999997s)]
*  of democratic leaders, to mock the rule of law. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=473.32s)]
*  They do so with the goal of electing Trump, whose second presidency would damage the image [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  of democracy around the world, as well as the stability of democracy in America even [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=482.4s)]
*  further. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=488.2s)]
*  I'll speak with Anne Applebaum in just a moment. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=489.64s)]
*  I'll just say there is a reason why the damage to the rule of law in our country, the damage [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=493.92s)]
*  to democracy in our country, which we have already started living with, there's a reason [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=500.4s)]
*  why it is coincident with a rise in authoritarianism around the world. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=505.52s)]
*  And it's because we as a country are not immune to the same pro-authoritarian, anti-democratic [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=509.5s)]
*  blow through Europe and all over the rest of the world right now, too. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=515.3199999999999s)]
*  Our democracy is mortal, too, just like every other democracy in history has ever been. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=519.3199999999999s)]
*  Being real about the harm that has been done to us already, being clear-eyed about the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=525.12s)]
*  fact that we can see some of these same dynamics that work in other countries, tuning into [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=529.12s)]
*  the fact that the right under Donald Trump is admiring of and openly emulating the way [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=533.3199999999999s)]
*  other countries have destroyed their democracies, recognizing they are willingly part of this [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=538.58s)]
*  project, that to me is energizing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=544.68s)]
*  I feel like that at least should put some steel in our spine because it should tell [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  us the part that we have to play here. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=555.12s)]
*  It should at least give us real grounded practical expectations of where this is all going to [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjDxluLurPo&t=559.88s)]
