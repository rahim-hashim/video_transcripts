# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 14
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I)
*  Attorney General James is still trying to get President Trump and his adult [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=0.0s)]
*  children, Don Jr. and Ivanka, to sit for a deposition as part of her investigation. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=4.4s)]
*  And today, on Valentine's Day no less, we learned from new court documents that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=9.64s)]
*  President Trump's longtime accounting firm is ours, which helped Trump put [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  together those financial statements. That firm is breaking up with him. In a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=20.0s)]
*  letter to the Trump Organization dated last week, the accounting firm started [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=25.6s)]
*  by writing explicitly that all of the statements of financial condition it [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=29.52s)]
*  put together with Trump to evaluate his company's financial situation from 2011 [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=34.16s)]
*  to 2020, those should quote, no longer be relied upon. It continued, We have [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=39.28s)]
*  come to this conclusion based in part upon the filings made by the New York [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=46.68s)]
*  Attorney General, our own investigation and information received from internal [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=50.92s)]
*  and external sources. Due in part to our decision regarding the financial [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=55.68s)]
*  statements, as well as the totality of the circumstances, we have also reached [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=60.36s)]
*  the point that there is a non waivable conflict of interest with the Trump [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=65.08s)]
*  organization. As a result, we are not able to provide any new work product to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=70.64s)]
*  the Trump Organization, meaning that's it. Relationship over. The firm will [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=76.64s)]
*  not even finish Donald and Melania's taxes this year. And this is really [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=85.16s)]
*  saying something because Trump's past statements of financial condition were [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=90.52s)]
*  filled with many, many disclaimers to lower Mazar's risk. Like this one from [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=94.08s)]
*  the first paragraph of Trump's 2011 statement, quote, We have not audited or [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=100.16s)]
*  reviewed the accompanying financial statement and accordingly do not [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=104.84s)]
*  express an opinion or provide any assurance about whether the financial [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=108.24s)]
*  statement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=112.28s)]
*  in the United States of America. So Trump's accounting firm had already been [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=116.0s)]
*  hedging its cosign on Trump's financial statements for over a decade. And now [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=120.91999999999999s)]
*  the firm is going even further, saying it wants nothing to do with any of this. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=125.8s)]
*  They are out. They quit. Don't let the door hit you on the way out. And if [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=131.84s)]
*  you are the former president finding a replacement firm may not be easy, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=135.64s)]
*  according to various reports, the former president is somewhere in the ballpark [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=141.24s)]
*  of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Reports of that debt vary from [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=144.6s)]
*  $400 million to over a billion dollars. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=149.84s)]
*  Even if you were to give or take 200 million, that is still a lot of debt. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=154.74s)]
*  And this letter from his longtime accountant, very publicly bailing on the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=160.54s)]
*  former president, will likely make it very hard for him to find new partners [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  willing to refinance that debt or let him take on future loans. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=169.04s)]
*  I am not a lawyer and I'm sure not an accountant, but this all seems bad. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  What does it mean practically for Donald Trump and for the New York attorney [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  general's investigation into Trump's finances? Joining us now is Barbara [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=186.68s)]
*  McQuade, former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. Barbara, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=191.48s)]
*  thanks as always for joining us. Let's start first with this line from the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=194.92s)]
*  letter about Mazar's having a non-wavable conflict of interest against [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=199.48s)]
*  working with a Trump organization. Does that effectively mean that Mazar's is on [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=204.56s)]
*  the attorney general Letitia James side now? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=209.42s)]
*  You know, I don't know exactly what it means, but what it does say is, you know, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  in the law, when a lawyer wants to quit a client, they typically use words like [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=216.2s)]
*  irreconcilable differences. The relationship has broken down to the point [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=221.4s)]
*  that they can no longer serve them effectively. And I think that's what it [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=225.68s)]
*  means. But to talk about a conflict of interest goes a little above and beyond [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=229.52s)]
*  that and does suggest that you might be on the wrong side of the V in a lawsuit [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  when it's, for example, people of the state of New York versus Trump. So I [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=237.8s)]
*  don't know if it means they're cooperating, but I do think it means that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  they can no longer vouch for the reliability of financial documents they [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=244.52s)]
*  prepared on behalf of the Trump organization. You know, I think the phrase [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=248.84s)]
*  that comes to my mind is garbage in garbage out. And so it may be that they [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=253.84s)]
*  prepared financial documents based on the data they received, but they have [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=257.56s)]
*  now learned perhaps that that data was inaccurate and therefore the financial [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=262.36s)]
*  statements that they prepared utilizing that data are also inaccurate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=266.72s)]
*  Do we have a sense that if Mazar's is cooperating, we know that one of their [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=271.16s)]
*  officers has already testified to a grand jury that that could be problematic [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  for the Trump organization? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=280.24s)]
*  Oh, I think so. You know, an accountant has access to a lot of information, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  obviously, to prepare your tax records, to put together financial statements. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=286.48s)]
*  And so that could be very damning information. You know, one of the cases [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=291.8s)]
*  that comes to my mind, a case I watched covered for the show was the trial of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=296.12s)]
*  Paul Manafort. Remember, he had financial crimes that he was convicted of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=299.92s)]
*  bank fraud and tax cases, claims and other things. Some of the key witnesses [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  in his case were his accountants. And some of the things they testified about [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  were, he gave me information that I relied on in preparing these financial [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  documents. I have now learned that that information was false. And so because of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=318.32s)]
*  that, the documents that I produced was false. So in the same kind of way, I [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=323.04s)]
*  could imagine that Mazar's is cooperating with the attorney general. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=327.36s)]
*  They don't want to get crosswise with the government. They will produce documents [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=331.16s)]
*  that they believe comply with accounting principles. But if they learn that the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=335.8s)]
*  raw data that was used in those documents was wrong, I think you'll see [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=339.8s)]
*  them run from those documents, which appears to be what's happening here. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=343.32s)]
*  I feel like this is actually the textbook definition of running, right? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=346.44s)]
*  Don't pay any attention to the last decade of documents we gave you. I wonder [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=349.84s)]
*  to what extent should we expect this development to affect the criminal pro [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=354.12s)]
*  being led by the Manhattan D.A.'s attorney, Manhattan district attorney, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=359.32s)]
*  into Trump's finances? We know there are parallel probes, right? Is this going to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=362.55999999999995s)]
*  bleed over into that, the civil crime, the civil case into the criminal case? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=366.4s)]
*  I think it absolutely could. That case also depends on the same idea of [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=371.28s)]
*  fraudulent representations about Trump's financial worth. And so, you know, the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=376.67999999999995s)]
*  statements are typically that he inflated some of his assets when it [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=381.52s)]
*  suited him. If he was applying for a loan, if he was seeking insurance coverage, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  if he was looking for tax deductions, he would inflate to the tune, as you said, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  $200 million, overestimating the size of his apartment from 100 to 300,000 [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  square feet. Huge amounts of inflation of these assets. And then on other [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  occasions, when it suited him, like paying his tax bill, he would take the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  same assets and reduce their value. And so sometimes you can look objectively at [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  these documents and see, you know, in one year you claimed it was worth $200 [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=414.76s)]
*  million, and the next year you said it was $400 million. Some of those just [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=418.88s)]
*  don't add up on their face. And so I would imagine that not only are those [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=422.56s)]
*  the basis of these civil fraud claims, but could very well be the basis of [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  bank fraud or tax fraud from a criminal perspective in the Manhattan D.A.'s [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  investigation. It was February 2014. The autocratic pro-Russian ruler of Ukraine [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=436.56s)]
*  had just fled the country after being forced out of office by pro-democracy [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=443.88s)]
*  street protests. And in that confusing aftermath, soldiers began appearing in [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=448.6s)]
*  the southern Ukrainian province of Crimea. The soldiers had no identifying [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=454.92s)]
*  insignia. They wore plain green uniforms, and they came to be known as the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=459.84s)]
*  Little Green Men. Some of them stormed Crimea's regional parliament. They [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=464.88s)]
*  barricaded themselves inside and they raised the Russian flag over the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=470.08s)]
*  building. The next day, more of these green uniformed men seized airports in [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=474.2s)]
*  Crimea. Within a couple of weeks, the whole of Crimea was under the control of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=479.8s)]
*  these little green men. They were clearly pro-Russian. They spoke Russian, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  and they were heavily armed with Russian weapons. But Russian President Vladimir [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=489.96s)]
*  Putin insisted they were not Russian troops. He said they were local self-defense [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=495.2s)]
*  forces acting on their own. Hey, he couldn't help it if the people of Crimea [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=501.24s)]
*  liked Russia more than they liked the new pro-Western government in Ukraine. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  The confusion led to headlines like this one from the BBC. Russians, in quotation [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=511.52s)]
*  mark, occupied Crimea airports. So it was clear to everyone on the ground in [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=516.96s)]
*  Crimea that these were Russian soldiers in disguise, but the entire Russian [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=523.2800000000001s)]
*  government was denying from top to bottom that they were Russian soldiers. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=527.64s)]
*  NATO and the U.S. seemed kind of flummoxed about how to respond. I mean, how [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=532.6s)]
*  do you stop an invasion when you can't even get everyone to agree that an [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=537.32s)]
*  invasion is happening? Then Vice President Joe Biden flew to Poland to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=542.0400000000001s)]
*  reassure Eastern European allies that the U.S. had their back. By the time he [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=547.76s)]
*  got there, the occupation of Crimea was a done deal. The day Biden arrived, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=552.24s)]
*  Putin announced that Crimea was now part of Russia. Fast forward to today, as [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=558.04s)]
*  Russia once again menaces Ukraine, this time with 130,000 troops on its borders, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=564.76s)]
*  a number that is growing every day. And now President Biden, President Joe [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=570.24s)]
*  Biden apparently wants to make sure his administration does not repeat the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=575.0s)]
*  mistakes of 2014. According to a report this weekend in the New York Times, back [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=578.92s)]
*  then it wasn't that the U.S. government didn't know what Russia was up to. They [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=583.76s)]
*  just didn't tell anyone. Quote, the Biden administration is determined not to see [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=588.2s)]
*  a repeat of 2014 when NATO was confused and caught by surprise when Russian [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=594.08s)]
*  forces took over Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, largely unopposed. Senior [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  Obama administration officials recalled their frustration when the intelligence [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=604.48s)]
*  agencies would not allow the White House to tell NATO, let alone the public, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=608.4s)]
*  what Washington knew about Russia's moves. I can remember a dozen times when [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=613.16s)]
*  I thought our interests would be advanced if we just told the world what [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=618.28s)]
*  we knew, said Michael McFaul, who was the U.S. ambassador to Russia when it [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=621.84s)]
*  annexed Crimea. And so now today we have the opposite. The U.S. government [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=625.9599999999999s)]
*  declassifying and publicizing at a breakneck pace what it says it knows [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=632.8399999999999s)]
*  about Russia's plans from the movements of Russia's forces to its alleged plans [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  to launch false flag operations to new urgent warnings that an invasion could [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=643.4799999999999s)]

*  U.S. and Russia. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=661.3199999999999s)]
*  Today is the first day of early voting in Texas for the primaries being held on [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=664.6s)]
*  March 1st. This is the first election in which Texas will be able to test its [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=669.8399999999999s)]
*  brand new and highly restrictive voting law. And already those new I.D. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=675.04s)]
*  number requirements are creating major roadblocks for Texans who would like to [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=680.52s)]
*  vote. Harris County is the most populous county in the state, home to the city of [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=685.9599999999999s)]
*  Houston. Already this year, Houston has had to reject about 40% of all mail in [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=690.92s)]
*  ballot applications because they were missing a proper I.D. number. This is [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=698.28s)]
*  happening all over the state. The number of mail in ballot applications rejected [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=703.8399999999999s)]
*  from Dallas County is as high as 28% and the rejection rate is 30% over in [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=708.24s)]
*  Williamson County, which includes the Austin suburbs. The issue here is not [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=715.52s)]
*  just that some voters are leaving this section blank or that they don't [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=720.56s)]
*  understand the directions. In a lot of cases, the problem is on the Texas end. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=723.88s)]
*  CNN spoke with a Texas voter who tried to apply for a mail in ballot. She [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=729.2399999999999s)]
*  provided her Texas driver's license number like the new law requires, but her [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=734.8s)]
*  application was denied because the number on her current license didn't [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=739.16s)]
*  match the one Texas had on file for her, the one she used 46 years ago when she [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=744.36s)]
*  moved to the Houston area. The point of this law passed by Republicans in Texas [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=751.28s)]
*  was to make it harder and more difficult to vote. And so far, it appears to be [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=756.44s)]
*  working. The top elections official in Texas's biggest county is named Isabel [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=761.96s)]
*  Longoria. She says, quote, We are seeing in real time voters votes being rejected. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=766.5600000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Isabel Longoria, the elections administrator in Harris [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=774.2s)]
*  County, Texas. Thank you so much for being here. Miss Longoria, what? What [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=778.12s)]
*  are you hearing from voters as they process this new law? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=782.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm hearing a lot of confusion and fear questions being asked of what does this [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=788.4s)]
*  mean for my mail ballot? If my application gets rejected this year, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=792.52s)]
*  doesn't mean it gets rejected next time. What does this mean not only for the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=796.88s)]
*  primaries, but for the general? And ultimately, how can I fix this so I [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=800.34s)]
*  don't have this problem again? And this is just the tip of the iceberg. As we [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=804.1800000000001s)]
*  start early voting in person in Texas today, that's one of the big question [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=807.76s)]
*  marks for us. Election officials is what happens to those in person voters? Now [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=811.46s)]
*  we're gonna see the same thing to that end about how to fix the applications. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=815.6600000000001s)]
*  Is there a curative process? Are there resources to help people fix these [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=819.5s)]
*  applications so they can in fact get mail in ballots? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=823.98s)]
*  Yes and no. For counties as big as Harris County, we actually have the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=827.14s)]
*  staff to double up our call centers so that we can answer all the calls. In [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=830.38s)]
*  January, we got 8000 calls to our call center, 5000 of which were just for mail [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=835.14s)]
*  ballots to put into perspective in November for our local elections. We [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=840.38s)]
*  had maybe 5000 calls for the entire month for everything. So we're seeing [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=843.78s)]
*  an increase in calls in increase on pressure from local counties to meet [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=848.02s)]
*  the demands again with those call centers with our outreach efforts. But [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=851.66s)]
*  it's a layering of issues. Yes, there's an online database to cure your mail [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=855.5400000000001s)]
*  ballots from the Secretary of State, but you have to put in both of your ID [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=859.74s)]
*  numbers to even get into the database. So if you only have one ID number, you [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=864.1800000000001s)]
*  can't even get into the state's database to cure your mail ballot. And so like [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=868.1800000000001s)]
*  I said, it's a death by 1000 cuts. It's a layering of this new election laws, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=871.98s)]
*  the confusion, the fear, the paperwork for the application or from the mail [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=875.98s)]
*  ballot paperwork for curing. You've got to ask yourselves, are you really [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=880.02s)]
*  tearing down barriers to help voters or you're just putting up more roadblocks? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=883.7800000000001s)]
*  One, I mean, it bears mentioning that it's not just Democrats who want to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=888.0600000000001s)]
*  make ballots, right? I mean, this is affecting Texas voters writ large [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=891.7s)]
*  generally Democrats, Republicans, independents. Is there a sense from the [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=895.5s)]
*  Republicans that were in charge of drafting this new law and largely [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=899.5400000000001s)]
*  passing it that they have made a mistake and that things need to change? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=902.5400000000001s)]
*  Are they trying to devote more resources? I mean, to what degree are [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=906.14s)]
*  people realizing the problems that they've created? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=909.26s)]
*  The big message I'm getting from the state right now as well, it's a [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=913.7800000000001s)]
*  learning curve. Just sit and wait. But unfortunately, when it comes to votes, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=916.38s)]
*  there is no learning curve, right? That is someone's vote being lost. Period. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=919.98s)]
*  That should never be a learning curve. That shouldn't be said flippantly. And [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=924.1s)]
*  that's my biggest concern right now is we election officials raised this last [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=928.3000000000001s)]
*  year when the election ball bills were being passed. These were the well, well, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=932.7s)]
*  well predicted consequences of these actions. And yet we're still seeing this. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=936.86s)]
*  Oh, well, it'll get better over time mentality, which if you didn't believe [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=941.02s)]
*  us then please believe us now. This isn't getting better. This is something [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=945.58s)]
*  baked into the laws baked into the statutes that we're gonna see. Yes, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=949.54s)]
*  rejection rates now, but yes, leading into the November midterms as well. You [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=953.0600000000001s)]
*  know, the more you try and take people's right to vote away, sometimes [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=957.1s)]
*  the harder they fight for. And I just wonder, is the frustration being [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=960.94s)]
*  coupled with determination to get this right? I mean, what what anecdotally [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=964.78s)]
*  can you share with us behind the frustration? Are people doubling down on [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=969.38s)]
*  their efforts or people in fact actually just giving up? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=972.7800000000001s)]
*  It's a really interesting question. First, we're gonna see how many [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=976.48s)]
*  applications that we've sent back actually get cured. Same with those mail [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=979.1800000000001s)]
*  ballots. How many people actually take the step to fix or cure their mail [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=982.7800000000001s)]
*  ballots and how many people actually come bone in person if the mail ballot [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=986.1800000000001s)]
*  falls through. We're on just day one here. I've heard from my staff that [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=989.62s)]
*  perhaps our in person voting is a little higher than four years ago. That's [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=993.1s)]
*  hopeful. But I think for some folks who when we were election officials were [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=997.14s)]
*  talking about the laws this summer and it seems so theoretical, you know, Oh, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1001.34s)]
*  you're just fear mongering. Oh, that's never gonna happen. Now we're seeing the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1005.02s)]
*  real life consequences. And I'll say that wakes people up very quickly when [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1008.38s)]
*  you get a call from my office saying, well, because of the state laws, we have [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1011.5600000000001s)]
*  to reject your mail ballot and they're saying, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, I never thought [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1014.26s)]
*  this would happen to me. You know, I think you're right. Yeah, it is [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1017.38s)]
*  happening and it is happening now in Texas. Isabel Longoria, elections [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1021.38s)]
*  administrator in Harris County, Texas. Thank you for being here and thank you [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1024.8799999999999s)]
*  for all you're doing to keep democracy moving. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1028.08s)]
*  Joining us now live from the port city of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine is NBC's [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1032.1799999999998s)]
*  chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel. Richard, great reporting. Thank [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1037.0s)]
*  you for being with us. I know it is very early over there. You are about 30 [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1040.76s)]
*  miles from the Russian border and even closer to Kremlin back separatists. What [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1045.1599999999999s)]
*  can you tell us about the mood on the ground? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1049.1999999999998s)]
*  So the mood here where I am is quite specific and unique. I'll get to that in [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1051.08s)]
*  a second, but I think the mood across Ukraine is one of despair. People are [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1055.76s)]
*  afraid. People are angry at what they feel is Russia's inability to let go. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1061.9199999999998s)]
*  You went through some of the history and I think it's really important. This [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1069.72s)]
*  country has been an independent country from the Soviet Union. It's been a [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1074.6799999999998s)]
*  independent country from the Soviet Union, from Russia's sphere of influence [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1078.96s)]
*  since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. And it has changed profoundly in [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1082.24s)]
*  the last three decades. Culturally, they've embraced their Ukrainian language [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1086.76s)]
*  much more, which was highly restricted. And politically, they've changed. And [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1092.4s)]
*  particularly in the last eight years, they've really been racing toward [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1097.6s)]
*  democracy. And they began with a bang out of the starting gate in Maidan, in [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1100.64s)]
*  the Maidan revolution in 2014, when Joe Biden was vice president. And they have [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1107.72s)]
*  been changing their political orientation more toward Europe, more [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1113.72s)]
*  toward NATO over the last eight years. And now it feels that Putin is saying [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1118.72s)]
*  not so fast. You don't get to go away. You don't get to deny that previous [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1124.44s)]
*  history. You come right back into the fold. So there is this feeling that [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1129.2s)]
*  Russia won't let them out of this relationship and move on. Now, here where [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1134.8s)]
*  I am, very specifically, there is somewhat of a different sentiment. I am [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCgVKFQOD0I&t=1139.92s)]
