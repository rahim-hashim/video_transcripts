# New Subpoenas Show Focus On Trump Campaign Officials In Fake Elector Scheme
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I)
*  Now today, the January 6 investigation has issued a new batch of six subpoenas, again [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=0.0s)]
*  focused on the fake electors scheme. The six include two elected state officials in Pennsylvania [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=6.8s)]
*  and Arizona, as well as the chair of the Arizona Republican Party. But two of the subpoenas were [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  also sent to the director and deputy director of Election Day Operations for Trump's 2020 campaign. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=20.0s)]
*  In their subpoena to Michael Roman, who served as the director of Election Day Operations, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  the investigators wrote, quote, The Select Committee is in possession of communications [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=32.0s)]
*  reflecting your involvement in a coordinated strategy to contact Republican members of state [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=36.4s)]
*  legislatures in certain states that former President Trump had lost and urge them to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=41.44s)]
*  reclaim their authority by sending an alternate slate of electors, one that would support former [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  President Trump. It appears that you helped direct the Trump campaign staffers participating [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=52.24s)]
*  in this effort. Joining us now is California Congressman and member of the January 6 investigation, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=58.24s)]
*  Pete Aguilar. Congressman, thank you for joining us. I know you've been busy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=64.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Alex. We have seen public reporting in the last couple days and today that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=69.12s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani oversaw this fake electors scheme. And today your investigation revealed it has [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=73.76s)]
*  the evidence that the director and deputy director of Election Day Operations for the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=80.72s)]
*  Trump campaign were heavily involved in this game. Do you expect those individuals to testify [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=84.72s)]
*  and provide documents to the committee? Well, it's a two pronged sword there. We want both the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=91.12s)]
*  production of documents as well as their testimony. That's what we've sought out of each individual [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=98.56s)]
*  who has received a subpoena. That's our expectation. And so we will work with them to achieve that. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=104.0s)]
*  Ultimately, this is about getting to the truth. And we feel that these six individuals and those [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=110.8s)]
*  two who had an effort, who played a role in coordinating this effort with the states directly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  have something to share. And so we want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to seek [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  the truth here. And that means talking to these two individuals and asking them for document [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=127.2s)]
*  production. So you're optimistic that they'll cooperate? Well, it's our hope that anybody who [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=131.2s)]
*  receives a lawful subpoena cooperates. Although some clearly in the former president's orbit [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=136.4s)]
*  have chosen to take a different path with consequences, it's always our expectation. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  And we will continue to work in good faith to make sure that we seek these documents and get [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  this testimony. Do you feel at this point that you have a firm sense of who is ultimately [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=152.88s)]
*  responsible for this fake electors scheme? We feel that we're making significant progress. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  But ultimately, what your reporting shows is just the depths to which this is gone and the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=164.8s)]
*  silencing of millions of votes that this campaign official was asking these states by silencing these [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=172.8s)]
*  votes and flipping a lawful election. That's exactly what they were doing. And so to the extent [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  that they were using the government machinery around them to execute this strategy, that's what [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=186.4s)]
*  we want to seek to get to. How high did this go? Who was involved? Those are the things that we [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=193.12s)]
*  feel are important to seek at this point. And we feel that these two individuals, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=199.76s)]
*  specifically within the Trump campaign, will shed some light on those details for us. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=204.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QnBt6fbQ8I&t=223.12s)]
