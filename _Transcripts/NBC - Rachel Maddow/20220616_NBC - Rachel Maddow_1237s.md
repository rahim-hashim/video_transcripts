# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: June 15
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI)
*  Today, when the January 6th investigation released shocking video of a Republican congressman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=0.0s)]
*  named Barry Loudermilk leading an hours-long tour of all the House office buildings the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=5.44s)]
*  day before the Capitol attack, a tour, it turns out, for multiple people who participated [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=11.0s)]
*  in the events of January 6th the next day, well, that was a vindication of sorts for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=15.82s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman Mikey Sherrill of New Jersey. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=21.2s)]
*  It was Congresswoman Sherrill who raised the alarm more than a year ago, right after the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=24.88s)]
*  attack, when she said she saw Republican members of Congress leading tours like that for people [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=28.24s)]
*  who then participated in the attack on the Capitol the following day. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  Congresswoman Sherrill has been rabidly criticized by Republicans, including Congressman Loudermilk, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=37.599999999999994s)]
*  for having raised these allegations. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=42.86s)]
*  They claimed these allegations were definitely false. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=44.68s)]
*  We now know what she said was absolutely and specifically true. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=47.5s)]
*  Tonight, Congresswoman Sherrill has released this statement that says in part, quote, I've [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=51.599999999999994s)]
*  served our country as a federal prosecutor and know how important it is to investigate [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=55.96s)]
*  and collect evidence and to let that process run its course. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  The video evidence released today by the bipartisan January 6th committee, combined with the constantly [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=62.8s)]
*  shifting narrative and misdirection from Representatives Barry Loudermilk and Rodney Davis, call into [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=67.24s)]
*  question their dedication to our common oath as members of Congress. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=73.0s)]
*  Joining us now live is Democratic Congresswoman Mikey Sherrill of New Jersey. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=78.52s)]
*  Congresswoman, thank you so much for making time to be here tonight. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=81.8s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=85.12s)]
*  I just spoke with your colleague, Zoe Lofgren, who's a member of the January 6th investigation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=86.12s)]
*  I'm going to ask you the same question I asked her, which is, have I misstated any of this? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  Did I get any of this wrong? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  Or is there any big piece of this that our viewers should understand that I haven't explained? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  No, Rachel, this is, as you said, a story you've been following really from the beginning [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  of it, and I think you've tracked it quite well. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=106.72s)]
*  What is your reaction today to this video being released by the January 6th investigation? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=109.88s)]
*  When I saw this today, my thought was, this is what Congresswoman Sherrill saw. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  This is what concerned her. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=121.24s)]
*  Was the video they released today in fact what you saw and what caused you to set off [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  those red flags? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=126.8s)]
*  Well, Rachel, you know, I've talked to people about the fact that as a Navy helicopter pilot, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=128.48s)]
*  we've been through training to recognize suspicious things. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=136.44s)]
*  As a former federal prosecutor, of course, I believe deeply that if you see things like [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=139.96s)]
*  this, if there's an investigation going on, you have to come forward. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=145.76s)]
*  It's your duty to come forward to talk about this stuff. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  As I was talking about how odd it was that the Capitol complex was closed and there were [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=153.24s)]
*  visitors there, and they just were doing odd things. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=157.6s)]
*  They were in places they should not have been acting in a suspicious way, especially in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=160.0s)]
*  light of the attack on January 6th. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=166.0s)]
*  I think what this video shows is, yes, what I was talking about. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=168.28s)]
*  In fact, quite a few members have come out and former members as well saying, this is [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=172.8s)]
*  not what tours look like. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=178.44s)]
*  These are not places you take tours. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=181.24s)]
*  That is what I was highlighting and that's what I had wanted the January 6th committee [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=184.44s)]
*  to investigate. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=188.8s)]
*  Certainly, we see some of the results of that investigation today. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=189.8s)]
*  Do you know if there were more tours like this, either other tours led by Congressman [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=194.68s)]
*  Laudermilk or others led by other members? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  That is not the only group that I saw. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=203.62s)]
*  I saw groups down there and I think what we've asked the January 6th committee to do is to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=207.08s)]
*  understand what those people were doing in the Capitol complex. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=211.88s)]
*  That's what we asked really the sergeant in arms to get to the bottom of what was going [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=215.56s)]
*  on. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=221.0s)]
*  I've seen the January 6th committee working to do just that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=222.0s)]
*  You know, Rachel, I mentioned I was a helicopter pilot and a federal prosecutor, but I don't [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=226.68s)]
*  think it takes that to come forward in an investigation when the Capitol has been attacked, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=232.32s)]
*  when the former president tried to stay in office despite the will of the American people. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=239.16s)]
*  If you have evidence in that situation, if you've taken an oath to the Constitution [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=244.0s)]
*  of the United States, you have a duty to come forward. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=249.6s)]
*  I think what's so, remains shocking to me is the constantly shifting narrative, the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=252.72s)]
*  misdirection of Representative Laudermilk and Representative Davis. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=260.0s)]
*  Then to see this video, to see exactly what he was doing and knew that he had done and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=264.92s)]
*  his failure to come forward, his failure to talk to the committee, I really think is, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=274.24s)]
*  again, just really shocking to me. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=280.84s)]
*  As you said in your statement tonight, it calls into question their dedication to our [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  common oath as members of Congress. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=287.08s)]
*  That's a serious way to put it, but I understand your reasoning. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=290.76s)]
*  Congressman Mikey Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, I really appreciate your time tonight [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=293.12s)]
*  as we continue to stay on this story. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=297.32s)]
*  Who knew it would have evolved like this? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  The consequences of former President Trump's claims that he won't respect election results, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=303.76s)]
*  the consequences of that continue to be felt all around the country, just all over the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=314.84s)]
*  place. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=318.76s)]
*  The latest, weirdest consequence of that is happening right now in the great state of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=319.76s)]
*  New Mexico. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=322.56s)]
*  Where in one county, the three Republican county commissioners are refusing to certify [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=323.56s)]
*  the election results in their county from this month's primaries. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  The commissioners haven't raised any actual concerns about anything going wrong in those [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=331.48s)]
*  elections. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=335.16s)]
*  They just don't want to certify the election results because they don't feel good about [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=336.16s)]
*  it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=340.76s)]
*  New Mexico's secretary of state stepped in and brought a lawsuit to the state Supreme [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  Court yesterday. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=346.1s)]
*  Today, the state Supreme Court ordered those county commissioners that they need to certify [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=347.1s)]
*  the election results by Friday. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=351.74s)]
*  One of the commissioners has already suggested that she'll laugh off any such order from [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=354.1s)]
*  a court, saying, what, you're going to put me in prison? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=358.04s)]
*  The question is, what does happen if they continue to refuse to obey the state Supreme [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=361.36s)]
*  Court and what happens to the votes of all those people who voted in New Mexico? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=365.26s)]
*  Joining us now is New Mexico's secretary of state, Maggie Toulouse Oliver. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=370.2s)]
*  Madam Secretary, thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=373.40000000000003s)]
*  It's a pleasure to have you here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=375.56s)]
*  Oh, I'm happy to be here, Rachel. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=376.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=379.24s)]
*  Have I explained any of this wrong? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=380.24s)]
*  I am a little bit new to this story. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=382.04s)]
*  I've been reading local coverage and that's pretty much how I understand it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=383.64s)]
*  But tell me if I've missed out anything important. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=386.6s)]
*  No, it's a very cut and dried situation. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=389.68s)]
*  There is a mandatory duty that the county commission has to review the results, the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=392.44s)]
*  report from the county clerk from our primary election last week. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=398.56s)]
*  They're welcome to ask questions. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=403.08s)]
*  There's even some limited authority for them to bring in a precinct board, ask them questions [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=405.14s)]
*  if there's any concerns about the accuracy of the results. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=410.68s)]
*  Of course, they've chosen to do none of that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=414.59999999999997s)]
*  And they based their unlawful action not to certify the election on, as you, I think, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=417.48s)]
*  have accurately summarized, their feelings about the election machines. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=423.44s)]
*  And that is not within the context of the law, within the scope of their authority. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  And quite frankly, you know, I think what we're looking at is a concern for a democratic, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  a breakdown of our democracy and a breakdown of the process moving forward if they don't [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  do the right thing and what the Supreme Court has ordered them to do. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=443.6s)]
*  So the Supreme Court has ordered them to certify these election results. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=447.40000000000003s)]
*  We don't yet know what the response from the commissioners will be to that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=451.08000000000004s)]
*  I will note that you raised the prospect in the press release announcing that you were [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  taking this writ to the Supreme Court over this matter. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=459.2s)]
*  You raised the prospect that there could potentially be a criminal referral to the state attorney [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  general's office in terms of these county commissioners violating their oaths of office. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=466.64s)]
*  When one of these commissioners sort of laughed off the prospect of complying with a court [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=473.0s)]
*  order here saying, what are you going to do? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=477.16s)]
*  Put me in prison. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=478.72s)]
*  I think she thought that was a ridiculous prospect, but it sounds like that might not [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=479.72s)]
*  be a ridiculous prospect. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=482.6s)]
*  I don't think it is ridiculous. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=485.12s)]
*  We are making that referral to the attorney general. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=487.04s)]
*  This commission has taken a number of unlawful actions over the course of the last couple [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  of weeks. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=495.12s)]
*  They took a vote, which is ultimately symbolic, but to ban the state certified voting systems [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=496.12s)]
*  in their county. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=502.28000000000003s)]
*  They took a vote to remove certified monitored containers to receive absentee ballots or [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=503.4s)]
*  mail-in ballots, which is also counter to state law. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=510.2s)]
*  And then they ordered or were attempting to order a hand recount of the results. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=513.88s)]
*  And none of those are provided for in state law. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=519.36s)]
*  Now, mind you, the irony of this entire situation is that if they certify the results, there [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=522.0s)]
*  are a number of processes that can then take place. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=528.4399999999999s)]
*  And particularly for candidates who may have questions about the outcome of the election, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=530.88s)]
*  we can undertake recounts, we can undertake re-checks of the voting system, but unless [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  and until this commission and their capacity as the canvassing board does their mandatory [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=540.52s)]
*  duty, we can't do any of that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=546.0s)]
*  And so we have made that referral or we're going to be making that referral shortly. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=548.28s)]
*  And quite frankly, criminal prosecution is on the list as well as removal from office [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=553.56s)]
*  for these commissioners who are violating the law. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=558.4399999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=560.88s)]
*  New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Chalouse Oliver, I'm sure you never anticipated your [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=561.88s)]
*  duties as Secretary of State requiring this kind of action, but here you are. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=566.4399999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much for helping us understand it tonight. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=571.4s)]
*  Please stay in touch with us about this story as it moves forward. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=573.54s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=577.3199999999999s)]
*  Today, the January 6th investigators released this, released video and still images of Republican [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=584.4s)]
*  Congressman Barry Loudermilk, in fact, leading that group on an hours long tour of all three [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=591.24s)]
*  house office buildings on January 5th. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  Hours in all three office buildings where members of Congress have their offices. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=602.76s)]
*  And one member of the group strangely takes pictures of things that tourists don't typically [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=607.36s)]
*  take pictures of. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=612.0s)]
*  Security checkpoints and hallways and stairways. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=613.32s)]
*  We know that a member of the tour took this picture of the office nameplate outside Jerry [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=617.64s)]
*  Nadler's office. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=622.0s)]
*  Also this picture of what appears to be a directory listing of Democratic members from [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=623.76s)]
*  the Judiciary Committee, including their photos. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=627.6s)]
*  Multiple members of this tour group led by Congressman Loudermilk apparently photographed [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=631.06s)]
*  the entrance of a tunnel that leads from the Rayburn House Office Building right into the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=635.12s)]
*  United States Capitol. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=640.18s)]
*  Why are they all taking pictures of the tunnel? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=641.4s)]
*  The committee says that multiple participants from Barry Loudermilk's tour, including the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=644.38s)]
*  man who was taking photos of the security checkpoints and the hallways, the January [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=648.52s)]
*  6th investigators say that man and others from the tour then did participate in the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=652.92s)]
*  January 6th events the following day. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=658.24s)]
*  In fact, the man who was taking the odd pictures of the security checkpoints and the hallways [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  and the stairways, according to the investigation, he shot this video for Facebook Live on January [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  in which he interacts with a person who he calls our fearless leader. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=671.4799999999999s)]
*  The man shows off how he had modified his flagpole to put what appears to be something sharp [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=674.4799999999999s)]
*  at the tip of it, or maybe he's just sharpened to the tip of the pole itself to use it like [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=679.3199999999999s)]
*  a spear. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=683.0999999999999s)]
*  The man says it's for a certain person and the man shooting the video, the man from Congressman [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=684.26s)]
*  Loudermilk's tour then says, yeah, that's for somebody special. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  And he mimes sort of jabbing it into someone. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=692.5s)]
*  The man from Loudermilk's tour then says on the video that they're coming for Jerry Nadler. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=696.84s)]
*  He repeats Jerry Nadler's name, Congressman Nadler's name a couple of different times. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=702.36s)]
*  He says they're coming for Jerry Nadler and Chuck Schumer and AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  and also Nancy Pelosi. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=711.44s)]
*  He then specifically threatens Pelosi. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=712.94s)]
*  He seems to be threatening that he's going to tear out her hair if he gets his hands [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  on her. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=718.32s)]
*  The implication of this release from the January 6th investigation today is that members of [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=719.6s)]
*  January 6th mob, including this man who got help in his task knowingly or unknowingly [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=724.16s)]
*  from Congressman Barry Loudermilk, they apparently prepped and did reconnaissance not just generically [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=732.36s)]
*  for targeting of the Capitol the next day, but for knowing their way around the building, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=738.4s)]
*  the buildings, excuse me, where members of Congress have their actual offices. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=743.04s)]
*  In this guy's case, based on his comments the next day, that was apparently so as to [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=747.28s)]
*  find and menace and potentially attack individual members who he was looking for the next day [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=751.32s)]
*  after having visited where they have their offices the previous day thanks to Congressman [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=760.5200000000001s)]
*  Loudermilk. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=763.8000000000001s)]
*  The man photographs the nameplate outside Jerry Nadler's office on January 5th after [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  Congressman Loudermilk's tour shows him there and then the next day he's marching toward [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=769.5600000000001s)]
*  the Capitol screaming repeatedly about how he's going to go get Jerry Nadler. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=773.36s)]
*  So what does this mean? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=780.0400000000001s)]
*  Number one, it means that the Democrats led by Mikey Sherrill who raised the alarm that [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=781.76s)]
*  this had happened on January 5th, they were apparently right. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=785.52s)]
*  Number two, interestingly, the committee has apparently interviewed the guy and has photos [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=789.0s)]
*  from his phone that he took during this tour of the House Office buildings on January 5th. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=794.0799999999999s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=798.64s)]
*  We should note that it appears the committee therefore knows who he is. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=799.64s)]
*  They have identified him and indeed contacted him. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=803.9599999999999s)]
*  But we should also note that as far as we know, he has not been arrested or charged [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=806.9599999999999s)]
*  with anything related to the attack. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=810.0s)]
*  Number three, I think we have to ask what the heck with the Capitol police letter sent [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=813.16s)]
*  earlier this week saying, yeah, yeah, we looked into it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=818.32s)]
*  It all seems fine to us. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=820.56s)]
*  They said explicitly in their letter that the tour didn't go into the tunnels between [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=822.16s)]
*  the office buildings in the Capitol and didn't go into the Capitol itself. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=826.4s)]
*  Well the committee shows in fact that the tour included showing off the tunnels and [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=829.92s)]
*  members of the tour taking pictures of the entrances to the tunnels, which is what you'd [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=834.2s)]
*  need to get from those office buildings into the Capitol building. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=839.28s)]
*  Did the Capitol police actually look into this and why did they screw this up so badly [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=843.04s)]
*  in their public statement about this event? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=847.5600000000001s)]
*  But finally, and perhaps most importantly, this is new information about the deliberate [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=850.72s)]
*  targeting of individual members of Congress. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=856.28s)]
*  On January 6th, we previously had video of dudes yelling Nancy Nancy while they hunted [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=858.6s)]
*  for Nancy Pelosi's office. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=863.88s)]
*  We of course have all seen the haunting footage of huge numbers of people in the crowd saying [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=865.36s)]
*  hang Mike Pence, hang Mike Pence. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=869.8000000000001s)]
*  We have the fact that the rioters in fact were able to find one of the offices for Nancy [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=872.52s)]
*  Pelosi and that office was in fact ransacked. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=876.6800000000001s)]
*  But now we've got this new video where, you know, as the dude is advancing on the Capitol, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=879.32s)]
*  he's talking to a guy with a spear made out of the flagpole about how they're going to [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=883.6s)]
*  use that on a certain someone and then they name individual lawmakers that he says he's [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=887.64s)]
*  coming for Pelosi, Nadler, Schumer, Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=892.24s)]
*  And yes, in the abstract, maybe that sounds like a weird guy fantasizing while he stomps [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=896.84s)]
*  around on the National Mall. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=901.1600000000001s)]
*  But now with context, we know that that same guy the previous day with help from a Republican [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=903.26s)]
*  congressman was apparently apparently casing the office building where those members in [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=908.0s)]
*  fact had their offices documenting the stairways, the hallways, the security checkpoints and [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=912.58s)]
*  how you might use that underground tunnel to get from that house office building into [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=916.98s)]
*  the Capitol itself, taking pictures of Nadler's office door, potentially mapping the way to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=921.2s)]
*  get to individual congressional offices and also into the Capitol. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=925.84s)]
*  Thanks for that, Congressman Barry Loudermilk. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=931.44s)]
*  Thanks for that very much. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=933.48s)]
*  Why did you deny ever giving that tour until you were caught for it? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=934.88s)]
*  And what did you know about the intentions of the people who participated in that tour? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=940.22s)]
*  When again, the Capitol complex was closed to tours. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=944.76s)]
*  And what did you think the following day on January 6th, given what happened at the Capitol, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=949.56s)]
*  when you knew that you had given a tour the previous day and when Democratic members of [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  Congress raised concerns about those reconnaissance tours having been given? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=960.6s)]
*  Why didn't you go to the police then? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=965.12s)]
*  Sir, why won't you go to the committee to talk about this now? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=966.92s)]
*  Joining us now is California congresswoman, member of the January 6th investigation, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=972.4399999999999s)]
*  Zoe Loughran. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=975.52s)]
*  Congresswoman Loughran, it's a real pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=976.52s)]
*  Thanks very much for being here. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=979.4s)]
*  Sure. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=981.4s)]
*  Good to be here, Rachel. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=982.4s)]
*  Let me just give you a chance to correct me if I explained any of that wrongly. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=984.72s)]
*  That's how I understand it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=988.36s)]
*  We've been following this for more than a year now. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=989.48s)]
*  Did I get any of that the wrong way around? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=991.52s)]
*  No, I think you've got it right. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=993.64s)]
*  Bonnie Davis is the ranking member of the House Administration Committee that I chair. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1000.44s)]
*  He and Mr. Loudermilk, who also serves on the House Administration Committee, had demanded [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1005.5200000000001s)]
*  the release of footage and claimed that they had seen all of the videos and there was nothing [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1011.4000000000001s)]
*  there, no one with a MAGA hat. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1018.08s)]
*  When we found the videos of Mr. Loudermilk leading a tour, we did ask him to come in. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1021.48s)]
*  We didn't accuse him of anything. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1029.16s)]
*  We just asked him to come in and talk to us and he refused to do it. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1030.48s)]
*  And then, of course, we got this weird letter from the Capitol Police Chief and we thought, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1035.68s)]
*  well, you know, we were going to show him this video, Mr. Loudermilk, privately and [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1044.16s)]
*  ask him about it. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1048.52s)]
*  So now he has a copy of it, as does the rest of the public. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1050.08s)]
*  We'd still like to hear from him. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1054.64s)]
*  Are we right to surmise? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1057.82s)]
*  Am I right to surmise tonight that you and the other investigators have confirmed the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1058.86s)]
*  identity of the person who's seen on that tour taking pictures in the House Office buildings [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1063.46s)]
*  and that that is the same person who's heard making those threats against members of Congress [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1068.3799999999999s)]
*  at the Capitol attack the next day? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1073.1799999999998s)]
*  You know for sure that that's the same person? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1074.62s)]
*  It's my understanding, yes. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1076.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1079.46s)]
*  Congressman Loudermilk said these were constituents from Georgia. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1080.46s)]
*  He said they were not members of the mob. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1084.4199999999998s)]
*  You have confirmed that one member of the tour participated in the events of January 6th. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1086.86s)]
*  How does this fit into the overall investigation that you and your colleagues are conducting? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1094.58s)]
*  I mean, I think when Mikey Sherrill and colleagues raised these concerns at the beginning, I [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1100.3799999999999s)]
*  think it sent a chill down the collective spine of the nation with the idea that some [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1104.62s)]
*  members of Congress might knowingly have abetted people who are participating in the January [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1109.4199999999998s)]
*  6th events in trying to hunt down individual members of Congress and menace them more effectively. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1114.6999999999998s)]
*  That's the scary implication here. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1120.26s)]
*  Is that in fact what you believe you have stumbled upon? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1122.06s)]
*  Well, we don't know that. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1125.22s)]
*  I mean, we have not accused Representative Loudermilk of that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1127.02s)]
*  We said we wanted to talk to him. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1130.3s)]
*  That he won't talk to us is concerning to me. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1133.82s)]
*  Obviously, he led a tour. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1137.54s)]
*  I mean, they took video of the tunnel from the Rayburn building to the Capitol. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1141.1s)]
*  That was the same tunnel. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1148.82s)]
*  The next day, I was evacuated through that tunnel from the House floor. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1150.5s)]
*  They took video of the stairwell that led into the Ways and Means Committee room where [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1155.06s)]
*  like a hundred or so members of Congress were sheltered in place after the evacuation from [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1163.58s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1170.62s)]
*  So we'd like to know about this. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1171.62s)]
*  And, you know, to say he actually filed an ethics complaint, that was bizarre when he [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1173.1399999999999s)]
*  must have. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1180.1399999999999s)]
*  He knew he himself led a tour. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1181.1399999999999s)]
*  And let's remember that the Capitol was completely closed to the public because of the COVID. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1185.1799999999998s)]
*  One of the Capitol Police told me yesterday that they were told that they couldn't even [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1192.06s)]
*  bring their own families into the Capitol complex. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1196.3799999999999s)]
*  It's completely closed. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1199.7s)]
*  California congresswoman, member of the January 6 investigation, Zoe Lofgren, we look forward [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1202.26s)]
*  to tomorrow's hearing. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1206.26s)]
*  Thanks for helping us understand the committee's work. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1207.66s)]
*  I appreciate you being here, Mel. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1209.46s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrAa7YseKnI&t=1211.5s)]
