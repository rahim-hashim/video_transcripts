# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Sept. 26
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo)
*  Joining us now is my friend David Corn. He is the Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=0.0s)]
*  He lately has been marinating in history to try to get us try to help us get our heads around our current moment [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=4.08s)]
*  His new excellent book is called American psychosis a historical investigation of how the Republican Party went crazy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=10.24s)]
*  David corn, thank you so much for writing this book and thank you for being here [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=17.8s)]
*  I'm sorry that I haven't been here enough to have you on right when it came out, but I'm really glad you could be here tonight [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=21.14s)]
*  Well, thanks a lot Rachel and um, I appreciate your respect for history [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=25.84s)]
*  We you know talking about what happened in Italy this you know [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=30.28s)]
*  This past few days over the hundred-year stretch you see the patterns you see what you call the rhymes of history [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=34.08s)]
*  And in doing this book American psychosis, I saw the same thing in American history [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=40.28s)]
*  We see patterns again and again that even we lived through that we don't recognize that, you know [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=45.64s)]
*  Republican Party and you know, we're now having a debate about whether MAGA extremism is something akin to fascism [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=50.86s)]
*  But the Republican Party for 70 years keeps having this dance with extremism, you know [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=57.46s)]
*  Encouraging exploiting extremism. It's happened all the time what we see now with Donald Trump and the Republican Party is not a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=64.18s)]
*  It's not a aberration. It's a continuation and I was struck because I was you know reading up on the Italian [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=71.10000000000001s)]
*  Election earlier today and there was an academic in Europe [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=78.42s)]
*  Who was talking about the history and he said what we're seeing in Italy is nothing new [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=82.78s)]
*  I mean you make that point quite quite obviously [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=87.7s)]
*  But even in the last 50 years the far-right has always been there [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  starting at the end of World War two and it has bubbled up and bubbled down bubbled up and bubbled down and now it's just [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=94.22s)]
*  Emerging but it's always been there the same way that I think we've always had a fringe far-right fanaticism [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  Here that the Republican Party has always tried to exploit to its own benefit [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=106.7s)]
*  whether it was McCarthyism the Burch's white segregationists in this in the 60s and 70s and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=111.34s)]
*  Donald Trump just made it burst out and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=117.34s)]
*  It's interesting in Italy, you know, they have a multiple party system [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=121.34s)]
*  So in Italy the the fringe elements the far-right the fascistic elements get their own parties in America [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=125.42s)]
*  It doesn't work that way. We don't have multiple parties [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=132.3s)]
*  But we have seen the expansion of the influence of these extremists within the Republican Party the Republican Party [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=134.78s)]
*  Acting like a coalition in Europe taking them in to get power and juice to the extent that we even see [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=143.58s)]
*  Donald Trump in recent days welcoming the QAnon movement into his [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=150.14s)]
*  Trumpist Republican Party the way that the majority or the close to majority coalition in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=155.62s)]
*  Italy has taken in and has been led by the fascists [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=162.42s)]
*  David I was struck by the fact that you document over and over again these moments where what we consider to be the mainstream [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=166.89999999999998s)]
*  Republican Party has to confront [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=174.42s)]
*  How much they want to be associated with people who they see and movements that they see as toxic [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  Anti-democratic extreme and in most cases embarrassing you talk about that with the John Birch Society [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=184.1s)]
*  For example and elements of the Goldwater campaign and the conservative media around that time you talk about it with Dwight Eisenhower [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=189.34s)]
*  General Eisenhower as president Eisenhower having to confront McCarthyism [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=196.7s)]
*  And the appeal of Joe McCarthy both at home in Wisconsin where he was an incredibly towering figure [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=201.78s)]
*  But also in terms of the way he tapped into some real dangerous energy on the far-right and I [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  Feel like you've busted a bunch of myths in terms of these sort of self-serving histories [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=214.66s)]
*  Where we've sort of told orders told ourselves left right and center that the the Republican Party the mainstream Republican Party has effectively [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=219.5s)]
*  Policed to those extremes and kept them at bay [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=226.74s)]
*  Until now and in fact I think tell me if I'm wrong [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=230.46s)]
*  But what I took from your book is that there are multiple instances in which the guys who we think of as the good guys or [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=234.68s)]
*  At least the mainstream people actually chose deliberately [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=239.94s)]
*  To keep cultivating those extremes to keep those you know the QAnon movements of their time [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=243.02s)]
*  alive and agitating for the Republican cause [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  You know again the pattern is obvious once you go back and look there is not not a single major [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=252.02s)]
*  Republican president or presidential candidate who did not embrace extremism to some degree [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=258.22s)]
*  It waxes and wanes that some do and some have done it more intensely than others [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=263.36s)]
*  But it's always in part of the Republican playbook a recent example that of course you're remembering most of our viewers [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=267.74s)]
*  Well would be John Boehner [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  Embracing the Tea Party the Tea Party was an extremist movement that you know was arguing that Barack Obama [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=276.38s)]
*  Was a secret socialist Muslim born in Africa had a secret plan to destroy the American economy [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=283.54s)]
*  So he could impose a totalitarian dictatorship [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=290.0s)]
*  I mean it's irrational the way McCarthyism was irrational and the way the QAnon is irrational and John Boehner country club Republican [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=292.74s)]
*  He knew that but he invited the Tea Party literally onto the steps of the Capitol for demonstrations brought him into the party [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  Because they helped him get elected speaker. They then chased him out, but he validated and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=307.26s)]
*  Authenticated the Tea Party perspective and like you know McCarthyism the Burch's or you go over to the fascist of Europe [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=313.18s)]
*  There's a there's a core there and the element that I see [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=320.82s)]
*  Uniting all this is that they look at the other side their political enemies and they [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=324.18s)]
*  Demonize and dehumanize them. There's their subversive. They want to destroy their society the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  McCarthyites believed there was a cabal that wanted to turn the US over to the Soviets and that was being run by people in the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=336.78s)]
*  US government I just described the Tea Party [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=343.7s)]
*  Conspiracy theory we know what the QAnon conspiracy theory is and if you listen to what Maloney is saying [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=346.70000000000005s)]
*  She's saying literally the other day. I saw her speech of hers. She says financial speculators [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=352.38000000000005s)]
*  I don't know what that's code for and woke activists want to steal our [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  identity our identities as Italians Christians and [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=363.62s)]
*  Women and men and turn us into [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=367.46000000000004s)]
*  consumer slaves [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=370.18s)]
*  I mean, that's very QAnon-ish in a way [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=371.66s)]
*  So it but it's all about challenging the other side not a matter of policy disputes or disagreeing on whether it's abortion or tax policy [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=374.66s)]
*  But calling them subversives who want to destroy the country we love take away our culture from us and the Republicans have played that game [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=382.3s)]
*  Again and again and again and I'm sorry, you know, we can't both sides this there is no equivalent on the Democratic side [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  This is an asymmetrical political [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=397.9s)]
*  History and it's really I mean the book, you know describes this and I think it portrays the dark side of the GOP [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=400.5s)]
*  for 70 years that the party itself has not acknowledged and that history and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=406.94s)]
*  Journalists have often not paid as enough attention to as they should but now we see it [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=413.09999999999997s)]
*  You know in full view because Donald Trump has made its center stage [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=417.53999999999996s)]
*  Even though both Germany and Italy were defeated in World War two, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  Both Germany and Italy surrendered and and and the fascist leaders of both of those countries died within 48 hours of each other [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=426.06s)]
*  coincidentally or not [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=433.3s)]
*  Germany subsequently famously went through an aggressive [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=436.14000000000004s)]
*  decades-long painful process of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=440.82s)]
*  denazification right plumbing the depths of why their country went that direction [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=444.34000000000003s)]
*  Committing to the concept and to the practical realities that they can never do anything like that again [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=449.22s)]
*  That happened in Germany, but no other country in Europe including Italy went through a process like that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=455.58000000000004s)]
*  And so we are at this very capital H [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=461.02000000000004s)]
*  historical moment right now where history keeps telling us that the last time such-and-such happened is during these very very very dark times from [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=464.14s)]
*  The last century and it is I know uncomfortable to talk about this part of history [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=471.06s)]
*  It is uncomfortable to talk about the Second World War and the fascism of that time [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=476.18s)]
*  But the reason we have to talk about it now is not to make a comparison [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=480.62s)]
*  This is not to make an allegory between then and today [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=483.86s)]
*  It's actually this history on its own terms Mussolini really was the fascist dictator of Italy [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=486.62s)]
*  And this is the party founded by his supporters and his staffers after his death [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=491.98s)]
*  That as of today is now going to rule Italy again [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=498.02000000000004s)]
*  and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=502.38s)]
*  This is obviously rattling everyone this side of Steve Bannon and CPAC. They apparently think it's delightful [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=503.7s)]
*  But everybody else is kind of you know back at the envelope tallying this up, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=509.90000000000003s)]
*  I mean you look at the leaders who are congratulating Georgia Maloney on her big win in Italy today. We've got Victor Orban in Hungary [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=513.46s)]
*  Great hero of the American right in Fox News now, right? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=521.74s)]
*  Victor Orban runs Hungary where the European Parliament says he has now effectively ended real democracy [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=525.4200000000001s)]
*  We've also got the law and Justice Party in Poland [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=532.1s)]
*  Which is following the same playbook to do the same thing that Orban has done in Hungary this time in Poland [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=534.9000000000001s)]
*  We've got Marine Le Pen the fascist leader in France who came very close to winning the French presidency [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=541.78s)]
*  Against Emmanuel Macron earlier this year [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=546.9s)]
*  We've got the new far-right party that won the second highest share of the vote in Sweden a few weeks ago the party [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=549.02s)]
*  Literally founded by neo-nazis and skinheads that may now be part of the Swedish government [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=554.62s)]
*  And of course, we've got the Kremlin with Putin running a fascist dictatorship. That is not only treating its own people in [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=559.9s)]
*  unspeakable ways [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=568.1s)]
*  But it's now bursting out of its borders invading its neighbors taking territory away from other countries [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=569.66s)]
*  Which is the first time that has happened in Europe since I'm sorry to say World War two [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=574.5s)]
*  In Russia tomorrow, they're gonna announce the so-called results of these [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=580.5s)]
*  Sham Potemkin little votes that they are holding in parts of Ukraine Ukraine has pushed Russia way back on the battlefield [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=585.74s)]
*  So in areas that Russian troops can still operate [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=593.78s)]
*  The Kremlin has now decided that they're going to declare democracy to be in effect and they're going to hold a vote a real good [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=596.7s)]
*  Real fair vote at the point of a gun where they've already proclaimed that the result of the vote will be that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=603.5400000000001s)]
*  Ukrainians want to be taken over by Russia these sham referendums. They're doing they're going to announce the results tomorrow [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=609.3000000000001s)]
*  They're patently ridiculous. There's no sense in which these are real or legitimate elections [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=615.82s)]
*  But they will use these fake elections these fake votes to do two things [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=620.34s)]
*  To justify [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=624.98s)]
*  Moving the border [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=627.3s)]
*  To justify taking these parts of this other country taking these parts of Ukraine and declaring that these are now part of Russia instead [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=629.3s)]
*  That's one of the things they're doing with this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=636.82s)]
*  Set of sham referenda these fake votes. They're taking in eastern Ukraine [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=640.0600000000001s)]
*  But the other reason they're doing it is to make a mockery of democracy [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=643.9s)]
*  Right to make it seem like elections are just fake. Oh, hey you in the West [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=647.98s)]
*  You say that voting is what makes things legitimate. Well, here's what we call a vote [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=653.1s)]
*  What are you going to criticize our democracy? We thought you love voting. This is just what the people want [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=656.62s)]
*  We're just following the desires of the people [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=661.54s)]
*  You sort of tally take a sort of you know back of the envelope tally in terms of how we're heading [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=666.98s)]
*  As a world in [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=673.78s)]
*  Terms of authoritarian and indeed fascist forms of government versus small-d democracy [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=675.78s)]
*  One side's winning right now [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=681.1800000000001s)]
*  In our country we are six weeks out [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=684.5400000000001s)]
*  As of tomorrow from our first big national election since the party of the ousted right-wing president [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=687.58s)]
*  Tried to maintain him in power by force by a mass assault on the US Capitol from his supporters [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=694.38s)]
*  It was just two years ago this past week in the run-up to that 2020 election when Trump started saying outright that he wouldn't [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=701.58s)]
*  Accept the results of that election unless he won [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=708.0600000000001s)]
*  That was a you know crazy benchmark for American politics at the time [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=710.0600000000001s)]
*  But it's now the new normal not just for him [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=714.0200000000001s)]
*  But for political candidates of his party hundreds of Republican candidates for office are standing for office [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=716.1400000000001s)]
*  Six weeks from now on the premise that the last election result from 2020 shouldn't have counted and maybe the next one shouldn't either [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=722.1s)]
*  Let's see how it turns out and I think we we think of this as a sort of [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=728.82s)]
*  Tactical radicalism on the part of Trump era Republicans a [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=734.54s)]
*  threat to the you know the technical nuts and bolts [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=739.06s)]
*  You know first Tuesday in July system by which we pick winners by voting [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=742.66s)]
*  But it's actually a much simpler problem than that which I think you can see more easily when you see it happening in other countries [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=748.14s)]
*  and it is [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=755.6999999999999s)]
*  And when you can see what changes in our country [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=757.6999999999999s)]
*  And when you can see what changes in other countries Republicans here are cheering for abroad [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=761.4200000000001s)]
*  And yes, I think it is easier to see when you can see when it has happened before [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=766.38s)]
*  What this is descended from in history? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=770.86s)]
*  Because no longer respecting election results isn't just about messing with elections themselves [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=774.7800000000001s)]
*  It's about a different kind of governance a different kind of power [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=780.82s)]
*  If they do not want your vote to determine who is in power [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=785.02s)]
*  That means they don't want to have to use power to try to meet your needs [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=789.98s)]
*  I'm just gonna say that one more time if they do not want it to be your vote that determines who is in power [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=794.98s)]
*  It means that they don't want to have to use power to try to meet your needs to try to earn your vote [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=803.62s)]
*  Yes, this is about messing with elections yes, this is about minority rule instead of majority rule [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=811.6600000000001s)]
*  But fundamentally basically at its very simplest level [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=816.36s)]
*  This is what this is this is the big thing that history tells us about right? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=820.2s)]
*  This is the thing that is easier to see in other countries than than in our own, but this is a very simple thing [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=824.6s)]
*  It is about separating power from the preferences of the people and instead just ruling over the people by force [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=829.84s)]
*  For their own purposes and to meet their own needs instead of the needs of the people if you are trying to get and hold [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=838.08s)]
*  Power by force and intimidation and not because the people want you there that doesn't well end well for anyone [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=844.12s)]
*  Not just in history not just as a political abstraction [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=850.36s)]
*  But in terms of how we live and what the prospects are for our families right? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=853.2s)]
*  What are the prospects for you and for your future and for your kids and for their future? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=859.08s)]
*  Whether or not you care about how it's gone in history [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=863.28s)]
*  Whether or not you care about how it's gone in history when the antecedents to these folks got in power [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=867.36s)]
*  Whether or not you care about majority rule or minority rule as concepts whether you care at all about the isms at the heart [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=872.12s)]
*  Of all these discussions this is about your life [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=878.88s)]
*  In a very practical everyday sense if there is a party that is trying to cast doubt on elections as the way we choose [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=882.0400000000001s)]
*  Who's in power it means they want to stay in power regardless of elections [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=888.48s)]
*  They want to stay in power without your consent and without your ability to remove them, which means they do not want to serve you [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=893.2s)]
*  And [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=900.54s)]
*  That means if you want government to do anything at all to make your family's life [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=901.74s)]
*  Materially better more stable more dignified [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=907.46s)]
*  This is a flashing red siren about the abandonment of that task [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=912.62s)]
*  and [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=917.0600000000001s)]
*  It is sometimes easier to see that in faraway countries than it is here and close up and it is sometimes easier to see it in [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=918.0600000000001s)]
*  history [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=923.8000000000001s)]
*  So we can recognize how it both leads to and rhymes with what we are going through today [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=924.74s)]
*  If you leave earth and head toward Mars about seven million miles away in that direction [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=931.3000000000001s)]
*  There's a little tiny asteroid called did a most [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=938.1400000000001s)]
*  This is a view of did a most from a telescope here on earth. This was footage that was taken in July [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=940.9000000000001s)]
*  It's real footage. It's sped up about 900 times [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=945.74s)]
*  Did a most is an asteroid it orbits the Sun just like we do takes about two years to go all the way around the Sun [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=949.4399999999999s)]
*  And even though did a most is little it also like us has a moon has its own little moonlit [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=955.2399999999999s)]
*  Which circles around did a most like a moth around a flame just like our moth our our moth our moon circles around us [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=961.68s)]
*  That little moonlit is so small. You can't even see it from here on earth, but we know it's there [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=968.8s)]
*  Because when it crosses between us and did a most the light that we can see from did a most dims for a second and then brightens [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=974.64s)]
*  So we know that there's something there that is passing around between us and did a most we know that little moonlit is circling around [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=983.48s)]
*  It takes a little less than 12 hours for that little moonlit to make it all the way around that asteroid [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=989.4s)]
*  Little less than 12 hours. That's how long it takes or at least that's how long it took [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=994.68s)]
*  Before tonight because we earthlings maybe just changed that [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=999.36s)]
*  About ten months ago NASA launched a rocket at that little moonlit [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1005.4399999999999s)]
*  Seriously, the hope was that the rocket would smash into the moonlit and knock it off course nudge it just enough to change its orbit [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1010.84s)]
*  Something like this had been tried before in the movies. It had never before been tried in real space before tonight a [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1018.0799999999999s)]
*  couple of hours ago [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1025.72s)]
*  The smash happened and we've got footage thanks to an onboard camera on the NASA [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1027.36s)]
*  Rocket, this is what the asteroid and its moon looked like as the NASA rocket approached and [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1033.32s)]
*  Then a few minutes later came the moment of impact watch [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1039.24s)]
*  Three two one [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1044.28s)]
*  All right, we got it [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1058.08s)]
*  The signal drops the image drops because the camera was on the rocket that successfully smashed into that little moonlit [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1076.52s)]
*  It worked now you may be wondering why did we do this? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1083.1599999999999s)]
*  What is the point of demolishing a perfectly good spacecraft and whacking into a perfectly good little moonlit asteroid thingy that never did anything to us? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1086.24s)]
*  Well, the point as you heard the [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1095.12s)]
*  NASA staffer say there is for humanity and in the name of planetary defense [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1097.1599999999999s)]
*  The point is the survival of life on earth [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1102.3999999999999s)]
*  This mission is a test to see [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1105.36s)]
*  Whether humanity can deflect an as yet undiscovered asteroid that God forbid might be heading right for our planet [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1107.7199999999998s)]
*  Whose impact could obliterate life on our planet the way? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1115.28s)]
*  That asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago when it smacked into us [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1119.08s)]
*  We're awaiting data from this mission to tell us whether the technique worked whether the moonlit was nudged and is [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1124.9599999999998s)]
*  Would land somewhere else if it were coming at us [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1132.32s)]
*  Sort of waiting for the proof of concept if you will [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1135.2s)]
*  But basically they were aiming to hit this little thing and they hit it [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1137.56s)]
*  And you know, who knows if one of the things human mind humankind is ever gonna be called upon to do is shoot a spaceship [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1141.8799999999999s)]
*  Into an asteroid to avert a collision that will wooly mammoth us all into mass extinction [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1147.1599999999999s)]
*  We don't know if we'll ever need this skill, but if we do need it [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1151.84s)]
*  Clearly we should work on developing it. We should get going on that this test tonight was to prove the concept that we can do it [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1156.24s)]
*  It turns out we can do it [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1163.44s)]
*  There is a lot of cynicism in the world in our country in particular a lot of ideological undercutting of the idea [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1166.68s)]
*  That governments can do anything, right? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1173.64s)]
*  I think we can all agree that saving earth from mass and instant death from above would be a good thing to be able to do [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1175.6000000000001s)]
*  So yay for the asteroid moonlit direct hit thing tonight, but proving that the government can do that proving we can do something [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1182.44s)]
*  important like that [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1189.8400000000001s)]
*  It's it's cursor more than its own reward [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1192.48s)]
*  So let it inspire us in ways large and small [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1196.44s)]
*  You [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De3GJ-KKOVo&t=1222.44s)]
