# 'Kremlin Christmas': Early days of Trump term delivers wish list for Russia, enemies of America
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0)
*  But I just want to say this again. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=0.0s)]
*  The nominee for FBI director, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=2.0s)]
*  taking $25,000 for a pro-Kremlin anti-FBI smear campaign, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  a film made by a guy who has made propaganda for the Kremlin [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=13.52s)]
*  that's kind of been his whole job in life, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=18.28s)]
*  it seems like the kind of story that should maybe break through. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=21.36s)]
*  And I know it's been kind of, you know, Kremlin Christmas this week, right? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=24.56s)]
*  I mean, the news from the New York Times this week [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=32.36s)]
*  that the new Trump administration and its infinite wisdom [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=34.56s)]
*  sent a huge list of personal identifying information of CIA personnel [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=37.0s)]
*  in an unclassified, unencrypted email. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=42.12s)]
*  The news that CIA personnel and people who work at the office of director of national intelligence [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=45.8s)]
*  are now among the government employees [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=49.72s)]
*  who have been invited to resign or else, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=51.92s)]
*  an effort that has been temporarily halted by a federal judge, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=55.52s)]
*  but it may be back in effect as soon as next week. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  Can you imagine how excited our foreign adversaries are [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  at the idea of a wholesale purge of all the experienced people [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=64.88s)]
*  in US intelligence and counterintelligence? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=68.4s)]
*  That said, I'm not sure how they narrowed down what to be happiest about. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=72.4s)]
*  Trump's new CIA chief, John Ratcliffe, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=75.36s)]
*  distinguished himself when he had his last big job, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=77.48s)]
*  and he was director of national intelligence in Trump's first term. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  In 2020, he released a batch of what he initially conceded [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=83.92s)]
*  might be Russian disinformation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=88.56s)]
*  that he apparently nevertheless hoped might help Trump in the 2020 election. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=90.72s)]
*  That's how he distinguished himself in 2020, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=95.8s)]
*  leading to calls for his resignation at the time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=98.68s)]
*  But now he's CIA director. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=100.84s)]
*  Trump's nominee for intelligence director this term [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=102.56s)]
*  has also been a phenomenal customer for notorious Russian disinformation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=105.08s)]
*  She, for example, put a megaphone on Russian false claims [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=109.28s)]
*  that the US had secret bio-weapons sites in Ukraine, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=112.36s)]
*  and that's the only reason we didn't want Mother Russia to invade. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=115.92s)]
*  Vladimir Putin ordered USAID out of his country more than a decade ago [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=121.68s)]
*  and has since spent years spreading lies and conspiracy theories about USAID [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=125.88s)]
*  to try to discredit it, to try to kill it, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=130.8s)]
*  including weird and totally made-up claims [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=133.64s)]
*  that aired on Russian state TV recently [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=136.68s)]
*  that said USAID funds had been spent to send American celebrities [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=139.24s)]
*  on international junkets. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=144.88s)]
*  These are totally false claims that came from Russian state TV [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=147.56s)]
*  that this past week were promoted online by Donald Trump Jr. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  and Trump campaign donor Elon Musk, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=156.28s)]
*  who did apparently this week dismantle USAID. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=159.52s)]
*  You may remember that Elon Musk himself was reportedly unable [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  to get a higher security clearance that he was seeking just this past year, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=168.72s)]
*  in part because of his ongoing and frequent communications [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=172.96s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin officials [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=175.8s)]
*  and his refusal to explain his international contacts and travel [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=178.2s)]
*  to the people who at least used to make decisions [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=181.44s)]
*  about security clearances in this country. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=183.64s)]
*  Among the government databases and computer systems [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=186.36s)]
*  that Musk and his team have now accessed, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=189.16s)]
*  that Office of Personnel Management System, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=192.44s)]
*  the first one they got into, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=197.24s)]
*  that's considered such a rich target for our foreign adversaries [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=198.72s)]
*  that it has repeatedly been targeted [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=202.8s)]
*  by foreign intelligence services trying to hack into it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, now Elon Musk and his band of interns is in there. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=209.88s)]
*  That should make it easier. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=213.36s)]
*  The Treasury payment system that Musk has taken over, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  among other things, that includes details of secret payments [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=218.24s)]
*  made to foreign assets who are being run abroad by US intelligence. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=222.52s)]
*  It includes details on payments made to US businesses abroad [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=226.84s)]
*  that have secret contracts with our intelligence services. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=231.68s)]
*  In other words, that payment system at the US Treasury, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=236.04000000000002s)]
*  among all the other things it contains, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=240.96s)]
*  it contains information that the Kremlin [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  and our other intelligence adversaries [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  would absolutely saw off their arm for. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=248.56s)]
*  But now Elon Musk is in there, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=253.12s)]
*  fresh off of not being able to get a security clearance [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=255.0s)]
*  because he wouldn't come clean about how much contact [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=257.44s)]
*  he has with the Kremlin and what he talks to them about. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=260.6s)]
*  It has been Kremlin Christmas for going on three weeks now, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=266.32s)]
*  thus far in the new Trump term. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=269.6s)]
*  But senators next week, Thursday next week, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=272.88s)]
*  will have the chance to decide [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=274.92s)]
*  if they want to put someone in charge of the FBI, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=276.44s)]
*  who literally took $25,000 to participate in a propaganda film [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=279.2s)]
*  attacking the FBI, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=283.52s)]
*  made by somebody who makes propaganda for the Kremlin. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=284.96s)]
*  This one, I don't know, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=292.12s)]
*  seems like kind of a different kind of red line. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=293.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=297.88s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O08NYeuqNz0&t=299.44s)]
