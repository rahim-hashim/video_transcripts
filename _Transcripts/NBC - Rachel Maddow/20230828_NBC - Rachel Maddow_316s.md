Video Description: A gunman on a homicidal rampage in Jacksonville, Florida appears to have been alone in committing his crime, but his apparently racist motivations make it wrong to consider him a "lone wolf" shooter. Kathleen Belew, who researches far-right extremism and white power movements, talks with Rachel Maddow about the context in which to understand violent far-right extremists.

# Why it's wrong to assume a single gunman is a 'lone wolf' shooter
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM)
*  Joining us now is one of the nation's leading researchers on far-right [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=0.0s)]
*  extremism and white power movements. Kathleen Ballou is an associate professor [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=3.58s)]
*  of history at Northwestern University. She's the author of the seminal work in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=7.04s)]
*  this field, Bring the War Home, the White Power Movement, and Paramilitary America. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=10.76s)]
*  Professor Ballou, I really appreciate you making time to be here with us again [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=15.42s)]
*  tonight. Thank you so much. Thanks for having me. So one of the reasons I wanted [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=18.48s)]
*  to talk to you tonight is because of the Jacksonville authorities, Jacksonville [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=22.98s)]
*  sheriff saying tonight that they're pretty sure they're going to release the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=26.72s)]
*  racist manifestos from the shooter in Jacksonville this weekend. They say that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=32.12s)]
*  they want to do that in the interest of transparency. Somebody who studied these [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=37.16s)]
*  things for a long time, what do you make of that decision? What do you think the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=41.32s)]
*  the impact is, positive or negative, of letting those manifestos see the light [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=44.2s)]
*  of day? So manifestos are tricky documents because on the one hand they [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=48.58s)]
*  are deeply coded. They are intended to impart information to future gunmen [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=53.48s)]
*  about target selection, weapon selection, the ins and outs of how to carry out a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=59.64s)]
*  similar attack. So we see these manifestos ending up in the hands of [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=64.12s)]
*  future attackers. That is a huge problem and authorities are absolutely right to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  be cautious in how they circulate. The trick is though that without the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=74.12s)]
*  manifesto, people who study white power violence, militant right violence, are [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=79.76s)]
*  really working with a much smaller amount of information. So right now were [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  I to say this is a clear incident of white power gun violence, I'm basing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=91.04s)]
*  that on the choice of the target and the scrawled messages on the barrel of the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=97.72s)]
*  gun. These are a clear reference to the Christchurch shooting. They're reminiscent [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  of what we saw in that attack. But without the manifesto, we're just [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=107.8s)]
*  working with a lot less information. I tend to think that we might easily [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=111.8s)]
*  release the manifestos to experts who can analyze them and decode without [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=116.36s)]
*  circulating them publicly and get sort of the best of both options. The [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=120.44s)]
*  Jacksonville sheriff has said publicly that he doesn't think the shooter was [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=125.8s)]
*  part of a larger group, that he acted alone, and as you mentioned obviously [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=130.24s)]
*  there's a lot that we still don't know here. But I wanted to ask you about this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=134.28s)]
*  sort of lone wolf idea because you've written a lot about this and I feel like [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=138.68s)]
*  your take on this is important for people to absorb at a popular level. If [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=142.24s)]
*  the shooter did espouse white supremacist beliefs, can you explain why [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=147.52s)]
*  it might be dangerous or even just wrong to dismiss that as a lone wolf event [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=151.08s)]
*  based on the fact that he acted as a single person when he went out shooting? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=156.24s)]
*  Absolutely, and this is why we need the manifesto. Because when we consume [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  stories about white power violence as single events, as a lone wolf attack, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=165.72s)]
*  quote-unquote, we are consuming them as if they are existing without connection [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  to each other, without an ideological basis. So this is how we get stories [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=175.32s)]
*  about Jacksonville as something separate from Christchurch and Pittsburgh and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=179.92s)]
*  Buffalo and Charleston. Many of these attacks have not only shared [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=185.52s)]
*  characteristics in the communities that are impacted, but they are all carried [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=190.8s)]
*  out by white power perpetrators who are united through social ties, they're [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=194.96s)]
*  united ideologically, they share information about weapons and tactics [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=199.06s)]
*  and strategies, and they are all working for the same purpose, which by the way is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=203.28s)]
*  not limited only to mass attacks as a strategy, but also exists in precisely [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=207.8s)]
*  this landscape you have just outlined where it is running into our national [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  politics. It should be discussed in the same breath, not only as other mass [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=218.24s)]
*  attacks, but also in the same breath as the other sort of pings of activity that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=222.88s)]
*  you have outlined. One way to think about this is that although the scheduling of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=228.68s)]
*  the acts handle Saturday moment for the Trump campaign might have been erroneous, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=233.96s)]
*  we have many other incidents where Trump's open embrace of this movement [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=238.72s)]
*  has not been erroneous. And I could think, for instance, of the press conference he [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=243.88s)]
*  scheduled in Waco this spring to announce his renewed campaign for 2024. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=248.16s)]
*  Waco, to many people, may simply signify the Branch Davidian siege and the sort [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=256.44s)]
*  of general anti-federal government sentiment that people take from that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=264.76s)]
*  But to white power activists, Waco is a direct reference to the Oklahoma City [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=269.16s)]
*  bombing. It is a call to further violence. So, you know, we can have a discussion [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=274.4s)]
*  about whether or not they meant it this way, but there is plenty of information, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=280.12s)]
*  plenty of historical precedent, plenty of expert analysis that can tell us what [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=285.04s)]
*  this movement will perceive. And all signs point to increasing acts of violence. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEooV5TIsM&t=289.84s)]
