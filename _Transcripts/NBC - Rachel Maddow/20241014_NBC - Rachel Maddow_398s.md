# Mark Cuban: 'No good reason to vote for Donald Trump as the business candidate'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk)
*  You may know the billionaire businessman and investor Mark Cuban from the long-running sort of iconic TV show Shark Tank [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=0.0s)]
*  Where he invests in people's business ideas. You may know him as an owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team a franchise [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=7.04s)]
*  He's widely credited with turning around [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=12.76s)]
*  Mark Cuban is a self-made billionaire [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=15.22s)]
*  He's a larger-than-life American character who kind of epitomizes what we like to think of when we think of achieving the American dream [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=17.72s)]
*  through business acumen and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  And so in 2015 when fellow very famous businessman Donald Trump rode down his escalator and into a presidential bid [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=27.2s)]
*  Mr. Cuban initially said he was very excited [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=34.44s)]
*  He said having a non-politician a businessman in the race was boat [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=37.2s)]
*  Probably the best thing to happen to politics in a long long time [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=40.56s)]
*  He said he had 10 to 15 conversations with Trump as a candidate during which he tried to give Trump advice or or talk about [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=43.8s)]
*  Policy he even said at one point he'd consider being Trump's vice president [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=50.28s)]
*  Thank goodness he didn't given how that worked out for the guy who did get the job [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=54.56s)]
*  But then mr. Cuban fairly quickly realized that Trump was was very much not the best thing to happen to politics [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=59.08s)]
*  And it's been a very long time since he said anything nice about Trump and his political prospects [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=64.8s)]
*  But mark Cuban is a business guy full stop and he is no fan of politicians in general [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=70.12s)]
*  And that is why it is a big deal now that mark Cuban has so loudly and enthusiastically endorsed Kamala Harris for president [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=75.8s)]
*  He says it's not just because he thinks Donald Trump would be a disaster in a second term [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=83.76s)]
*  But because he thinks that Harris would be a really good president in particular. She would be a really good president for the American economy [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=87.6s)]
*  Joining us now for the interview is investor entrepreneur mark Cuban. He's also the co-founder of the public benefit corporation [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=95.4s)]
*  Cost plus drugs. Mr. Cuban. It's really nice to meet you. Thank you so much for being here [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=101.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me on Rachel. Call me mark. I don't like to miss your stuff. I got you. Well, you can call me Rachel [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=106.84s)]
*  Let me ask about [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=113.0s)]
*  My overall sort of premise here. I am NOT a business person. I don't have a brain for business [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=115.0s)]
*  Stuff and I'll be the first to admit it [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=121.28s)]
*  That's it [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=124.24s)]
*  I have a lot of conversations with people who say they're making business based decisions about [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Politics and I feel like that's been driving me more crazy this year than it does in [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=128.84s)]
*  If I said anything that you think I got really the wrong way around [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=134.28s)]
*  No, listen to you got it you nailed it [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=137.8s)]
*  I mean you took it line item by line item and and laid it all out [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, there's really no good reason to vote for Donald Trump as the business candidate [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  You know in doing business whether you're a small company or a very large company you want stability [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  You don't want to wake up one morning as the CEO of John Deere and find out all of a sudden [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  You've got a 200 percent tariff. You don't want to be carrier error and find out that you know [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=159.44s)]
*  He's threatening you if you move employees [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=164.56s)]
*  Those are the types of decisions that take years to plan in and put together [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  And so stability is the number one rule for a big business and for a smaller business. You just want the opportunity [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=170.56s)]
*  In terms of the targeting that he is talking about for a second term [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  And what we saw in his first term when he picked out individual businesses or sometimes individual business leaders [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  Who he wanted to use the government to punish? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=190.88s)]
*  When he went after Amazon and Jeff Bezos when he went after saying he wanted to go after Mark Zuckerberg when he did other things [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=193.68s)]
*  That were targeting businesses because of what were perceived to be his political interests [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=200.28s)]
*  I would have thought that that would have made him radioactive in the business world because business people are too smart [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=204.76s)]
*  To think that they can always be on the right side of those calculations, right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  That they won't ever be the one who's in the crosshairs [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=213.6s)]
*  Once you've got somebody who uses the government that way to reward and punish his enemies and his friends [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=216.28s)]
*  Well, you don't hear a whole lot of CEOs other than Elon Musk particularly of large companies [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=223.28s)]
*  Coming out and supporting him for that very reason, you know [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=227.12s)]
*  You don't hear them condemning him because they're worried about his rep retribution or his vengeance [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=230.16s)]
*  But literally there's been [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=236.2s)]
*  Nobody that I know other than Leon Elon that has come out and support of him [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=239.16s)]
*  You recently said in an interview that some business leaders who are supporting Trump [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=244.72s)]
*  With the caveat of what you just described in terms of you know, high-level leaders not too many of them doing it [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=250.44s)]
*  You said that some business leaders who are supporting Trump are doing it because they think they can manipulate him [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=256.52s)]
*  Can you explain what you what you mean by that? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=261.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's very transactional for the right amount, you know, you can guide policy. I think you saw that with crypto [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=264.36s)]
*  You know, there's different types of crypto and let me just say I'm a huge fan of crypto and its utility [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  I support Bitcoin Ethereum, etc [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=276.12s)]
*  But there's a lot of large-scale Bitcoin owners like the Winklevoss twins, etc [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=278.32s)]
*  Who have made significant donations in an effort to manipulate his perception of crypto to their benefit [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=283.2s)]
*  And so I think that's the perfect example of him being transactional and can be manipulated [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  What do you make of his crypto venture? I mean, I saw headlines about it when he first announced it [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=296.4s)]
*  I saw the rollout was ridiculous. But the more I looked into it [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, here's one of my favorite details of the whole thing. This is reported in the New York Times [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=305.16s)]
*  He met these guys including the ex con and the the pickup artist guy through a real estate billionaire guy who he knows and that guy's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=308.6s)]
*  crypto [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=318.12s)]
*  Savvy was such that he called a mean coin a Mimi coin and that's the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  Set up his company come on [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  It's all crazy [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=331.0s)]
*  I mean the only reason you sell cologne you sell commemorative coins [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=331.92s)]
*  You sell sneakers and you put together this d5 project is because you need the money [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=336.32s)]
*  You know you have to and that's the insanity of it all people trying to look at him as a good business person [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  When he literally can't run his own businesses, you don't hear stories about his overwhelming success [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=348.0s)]
*  in any [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=355.52s)]
*  businesses [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=356.88s)]
*  You know [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=360.8s)]
*  Side of real estate and and even those were questions. I don't see how people really support him as a business person [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=362.28s)]
*  Investor and entrepreneur mark Cuban. I really appreciate you you doing this tonight. I know your time is really valuable. Thanks for being here. Thank you [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=369.32s)]
*  Thanks for having me on rage [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=376.28s)]
*  You [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-ZL1bWgylk&t=390.2s)]
