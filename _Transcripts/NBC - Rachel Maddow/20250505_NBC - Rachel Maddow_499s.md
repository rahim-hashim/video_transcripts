# Trump's shiny object trick wears thin quickly in second term
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8)
*  Here's something new. Today we learned that hackers claim to have hacked into the computer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=0.0s)]
*  systems of the airline that operates many of Donald Trump's deportation flights. The [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=5.78s)]
*  company is called Global X, and their flights for the Trump administration include those [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=13.14s)]
*  three plane loads of men who were flown from the U.S. to El Salvador last month. Those [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=17.7s)]
*  – excuse me – in March, those three flights, famously, were the ones that a federal judge [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=23.44s)]
*  ordered must be turned around and flown back to the United States. That's an order the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=28.22s)]
*  Trump administration did not obey. Well, today, 404 Media reports that they are in contact [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=32.5s)]
*  with a hacking group that claims to have hacked into Global X and taken, among other things, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=37.98s)]
*  their flight records and passenger manifests for all the deportation flights that Global [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=44.14s)]
*  X has operated for the Trump administration. 404 Media says, as far as they can tell, the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  data appears to be genuine. But that's not the only major hack that 404 Media has brought [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=54.82s)]
*  to light just in the last day or so. You remember Mike Walz, Trump national security advisor, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  who accidentally added the editor of the Atlantic magazine to a Signal group chat about war [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=66.14s)]
*  plans in Yemen. You may have seen reports last week that at the cabinet meeting at the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=70.74s)]
*  White House on Wednesday, Mr. Walz was caught on camera by a Reuters photographer using [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=76.1s)]
*  his personal phone, or using his phone at least, at that cabinet meeting and appearing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=82.3s)]
*  like he was still using something that looked very much like Signal to chat with multiple [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  high-ranking government officials. The news photographer was actually able to capture [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=93.14s)]
*  the text of some of his messages on what appeared to be the Signal app that he was using during [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  the cabinet meeting in front of a bunch of news reporters. Now, I say it looked like [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=104.1s)]
*  the Signal app. It wasn't the original Signal app. It was a different version of Signal [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=109.34s)]
*  called TeleMessage made by a different company that appears to be considerably less secure [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=114.30000000000001s)]
*  than Signal. Sure enough, 404 Media now reports that that app, TeleMessage, has also just [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=119.9s)]
*  been hacked. NBC News, meanwhile, was contacted by a different, entirely separate hacker who [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=129.26s)]
*  also claims to have hacked this TeleMessage app. TeleMessage has now suspended its operations, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=135.26s)]
*  which is going to be so inconvenient for the whole Trump administration national security [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=142.42s)]
*  apparatus that was apparently using it amongst themselves, so that's all going well. Of course, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=145.94s)]
*  Mike Walz is no longer Trump's national security advisor. He was fired and replaced by Secretary [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=152.94s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio, who is also simultaneously the archivist of the United States now and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=158.3s)]
*  the acting administrator of USAID and now national security advisor as well, which tells you just [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=163.74s)]
*  how seriously Donald Trump takes all those jobs, right? If he thought any one of those [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=170.82000000000002s)]
*  jobs was a real job, he wouldn't give the person holding that job lots of other jobs, too. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=175.3s)]
*  In fact, not only does Donald Trump not appear to think that the job of national security [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=180.3s)]
*  advisor is all that big a deal, The Washington Post now reports that some senior White House [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=186.5s)]
*  officials are, quote, questioning the need for a traditional national security counsel [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  at all. So national security advisor behaving the way we know Mike Walz has, national security [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=195.26s)]
*  advisor being fired, national security counsel all going away, the whole White House national [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=202.54s)]
*  security counsel, that whole apparatus? Really? You guys don't see the need for it? At which [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=209.26s)]
*  point you might want somebody who worked in the White House to explain the consequences [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=216.46s)]
*  of something like that. Luckily, your new 9 p.m. Eastern host here on MSNBC Tuesday [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  through Friday, starting tomorrow, has definitely worked in the White House and she understands [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=226.42s)]
*  these things and many others. Joining us now, I'm very pleased to say, is my colleague, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=231.61999999999998s)]
*  Jen Psaki, former White House press secretary and starting tomorrow, the host of this 9 [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=236.98s)]
*  p.m. hour here on MSNBC, the host of The Briefing with Jen Psaki here 9 p.m. Eastern Tuesday [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=241.89999999999998s)]
*  to Friday. Jen, it is great to see you. Congratulations on the new gig. How are you feeling? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=248.74s)]
*  It's great to be here. I am feeling all of the feelings at once. I'm excited. I read [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=253.18s)]
*  to the depths of the Internet, which is not productive. I've listened to every podcast [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  of every person who's going to appear on the show and I'm just excited. And I'm so [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=263.22s)]
*  delighted to be here with you tonight. You're such an inspiration to me and everybody watching, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=268.06s)]
*  I know. And I can promise everybody, I know we'll talk about serious things, that you [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=273.02s)]
*  have shined such a light in the first hundred days, Rachel, on such an important part of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=277.22s)]
*  what's happening right now. We are going to continue to do that. I care about the story [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=281.42s)]
*  like you care about the story. And thank you for doing that, because it's been a little [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=285.18s)]
*  dose of hope and inspiration for me watching, too, as I know it has been for everyone out [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  there. Well, it's part of what I wanted to talk to you about tonight, because I feel [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=293.14000000000004s)]
*  like one of the things that we have had to sort of calibrate and rebalance over the first [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=296.82000000000005s)]
*  hundred days is like, where does news happen? And I mean, forgive me for saying this about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=302.34s)]
*  one of your successors, but the news is not really happening in the White House briefing [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=308.46s)]
*  room. Like that's not a place where people are getting like, you can take it to the bank. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=312.58s)]
*  It's not the room where it happens. No, it's not take it to the bank information. And we're [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  not getting news and information from the White House, other than sort of proclamations [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=319.5s)]
*  and provocations and occasional scandals. A lot of what we're learning about in terms [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  of the most important stuff for the government is happening not just not in Washington, but [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=328.58s)]
*  not on the coasts and not on the interstate. It's the it's where the destruction of the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=334.02s)]
*  government meets the American people. It's the messed up Social Security field office. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=339.18s)]
*  It is the VA office where people can't get their medical appointments done without with [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=344.2s)]
*  any sort of privacy. It's the Social Security checks running late. It's the Head Start offices [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=349.26s)]
*  closing. It's Meals on Wheels being shut down. And I wanted to know how you're feeling [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=354.38s)]
*  about that with so much White House experience and Washington experience about how we should [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=359.38s)]
*  be thinking about the aperture of where news comes from and where trusted sources of information [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=363.38s)]
*  come from in an environment that's this toxic in your former workplace. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=368.06s)]
*  Well, I've learned a couple things from you and a number of other people who've done this [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=372.94s)]
*  for a long time. And one is you can't cover every single story every night. And so I'm [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=376.9s)]
*  not going to attempt to do that. But I think we've also learned a lot about what Donald [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=381.1s)]
*  Trump tries to do. He tries to flood the zone, but he also tries to wave the shiny ball. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=385.46000000000004s)]
*  I don't even know if that's the right analogy, but just take in the last 24 hours. I mean, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=391.02000000000004s)]
*  he announced he wants to reopen Alcatraz. The prompting and what motivated that. Here we [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=396.26000000000005s)]
*  are at the same time to your point, it's just to keep with your theme of Social Security. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=401.66s)]
*  What we need to be reading the fine print on, I know you are and I will be, is what [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=406.54s)]
*  he is doing to the Social Security system and administration. It's cutting offices. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=411.1s)]
*  He's also trying to gain access to people's private information and personal data. And [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=415.74s)]
*  so I think it's incumbent upon us to not follow the shiny ball. You always say don't let [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=420.70000000000005s)]
*  him jerk your chain, I think is what you say, but not follow the things he's trying to get [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  us to pay attention to and to dig deeper into the things that he maybe doesn't want us to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=432.02000000000004s)]
*  talk about and Social Security and what he's doing to that is one of them. But every day [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=435.82s)]
*  you have to make choices and decisions. As you well know, I know you've been making them [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=440.18s)]
*  hard ones many days. Yeah. Jen Psaki, the new show is called The Briefing with Jen Psaki. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=443.78s)]
*  It premieres tomorrow night at 9 p.m. Eastern. Attendance is mandatory for everybody watching [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=450.3s)]
*  right now. Jen, as I understand it, your first guest is going to be former Transportation [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  Secretary and varsity Democratic Party communicator, former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=458.78s)]
*  I'm definitely not going to miss that. So excited for you, my friend. Congratulations. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=465.42s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here tonight and good luck tomorrow. Thank you so much. Thank [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=470.74s)]
*  you. Appreciate it. Great to have you. Great being with you. We'll be right back. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNHos-Xn0V8&t=474.18s)]
