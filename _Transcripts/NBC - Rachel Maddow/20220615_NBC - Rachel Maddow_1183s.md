# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: June 14
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU)
*  There's a combination of Italians, Germans, I mean, different things have been floating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=0.0s)]
*  around as to who was involved. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=5.76s)]
*  Yugo Chavez in Venezuela, she has an affidavit from somebody who says they wrote a software [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=8.16s)]
*  in something with the Philippines and just all over the radar. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  I thought the Dominion stuff was, I never saw any evidence whatsoever to sustain those [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=17.2s)]
*  allegations. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=23.52s)]
*  What they were proposing, I thought was nuts. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=24.52s)]
*  You know, the theory was also completely nuts. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=28.48s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  That's Trump White House lawyer Eric Hirschman, part of his deposition testimony to the January [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=33.44s)]
*  6th investigation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  You can tell he's a Trump lawyer because he's got a baseball bat on the wall behind him [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=39.2s)]
*  that says, justice on it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=43.84s)]
*  That's exactly the kind of hot sauce Trump likes in a lawyer, right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=45.72s)]
*  But in this case, he's not defending Trump anymore. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=49.72s)]
*  He's not saying, impeach Trump. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=51.64s)]
*  No, go back in time and impeach Obama. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=53.32s)]
*  This time, this time, he's taking apart what he depicts to the January 6th investigators [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=56.52s)]
*  as just the stupidity in his characterization of some of the far-fetched claims of supposed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  fraud that the president wanted to use as the excuse for overthrowing the U.S. government. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=68.76s)]
*  That testimony that we just saw there, that I just played here moments ago, we saw that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=76.0s)]
*  testimony from him before today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=79.28s)]
*  But then this evening, the January 6th investigators released a new taped statement from [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=81.72s)]
*  Republican Vice Chair Liz Cheney, and she included at the end of her statement something [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  else from Trump lawyer Eric Hirschman to get us ready for what's coming next from the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  investigation's next hearing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=97.16s)]
*  In our next hearing on Thursday, the Select Committee will examine President Trump's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=100.8s)]
*  relentless effort on January 6th and in the days beforehand to pressure Vice President [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=104.83999999999999s)]
*  Pence to refuse to count lawful electoral votes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=110.6s)]
*  As a federal judge has indicated, this likely violated two federal criminal statutes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=114.76s)]
*  President Trump had no factual basis for what he was doing, and he had been told it was [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  illegal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  Despite this, President Trump plotted with a lawyer named John Eastman and others to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=127.12s)]
*  overturn the outcome of the election on January 6th. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=132.76s)]
*  To give you a sense of the gravity of these issues, here is a clip of one of President [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump's own White House lawyers, Eric Hirschman, who talks to Mr. Eastman the day after January [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=141.52s)]
*  6th. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=148.12s)]
*  It was the day after. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=149.12s)]
*  Eastman, I don't remember why he called me, or he texted me or called me, wanted to talk [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=152.56s)]
*  with me, and he said he couldn't reach others. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=160.96s)]
*  And he started to ask me about something dealing with Georgia and preserving something potentially [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=166.32s)]
*  for appeal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=172.28s)]
*  And I said to him, are you out of your f-ing mind? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=176.32s)]
*  I said, I only want to hear two words coming out of your mouth from now on. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=183.32s)]
*  Orally transition. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=191.16s)]
*  And he said, I don't want to hear any other f-ing words coming out of your mouth no matter [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=193.16s)]
*  what, other than orderly transition. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  Repeat those words to me. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=199.92s)]
*  And I eventually said, orderly transition. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=202.44s)]
*  I said, good, John, now I'm going to give you the best free legal advice you're ever [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=205.44s)]
*  getting in your life. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  Get a great f-ing criminal defense lawyer. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=212.62s)]
*  You're going to need it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=214.92s)]
*  And then I hung up on him. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=215.92s)]
*  This is the best free legal advice you're ever getting in your life. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=220.92s)]
*  Note to self, you like to hire bombastic lawyers who talk like this when they defend you? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=223.92s)]
*  Well, they're also going to talk like that when they decide they're not going to defend [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=229.92s)]
*  you anymore because now they've come to believe you're part of a criminal enterprise and they're [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=232.92s)]
*  willing to testify about that under oath. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=236.92s)]
*  And I said, I don't want to hear any other f-ing words coming out of your mouth from [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=239.92s)]
*  now on. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=244.92s)]
*  And I said, good, John, now I'm going to give you the best free legal advice you're ever [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=245.92s)]
*  getting in your life. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=248.92s)]
*  The substance of what Mr. Hirschman is sort of blustering at here, though, with a bat [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=249.92s)]
*  over his shoulder to, you know, send home the point. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  The substance of what he's blustering at is a real thing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=260.8s)]
*  I mean, John Eastman was another of this illustrious pantheon of Trump lawyers. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=263.32s)]
*  He really knows how to pick them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=269.12s)]
*  And Eastman has been litigating in federal court against subpoenas that he's received [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=271.15999999999997s)]
*  from the January 6 investigation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=275.88s)]
*  And he has said in his litigation that he was acting as an attorney to President Trump. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=278.04s)]
*  And there's such a thing as attorney-client privilege. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=285.24s)]
*  It says prosecutors basically aren't allowed to see communications that happen between [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=286.24s)]
*  a person and their lawyer. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=290.06s)]
*  A person is entitled to confidential legal advice that you can keep secret from the government, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=291.44s)]
*  even in the face of a subpoena. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=296.68s)]
*  That said, the attorney-client privilege is not limitless. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=298.92s)]
*  And in the case of Trump and this lawyer, John Eastman, in the litigation where Eastman's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=303.88s)]
*  trying to keep his communications and his documents secret, keep them away from investigators, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=308.64s)]
*  a federal judge has now ruled twice in recent weeks that Eastman actually has to hand over [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=314.2s)]
*  these communications and documents to the investigation, even though he was acting as [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=319.92s)]
*  Trump's lawyer. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=324.12s)]
*  Because even though there is such a thing as attorney-client privilege, you can't use [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=325.12s)]
*  it to cover up a crime. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=329.4s)]
*  You can't use it to keep secret the evidence that a lawyer and a client were actually planning [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=331.52s)]
*  crimes together. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=338.28s)]
*  And a judge has ruled already that Trump and Eastman were making forth with the criming. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=341.4s)]
*  And therefore, Eastman has to hand over his documents and communications because crime, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=351.52s)]
*  Because there is a crime fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=357.16s)]
*  The judge believes that that is likely implicated in this case, that they were plotting a crime [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=361.72s)]
*  together, and therefore his documents and communications have to be handed over to the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=366.92s)]
*  investigation. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=371.88000000000005s)]
*  And that is a very substantive thing for a federal judge to conclude. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  And that is why Eric Hirschman, in classic Trump lawyer language, told the other Trump [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  lawyer, John Eastman, that he was going to give him the best free legal advice you're [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=382.12s)]
*  ever getting in your life. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  Get a great F in criminal defense lawyer. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  You're going to need it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=389.12s)]
*  And then I hung up. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=390.12s)]
*  That's why you're getting that between Trump lawyers. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=391.56s)]
*  And that also is what Liz Cheney was getting at in this little part of her intro there, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=395.46s)]
*  in this specific part of it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=400.24s)]
*  President Trump's relentless effort on January 6th and in the days beforehand to pressure [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=404.2s)]
*  Vice President Pence to refuse to count lawful electoral votes. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=409.64s)]
*  As a federal judge has indicated, this likely violated two federal criminal statutes. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=414.64s)]
*  Trump's effort on January 6th and the days beforehand to pressure Vice President Pence [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=421.12s)]
*  that he should refuse to count the electoral votes likely violated two federal criminal [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  statutes. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=431.96s)]
*  That is Liz Cheney saying that per a federal judge's ruling, President Trump and his lawyer, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=432.96s)]
*  John Eastman, likely violated two federal laws when they pressured Mike Pence the way [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=438.24s)]
*  that they did. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  And what I'm specifically describing, you can check it in the judge's ruling, are these [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=445.56s)]
*  two federal statutes, 18 U.S. Code section 1512 C and 18 U.S. Code section 371. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=447.8s)]
*  In plain English, that's obstruction of an official proceeding and it's conspiracy to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=456.92s)]
*  defraud the United States. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  And you know, there's been all this talk in the last, I don't mean, I don't, I hate people [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=465.48s)]
*  in the media doing media criticism, but I'm just going to say this because I feel like [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  this is an issue that kind of needs a little bit of offense put around it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=474.56s)]
*  It's kind of becoming, getting blown up into a bigger deal than it actually is. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=477.12s)]
*  There's been all this talk over the past few months, but particularly in the past couple [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=481.52000000000004s)]
*  of days about whether or not the January 6th investigation at the end of their investigation, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=484.76s)]
*  whether they're going to make formal referrals to the U.S. Department of Justice about prosecuting [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=488.88s)]
*  crimes that the investigation has turned up. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=495.48s)]
*  There's all this focus on whether or not all the members of the committee feel the same [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=500.16s)]
*  way about that issue, what they've said about whether they're going to issue criminal referrals [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=503.66s)]
*  or whether they're not going to issue criminal referrals. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=507.18s)]
*  Honestly, it's kind of moot. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=509.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, here tonight in this video released on Twitter, Congresswoman Liz Cheney is making [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=512.54s)]
*  criminal referrals. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=517.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=518.58s)]
*  I mean, laying out the evidence, the committee, the investigation has been laying out the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=519.58s)]
*  evidence that they have found of potential crimes. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=523.66s)]
*  They have named the federal statutes they believe were violated and they have named [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=525.98s)]
*  the people who they say did it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=531.06s)]
*  I mean, that's a criminal referral. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=534.38s)]
*  Whether or not you write it down or you say it in a video that's posted online from the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=536.5799999999999s)]
*  official Twitter account of the January 6th investigation, that's it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=539.9s)]
*  I mean, what else do you want? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=543.5s)]
*  This is the January 6th investigators serving the volleyball over the net to federal prosecutors. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=544.8599999999999s)]
*  Ah, another cooperator. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=552.8599999999999s)]
*  Today, another member of the pro-Trump right-wing paramilitary group, the Proud Boys, pled guilty [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=555.5400000000001s)]
*  for his role in the January 6th attack and also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=561.74s)]
*  This makes three now, three members of the so-called Proud Boys who've pled guilty. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=566.0s)]
*  One of those who's cooperating is cooperating in the seditious conspiracy case the Justice [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=571.26s)]
*  Department has brought against the group. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=575.22s)]
*  There's also a seditious conspiracy case pending against the members of another proto-fascist, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=577.22s)]
*  pro-Trump paramilitary group called the Oath Keepers. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=583.3s)]
*  Seditious conspiracy is a specific, rarely charged, very serious crime that the Justice [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=586.8199999999999s)]
*  Department has had a heck of a time in previous cases proving it, the very few times it's [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=592.5799999999999s)]
*  ever been used in the US criminal law. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=598.74s)]
*  But one of the things we are learning from the indictments and from the court filings [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=601.42s)]
*  in those sedition cases and in the public hearings by the January 6th investigation [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=606.66s)]
*  is that these paramilitary groups were apparently an important integral part of the plot to [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=611.3399999999999s)]
*  try to overthrow the government, to stop the certification of the last election by using [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=615.9799999999999s)]
*  force inside the US Capitol. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  The January 6th investigators have laid out how hundreds of these Proud Boys marched to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=624.0s)]
*  the Capitol hours before Trump directed the crowd at his rally that they should go to [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=629.38s)]
*  the Capitol. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=634.3s)]
*  They started attacking police just as Trump started sending the big mob their way. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=635.3s)]
*  They were effectively the tip of the spear. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=640.0999999999999s)]
*  They breached the Capitol and then the mob was there to roll in behind them. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=642.6999999999999s)]
*  The chairman of the January 6th investigation says at upcoming hearings, witnesses will [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=647.14s)]
*  describe conversations between these paramilitary groups that led the breach of the Capitol [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=651.04s)]
*  and people in the orbit of then President Trump. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=656.78s)]
*  They're charged with sedition and then there's him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=660.02s)]
*  But you know, these aren't the only fascist right-wing paramilitary groups that are operating [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=665.4200000000001s)]
*  on the bleeding edge of right-wing politics right now. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=671.4200000000001s)]
*  Just this past weekend, for example, there was this. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=674.86s)]
*  These guys stopped at U-Haul full of dudes. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=678.98s)]
*  A swarm of extremists who Idaho police say came to riot. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=682.34s)]
*  31 suspected white nationalists zip-tied and arrested blocks from a Pride festival. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=686.0600000000001s)]
*  There was at least one smoke grenade. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=691.62s)]
*  There was multiple shields. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=694.34s)]
*  Coeur d'Alene police Saturday discovered the crowd crammed in a U-Haul after a 911 caller [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=696.14s)]
*  described seeing a little army at a local hotel with masks on their faces and slogans [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=700.74s)]
*  like reclaim America on their shirts. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=705.86s)]
*  Police charging all 31 with conspiracy to riot, noting they planned to swarm several [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=708.7s)]
*  parts of Coeur d'Alene and carried paperwork similar to an operations plan that a police [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=713.3000000000001s)]
*  or military group would put together. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=718.3000000000001s)]
*  They traveled in from states all across the country, allegedly united by white nationalism. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=720.72s)]
*  They appear to be affiliated with the group Patriot Front. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=725.9200000000001s)]
*  They call themselves Patriot Front. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=730.6800000000001s)]
*  They have ridiculous little uniforms. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=733.0400000000001s)]
*  You might recognize them by their distinctive matching khakis, which is supposed to be [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=734.52s)]
*  menacing instead of making it look like they all just got off work together at Best Buy. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  But this was them in D.C. last year trying to intimidate with their little homemade shields [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=745.0s)]
*  and their JV soccer shin guards. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=749.0s)]
*  This group is a renamed version of one of the white nationalist groups that took part [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=752.2800000000001s)]
*  in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=756.0s)]
*  The group renamed itself after one of its members killed Heather Heyer, a counter-protester, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=759.4000000000001s)]
*  and seriously injured a ton of other people when he deliberately drove his speeding car [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  into a crowd of anti-racist protesters. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=770.0400000000001s)]
*  But them targeting the Pride event in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho this weekend, one of the most [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=775.04s)]
*  unnerving things about the reporting on this was that Patriot Front was apparently not [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=780.24s)]
*  even the only armed far-right group that was targeting that particular Pride event in that [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=784.48s)]
*  particular part of Idaho this weekend. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=790.24s)]
*  Another so-called Patriot group had planned a show-off-your-gun event to coincide with [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=792.84s)]
*  and menace that same Pride gathering in Coeur d'Alene. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=798.96s)]
*  The same weekend, a different group of Proud Boys stormed into a library in the San Francisco [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=803.0799999999999s)]
*  Bay area and disrupted a children's story session, shouting anti-gay and anti-trans threats [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=807.52s)]
*  because the story time was led by a drag queen and so they were there to break it up by force. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=813.9599999999999s)]
*  You will notice that the targets of these various fascist pro-Trump paramilitary groups [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=822.0s)]
*  like Patriot Front, Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, you'll notice that their targets are the political [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=826.6999999999999s)]
*  targets of our current Republican Party, right? The paramilitary groups are providing [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=831.96s)]
*  physical attacks, physical intimidation, to reinforce political attacks. Democrats and [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=836.08s)]
*  deep state actors are trying to steal the election. Well, these will be the groups that [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=841.44s)]
*  will be the tip of the spear that violently storm into the Capitol to stop that. Gay [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=845.12s)]
*  folks and trans folks are going after our children, right? Well, these groups will storm [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=850.0s)]
*  Pride festivals and supposedly objectionable children's story groups and menace people [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=856.0s)]
*  with weapons and with threats. They'll put physical force behind the political threats [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=861.4000000000001s)]
*  from the Republican Party. There are historical and sociological reasons behind the existence [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=866.12s)]
*  of fascist paramilitary organizations in the United States. This is not our first rodeo [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=872.0s)]
*  with these clowns. But it is a different thing altogether when paramilitary groups like this [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=876.44s)]
*  start playing a political function adjunct to one of the two major parties in our country. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=882.9200000000001s)]
*  That is a very, very bad sign. Police charging all 31 with conspiracy to riot, noting they [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=889.32s)]
*  plan to swarm several parts of Coeur d'Alene and carried paperwork similar to an operations [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=895.96s)]
*  plan that a police or military group would put together. They traveled in from states [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=901.12s)]
*  all across the country, allegedly united by white nationalism. They appear to be affiliated [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=905.88s)]
*  with the group Patriot Front. Why are white nationalists targeting a Pride parade in Idaho [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=911.24s)]
*  or anywhere? Historian Kathleen Ballew is the author of Bring the War Home, the White Power [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=918.4s)]
*  Movement in Paramilitary America. She's an expert on these kinds of movements. Professor Ballew, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=923.56s)]
*  thank you so much for making time for us tonight. Thank you for having me. So I've learned a lot of [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=927.64s)]
*  what I know about white power groups in this country and paramilitary movements in this country [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=933.92s)]
*  from your scholarship. But I wanted to ask you about this impression that I have from recent [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=938.8s)]
*  news from the sedition and indictments for the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys for what we saw [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=943.4399999999999s)]
*  this weekend in Idaho. I have this sense, this impression that these groups are now operating [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=947.84s)]
*  sort of as an adjunct, a pretty close adjunct to what's happening in very right wing electoral [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  politics. They seem to be targeting the same targets, at least that are being singled out [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=958.76s)]
*  by right wing Republican politicians. That feels unnerving to me. And I wanted to ask you if that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=964.24s)]
*  stands out to you. I think that's very concerning. And we don't know as much about that interface [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=968.72s)]
*  between mainstream politics and paramilitary white power activism and the militant right as we do [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=976.08s)]
*  about the fringe of the movement. But what we do know is that these groups are inherently [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=982.56s)]
*  opportunistic and they're prepared to use any open window to recruit and radicalize and foment [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=986.96s)]
*  violence. And it's worth just mentioning that when we say the word white nationalists, sometimes [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=993.28s)]
*  people think that means overzealous patriotism. But for these activists, the nation they envision [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=998.08s)]
*  is not the United States. It's a transnational group of white people. It is a white ethnostate. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1003.92s)]
*  It is not the America defined by democracy and multiculturalism and multiracial identity. That [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1009.76s)]
*  is the one that we live in. It is a imaginary all white state. So this is a very extremist movement. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1016.24s)]
*  It's drawing in people, as you mentioned, from all over the country. And the reason that we're seeing [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1022.16s)]
*  so many of these stories at the same time about Oath Keepers, Patriot Front, Proud Boys, the January [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1027.12s)]
*  6th hearings, all of these things are happening at the same time because this isn't a story about [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1032.64s)]
*  any one of these groups. This is a story about a groundswell. And even though it appears as [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1037.5200000000002s)]
*  disconnected pods of activism, it's meant to do that. What it is, is a nationwide paramilitary [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1043.0400000000002s)]
*  army that is prepared to do battle for its own purposes. Now, how much that can be wielded by [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1049.44s)]
*  the Republican Party, even on the very fringe, I think is open to question. What do you make of the [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1055.5200000000002s)]
*  reports, including from NBC News, that after arresting these Patriot Front members in Idaho, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1061.36s)]
*  the actual police officers who arrested some of them, the police department, are getting doxed [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1065.9199999999998s)]
*  and are getting threatened? Why are they threatening the police? Yeah, you know, this has been kind of a [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1070.56s)]
*  push pull on social media because often there has been a issue with overlap between some of these [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1075.6799999999998s)]
*  groups and some people in law enforcement. And I would not paint that with one brush at all. But, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1081.6799999999998s)]
*  you know, Coeur d'Alene has a long history of dealing with these movements. Coeur d'Alene was [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1087.68s)]
*  the site of the Aryan Nations compound, which is an epicenter for this activity in the 1980s. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1092.64s)]
*  It was nearby the headquarter actions for Phineas Priesthood, which is a similar movement in the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1098.72s)]
*  90s. Folks up there are not new to this and they're very aware of how violent it can become and how [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlmz8NczNU&t=1103.52s)]
