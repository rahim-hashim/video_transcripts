# As measles outbreak turns deadly, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. bungles the facts
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY)
*  Today at a cabinet meeting, they appear to have convened sort of mostly just for the cameras at the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=0.0s)]
*  Attention turned to the exploding outbreak of measles that started in West Texas and has now spread at least into New Mexico. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=6.5s)]
*  It's now at least 124 cases. A child has died, an unvaccinated school-aged child, who was hospitalized as of last week in the Lubbock area. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=14.5s)]
*  That child has now passed away. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=24.0s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. really is Donald Trump's idea of the best person in the whole country to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=27.5s)]
*  which is responsible for dealing with this kind of crisis. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=35.5s)]
*  Secretary Kennedy today attempted to give an update on the measles outbreak in front of the cameras, but almost every single thing he said about it was wrong. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=39.5s)]
*  He said, quote, It's not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=48.5s)]
*  Like this is a normal thing. I should mention for context in all of last year, we had 285 measles cases in the United States. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=53.5s)]
*  The year before that, for the whole year in the whole country, we had 59 cases, 59 cases, 59 cases, the whole country the whole year. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=61.5s)]
*  This one outbreak is already 124 cases and growing explosively. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=70.5s)]
*  And a child has died. This is the largest measles outbreak in Texas in at least 30 years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=76.5s)]
*  Inexplicably in his string of untrue statements about this ongoing measles epidemic that he is now responsible for fixing, Secretary Kennedy also misstated the number of deaths. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=82.5s)]
*  We are following the measles epidemic every day. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=94.5s)]
*  I think there's 124 people who have contracted measles at this point, mainly in Gaines County, Texas. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=99.5s)]
*  Mainly we're told in the Mennonite community, there are two people who have died. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=108.5s)]
*  But we're watching it and there are about 20 people hospitalized mainly for quarantine. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=116.5s)]
*  We're watching it. We put out a post on it yesterday and we're going to continue to follow it. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=126.5s)]
*  Local health authorities say it is not two people who have died. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=131.5s)]
*  It is one person who has died, an unvaccinated school age child. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=134.5s)]
*  Why he thinks it's two people who have died and not one, we don't know. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=138.5s)]
*  Also, the people who are hospitalized are not being hospitalized for quarantine, as he described it, which makes it seems like they're fine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=141.5s)]
*  They're just being kept in a room. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=149.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=151.5s)]
*  No, they've been hospitalized for respiratory distress and other serious and potential fatal symptoms of measles, which can kill you and which has already killed a child in this outbreak. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=153.5s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote a whole book about the measles in which he said that, quote, measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=164.5s)]
*  He wrote at the website of his anti vaccine group that getting measles is actually good for you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=175.5s)]
*  He says it is good for your heart to get measles, reduces the risk of some cancers and heart disease and stuff. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=182.5s)]
*  It's great. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=191.5s)]
*  Donald Trump put him in charge of health and human services for the whole country, and that means he's in charge of taking care of this explosive, you know, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=194.5s)]
*  outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=202.5s)]
*  Good call. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=207.5s)]
*  Safe hands. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=209.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALT16hXFhcY&t=232.5s)]
