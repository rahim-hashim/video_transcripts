# Trump bid to put off federal trial for years falls flat; Judges consult on speedy trial schedule
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8)
*  What this means in practical terms is that this hearing today was basically the opportunity for Trump's lawyers to defend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=0.0s)]
*  Their argument that they've already made to the court in print [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  that Trump's trial [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=11.44s)]
*  Federal trial for trying to overturn the election results shouldn't start for another two and a half years [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=13.88s)]
*  Shouldn't start until 2026 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=19.8s)]
*  Today was the hearing where they were going to defend that argument today judge Tanya Chetkin federal judge in DC [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=22.72s)]
*  Made clear they are not going to get their 2026 wish but how she got there was kind of amazing [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=28.16s)]
*  The judge quote now [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=34.6s)]
*  I want to note here that setting a trial date does not depend and should not depend on a [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=36.08s)]
*  On a defendant's personal and professional obligations. Mr [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=40.68s)]
*  Trump like any defendant will have to make the trial date work regardless of his schedule if this case for example [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=44.2s)]
*  Involved a professional athlete it would be inappropriate for me to schedule a trial date to accommodate her schedule [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=49.92s)]
*  The same is true here among other things the public has an interest in the fair and timely [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=55.42s)]
*  administration of justice as well as reducing defendants opportunity to commit crimes while on pretrial release and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=61.42s)]
*  Preventing extended pretrial delay from impairing the deterrent effect of punishment [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  prosecutors then [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=75.18s)]
*  Tried to sort of bolster that point from the judge. Ms. Gaston the prosecutor says quote the defendant [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=76.62s)]
*  Formerly the senior most official in our federal government is accused of historic crimes [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=83.14s)]
*  Attempting to overturn the presidential election [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=88.22s)]
*  Disenfranchised millions of Americans and obstruct the peaceful transfer of power [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=90.89999999999999s)]
*  There's an incredibly strong public interest in a jury's prompt and full consideration of those claims in open court [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=94.66s)]
*  And there's also a strong public interest in a fair trial [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=101.17999999999999s)]
*  Which means we need to proceed to trial as soon as the defense can be ready [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=104.78s)]
*  Reasonably because on a near daily basis the defendant posts on social media about this case. He has publicly disparaged witnesses [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=109.42s)]
*  He's attacked the integrity of the courts and of the citizens of the District of Columbia who make up our jury pool and this [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=116.7s)]
*  Potentially prejudices the jury pool. So under the speedy trial act your honor. We need to find a time for trial when [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  Well as soon as the defense can reasonably be ready [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=129.62s)]
*  So that's the judge saying [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=134.3s)]
*  Listen the public has an interest in a speedy trial here. There's the prosecutor saying oh, yes, they do [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=136.5s)]
*  When the judge though attempts to have a discussion about what would be a reasonable amount of time for Trump's defense lawyers to go through [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=144.62s)]
*  all the evidence [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  That was a very heated portion of today's hearing the judge found herself repeatedly instructing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=152.3s)]
*  Trump's lawyer basically to calm down [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=159.58s)]
*  Quote mr. Loro defense counsel [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=162.74s)]
*  This is a request for a show trial not a speedy trial and I'm sorry your honor to suggest for a federal prosecutor [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=164.74s)]
*  To suggest that we could go to trial in four months is not only absurd [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=170.94s)]
*  But it's a violation of the oath to do justice and let me just go through this organized material [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=175.26000000000002s)]
*  And then the judge interrupts the judge. Okay, let's take the temperature down for a moment here [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=180.74s)]
*  But Trump's lawyer goes on mr [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  Loro quote for the government to suggest that I can do that in four months as an outrage to justice [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=188.86s)]
*  That not once have they talked about justice in this case not once so what this is what I have to do [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=193.5s)]
*  Now they can give me key documents. That's very nice of them. That's very kind of them [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=199.1s)]
*  I'd like to know one defense lawyer in the United States that's going to rely on a government's proposal of key documents [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=203.24s)]
*  judge [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=210.74s)]
*  Mr. Loro as I said [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=211.82s)]
*  Let's take the temperature down [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=214.06s)]
*  In the end judge check in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=218.54s)]
*  scheduled the trial for March 4th not of 2026 but of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=220.54s)]
*  next year [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  Judge says quote the offense giving rise to this case occurred at the end of 2020 in the beginning of 2021 [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=228.1s)]
*  To propose trying this case over five years later [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=233.85999999999999s)]
*  Risks the real danger that witnesses may become unavailable or their memories may fade and while mr [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=237.7s)]
*  Trump has a has a top has a right to time to prepare [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  The public has a right to a prompt and efficient resolution of this matter [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=245.82s)]
*  This timeline does not move the case forward with the haste of the mob [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  The trial will start three years one month and 27 days after the events of January 6th, 2021 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=254.1s)]
*  So March 4th jury selection begins. Here's one other thing that judge Chetkin said today [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=261.85999999999996s)]
*  I think is worth noting and actually worth getting some advice about [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=266.73999999999995s)]
*  The judge said today quote. I realized that mr. Trump's criminal case in New York is scheduled for trial on March 25th [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  I did speak briefly with judge Mershon the New York judge [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=276.74s)]
*  To let him know that I was considering a date that might overlap with his trial [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=280.74s)]
*  So she's explaining the two sides why she's picking this date noting that it's other than the trial [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=285.78s)]
*  Up against the the New York date, but she says she's spoken to the judge [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=291.46s)]
*  Interesting I mean trump obviously has many trials coming up in the next year [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=296.9s)]
*  There is that one in New York on dozens of state felony charges [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=300.73999999999995s)]
*  There's also the classified documents trial in federal court in florida [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  And prosecutors in those various cases [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=307.85999999999996s)]
*  May not themselves be talking to each other, but the judges apparently are talking to each other [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=310.41999999999996s)]
*  Judge chuckin saying in open court today that she has spoken to the judge [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=316.41999999999996s)]
*  For example in trump's new york case to give him a heads up to help [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=320.34s)]
*  Deconflict between at least those two trials and while that might seem common sense [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  That's the first time we have seen anyone in any position of authority playing the role of air traffic controllers [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=329.94s)]
*  For all of these trials that are all going to be trying to land in the same year [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  You [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  You [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwYKw52aCg8&t=363.29999999999995s)]
