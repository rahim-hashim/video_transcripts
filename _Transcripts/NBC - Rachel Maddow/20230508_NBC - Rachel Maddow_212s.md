# Why being Latino and also a neo-Nazi are not mutually exclusive
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU)
*  Kathleen, I wanted to ask you one last question [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=0.0s)]
*  about this young man who's the apparent shooter from Allen, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=2.0s)]
*  Texas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=5.96s)]
*  He appears to be Latino. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=7.08s)]
*  And there's been a lot of discussion about the fact [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  that he's identifying himself as per reporting, essentially [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  with the Nazi movement and the neo-Nazi movement [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=15.72s)]
*  and advancing white supremacists and anti-Semitic views. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  As a man who appears to be Latino himself, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=21.44s)]
*  how do you describe that as a dynamic here, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=24.78s)]
*  somebody who's studied the white power movement? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=27.48s)]
*  So I think this is relatively new. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=30.28s)]
*  And it's critically important to understand, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=32.4s)]
*  because this claim to a neo-Nazi set of ideas [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=34.4s)]
*  by someone who might be classified as Latino [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=40.0s)]
*  in many US settings is true not just for the Allen gunmen, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=43.64s)]
*  but for many other people, including other people [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=49.64s)]
*  in the Proud Boys. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=52.64s)]
*  And we don't know yet whether the gunman was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=54.32s)]
*  part of Proud Boys. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=56.76s)]
*  Certainly, he was wearing patches that, as you mentioned, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=57.68s)]
*  are sold by Proud Boys. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  But there's a direct linkage between something [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  like right-wing death squad and the slogan that comes with it, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=65.96s)]
*  which is Pinochet was right, to Latin American ideas [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  about whiteness. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=73.88s)]
*  So Pinochet is the infamous Argentinian dictator [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=74.92s)]
*  who dealt with his political enemies. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=78.6s)]
*  Often, many of the enemies were characterized [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=81.92s)]
*  as racial others by simply throwing them out [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=85.16s)]
*  of helicopters over the ocean. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  Proud Boys were wearing shirts that said Pinochet was right, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=89.84s)]
*  right-wing death squad, way back, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=92.92s)]
*  even before the last round of presidential debates, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=95.6s)]
*  long before January 6. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=99.36s)]
*  So these things are imbricated. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  And the other thing to understand, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=102.96s)]
*  and this has a long history. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=104.36s)]
*  It's complex. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=106.32s)]
*  I'll do it here just very quickly. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=107.12s)]
*  But people can read more about this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=108.64s)]
*  Ideas about whiteness and what counts as white [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=110.72s)]
*  and who might be under the umbrella of being included [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=113.48s)]
*  in Nazism are very, very different from country [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=117.2s)]
*  to country. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=120.56s)]
*  One of the striking things in the Allen, Texas shooters [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=121.36s)]
*  purported social media are images [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=125.56s)]
*  of people who in the United States [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=128.0s)]
*  would present as Latino wearing Nazi dress, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=130.2s)]
*  and not just the shooter. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=133.8s)]
*  Groups and groups of people wearing Nazi uniforms, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=134.88s)]
*  wearing Nazi symbols, and really taking on this ideology [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=138.0s)]
*  as their own. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=143.4s)]
*  In Latin America, there is often a different racial hierarchy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=144.36s)]
*  Whiteness has to do with a larger amount [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=147.68s)]
*  of Spanish heritage and a smaller amount of indigenous [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=151.36s)]
*  or African heritage. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=154.52s)]
*  And all of these ideas are socially constructed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=156.36s)]
*  So this is difficult, but the outcome [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=158.96s)]
*  is not difficult to understand. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=161.84s)]
*  The outcome is anti-American targeted violence [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=164.4s)]
*  at communities of color, Jewish communities, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=168.44s)]
*  other sort of racial enemy communities, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=171.0s)]
*  and at our institutions of democratic governance. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=173.88s)]
*  Kathleen Ballou, Associate Professor of History [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  at Northwestern University. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=179.0s)]
*  Kathleen, thank you for your time and your expertise tonight. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=180.24s)]
*  I appreciate you being here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=184.36s)]
*  I will mention Pinochet Chilean, not Argentinian. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  A slip of the tongue there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  But other than that, we will be right back. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=189.84s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb2COhSncsU&t=191.60000000000002s)]
