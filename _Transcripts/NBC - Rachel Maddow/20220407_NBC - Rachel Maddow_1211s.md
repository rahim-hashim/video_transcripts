# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 6
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o)
*  We spent a good deal of tonight's show talking about Russian disinformation and anti-democratic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=0.0s)]
*  behavior. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=5.72s)]
*  Of course, back home in the United States, we've had to contend with our fair share of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=6.72s)]
*  both. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=10.0s)]
*  You may recall the fraudulent electors scheme conducted as part of Donald Trump and his [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=11.0s)]
*  allies' attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 election. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=15.36s)]
*  Trump allies in at least seven states, one by President Biden, signed election certification [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=19.52s)]
*  documents falsely declaring themselves the real electors, even though they weren't. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=24.92s)]
*  That fake elector plot overseen by Trump campaign officials, including Rudy Giuliani, is now [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=30.82s)]
*  being investigated by the Justice Department. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  At least eight of the 84 Republicans who signed their names falsely listing themselves as [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=38.28s)]
*  electors were elected officeholders. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=43.72s)]
*  One of those elected officials was Kelly Rue. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=47.28s)]
*  She's an older person for a town in Wisconsin, though she won't be for much longer. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=49.92s)]
*  Fraudulent elector Kelly Rue was up for a second term of office as a municipal official [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  in De Pere, Wisconsin. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=60.0s)]
*  It's just south of Green Bay. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  And last night, Rue, just like the former president she supported, lost her bid for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  re-election. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=68.56s)]
*  In a triumph for Wisconsin Democrats, Pamela Gantz, a volunteer poll worker, ousted Rue [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=69.64s)]
*  by 118 votes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=75.72s)]
*  The Democratic state party chair tweeted that the victory was, quote, a win in a small election [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=78.32s)]
*  that sends a big message. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=83.18s)]
*  If you try to undermine Wisconsin's democracy, you will be held accountable. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=85.26s)]
*  Voters like democracy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=90.58000000000001s)]
*  Gantz herself spoke to a voting rights-focused magazine immediately after her win and told [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=93.22000000000001s)]
*  them, quote, I promise not to use my position to influence any national elections or support [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=97.62s)]
*  conspiracies. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=103.5s)]
*  I promise to keep it local and promote fair and free elections for our community, end [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=104.5s)]
*  quote. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=110.02000000000001s)]
*  So now that the Russian troops are gone, the press can finally get a closer look. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  But no matter what the Western press finds, Russian press is likely ready to say that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=115.82000000000001s)]
*  what we see was either staged or carried out by an extremist Nazi faction within Ukraine. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=120.56s)]
*  So how does the West help tackle this problem, especially if Russia can just create its own [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  reality out of whole cloth and tell their people whatever they want? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=131.74s)]
*  Joining us now is Alana Minkovsky. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=136.74s)]
*  She's a Russian-American journalist who worked at the Russian state-run news agency RT America [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=138.74s)]
*  from 2009 to 2012. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=143.78s)]
*  She also brings a unique insight into what's going on in Russia. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=146.5s)]
*  Her mother is currently a member of the Duma, the Russian parliament. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=149.94s)]
*  Alana, thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=153.3s)]
*  Talk to me about this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=156.18s)]
*  Do you think the Russian people are going to buy the idea that neo-Nazi Ukrainians are [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=157.18s)]
*  trying to enact some sort of anti-Russian Holocaust? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=161.9s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Oli. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=167.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, of course, not all Russian people are going to buy this, are buying it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=168.46s)]
*  You do see small little moments of people still trying to protest in the quietest, most [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=173.5s)]
*  brave ways that they can, considering how dangerous it is to do there in that society. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=179.5s)]
*  Right now, we've seen people putting crosses out there in order to honor the people that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=184.34s)]
*  were massacred in Buche. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  But at the same time, you have to realize that there is an informational vacuum in Russia [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=191.5s)]
*  right now that the only real news that most Russians are seeing, except for those who [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=197.34s)]
*  go out of their way to get a VPN, who are seeking out that information, is coming from [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=202.82s)]
*  the official channels on TV, on radio. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=207.22s)]
*  And those are the channels that are spreading these stories that you're showing that are [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=210.42000000000002s)]
*  terrifying and also baffling in how outrageous and outlandish the lies are getting. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=214.78s)]
*  And yet these are coming from the official channels from the government. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=220.78s)]
*  And so, you know, a lot of Russian people will believe them and will buy into them. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=225.26s)]
*  And you know, the other thing is the more and more you hear something repeated, no matter [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=230.34s)]
*  how untrue it is, you might start to buy it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=233.7s)]
*  So help me understand this, because certainly in America, we know no matter what type of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  news you consume or where it is on the political spectrum, you're aware that there's news from [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=243.38s)]
*  somewhere else on the political spectrum. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  And I'm assuming that's similar in Russia. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=251.18s)]
*  So how are Russian people being sold on the idea that there was an independent press that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=253.74s)]
*  just up and vanished? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=259.38s)]
*  Well, I think everything that you're seeing here has been part of a years long effort, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=261.34000000000003s)]
*  you know, within Russia by Putin's regime to kind of normalize and prime the Russian [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=269.66s)]
*  public for what's happening right now. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=274.86s)]
*  It starts with just this nostalgia for World War Two, patriotism and bravery and Russia. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=277.06s)]
*  That's something that has been nurtured. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=283.54s)]
*  There have been these Victory Day parades. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  One is coming up on May 9th in Russia, you know, that has kind of sparned the collective [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=287.3s)]
*  memory of what it was that the Soviet people did during World War Two to fight back Nazis. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=293.14000000000004s)]
*  And don't forget, 27 million Soviet Union residents or people were estimated to have [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=298.58000000000004s)]
*  died during that conflict. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=304.82000000000005s)]
*  My grandparents took part in it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=307.34000000000003s)]
*  You know, every Russian has some relative family member. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=309.14000000000004s)]
*  They can relate to their so it's a real manipulation of this kind of collective memory to use that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=312.7s)]
*  and then now start building this narrative of Nazism within the Ukrainian government. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=319.26s)]
*  And so, you know, it's just these kind of slow drips of information of resentment against [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=326.86s)]
*  the West that I think have primed people to slowly start normalizing, accepting the dehumanizing [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=331.06s)]
*  and an increasingly radical information that they're starting to get there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=338.62s)]
*  I don't know how you necessarily break through it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=343.1s)]
*  As I mentioned, there are still people who don't believe this. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=345.66s)]
*  Perhaps it's a scary environment for them to talk about it, but they're using VPNs. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  They're accessing other information. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=354.46s)]
*  You know, so many young people that have grown up in Russia with access to the internet, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=356.86s)]
*  with access to an independent media. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=361.5s)]
*  I don't think that they're just going to forget that that existed. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=363.9s)]
*  But how to create a political environment where Putin's regime can still [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=367.26s)]
*  can be stopped in that way, you know, by those people, I think that's the bigger question. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=375.34s)]
*  Alana, it is a big question and we thank you for helping us at least get started in this [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=382.78s)]
*  discussion. Alana Minkovsky, Alona Miskat Minkovsky is a Russian American journalist [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=386.38s)]
*  and we thank you for your time tonight. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=390.62s)]
*  Now, if you've been watching our coverage of the war in Ukraine these past six weeks, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=392.14s)]
*  you've probably heard me mention something called the Azov battalion. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=397.18s)]
*  It's one of the more complicated and controversial parts of the story of Ukraine's defense against [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=401.18s)]
*  the Russian invasion. The Azov battalion began as a far right ultra nationalist militia that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=405.97999999999996s)]
*  sprung up to fight Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. The group was known to have ties to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=412.14s)]
*  neo-Nazi movements and its leader was even quoted once as saying Ukraine's purpose was to, quote, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=418.22s)]
*  lead the white races of the world in a final crusade against semi-led [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=423.58000000000004s)]
*  Untermenschen, Untermenschen being the Nazi term for inferior races. Their members were [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=430.22s)]
*  known to display Nazi iconography on their uniforms and today that same group has about [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=436.94000000000005s)]
*  10,000 forces fighting Russia across Ukraine. It's been incorporated now into the Ukrainian [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=441.82s)]
*  military and is leading the fight against Russia in places like Mariupol on behalf of a pluralistic [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=448.46s)]
*  liberal Ukrainian government led by a Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=455.58s)]
*  So like I said, this is complicated. The Azov battalion of today denies being motivated by any [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=461.26s)]
*  neo-Nazi or fascist ideology. They say they've grown to include fighters of all different [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=468.22s)]
*  ideologies, though they admit they still count neo-Nazis among their ranks. Now Russian president [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=473.82000000000005s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has tried to use the Azov battalion's ties to the far right as justification for his [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=480.54s)]
*  campaign of so-called denazification in Ukraine and we're going to talk more about that a little [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=486.70000000000005s)]
*  later on in the show. It's no secret that war makes for strange bedfellows. Ironically, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=492.53999999999996s)]
*  the most famous example of this is probably the alliance between Western countries and the Soviet [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=497.97999999999996s)]
*  Union in World War II. Between 1939 and 1941, almost two years, the Soviet Union and Germany, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=503.73999999999995s)]
*  Nazi Germany, were allies. That worked until Hitler decided to invade the Soviet Union in 1941. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=512.06s)]
*  But the question of how to think about the Azov battalion looms large today. The Washington Post, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=518.38s)]
*  Sudarsan Raghavan, along with three other post reporters, published a new detailed report today [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=524.9399999999999s)]
*  examining the Azov battalion's role in the current fight against Russia. He interviewed fighters from [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=530.86s)]

*  soldiers with whom he spoke had neo-Nazi tattoos and espoused far-right ideologies. The leader of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=541.18s)]
*  the Azov battalion told the Washington Post that their force now includes writers and other liberals, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=547.66s)]
*  even members of the extreme left and anti-fascists. Quote, we are at war for the very existence of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=553.9s)]
*  Ukraine at the moment. In the past month, I've never asked a person that came to join us [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=560.9399999999999s)]
*  about his political views. Today, Ukrainians have only one option of political orientation [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=565.66s)]
*  for or against Ukraine, end quote. He told the Washington Post that they are trying to weed out [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=571.9s)]
*  the neo-Nazi tattoos and other symbols among Azov fighters, but in the current war, he cannot afford [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=577.02s)]
*  to lose any soldier because of political ideology left or right. Quote, every soldier that fights for [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=582.62s)]
*  Ukraine is of value now, he said, and of value to the Western world because if Ukraine will break, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=589.34s)]
*  the next in trouble will be the collective West, end quote. Joining us now is Sudarsan Raghavan, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=595.18s)]
*  a Washington Post correspondent who is the lead byline on that report. He's just left Ukraine after [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=600.86s)]
*  a long time here. Sudarsan, good to see you. What did the soldiers you talked to think about the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=605.98s)]
*  Azov battalion's bad history? Good to be with you, Ali. So the soldiers we spoke to were pretty much [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=614.0600000000001s)]
*  dismissive of the Azov's neo-Nazi links. I mean, in fact, everyone we spoke to believed that this [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=624.94s)]
*  was all part of Russian propaganda, and the many of them who joined the, those who joined the forces [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=632.38s)]
*  had friends already in the forces, and they didn't see them, they didn't perceive their friends as [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=639.3399999999999s)]
*  Nazis or other forms of, expousing other forms of extremism. What do you make of [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=644.38s)]
*  of Vladimir Putin's use of the Azov battalion as justification for the idea that Ukraine needs [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=655.02s)]
*  denazification? Right, you know, the thinking on the Azov is outdated from what we found. I mean, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=664.14s)]
*  it's based on what happened eight years ago and all those statements you mentioned earlier that [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=672.0600000000001s)]
*  came out publicly, but since then, there's been a big effort, certainly by the Ukrainians, to [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=679.34s)]
*  alter the Azov. I mean, when they joined the Ukraine's National Guard, there were strong [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=686.5400000000001s)]
*  efforts to weed out extremists within the ranks. Also, we're looking at a much different [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=692.62s)]
*  situation here in this war. I mean, it's less about political ideology, more about patriotism, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=700.22s)]
*  and just moral outrage of what the Russians are doing in Ukraine, especially with all of the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=706.38s)]
*  civilian casualties that we've been seeing and all the brutal potential war crimes that have [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=712.9399999999999s)]
*  been unfolding by Russia. So, yeah, so I mean, it's an outdated view. And it's also, I mean, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=718.86s)]
*  you have to understand that what Vladimir Putin is saying is something about a very small amount [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=725.9s)]
*  of Ukrainian society. Even the analysts we spoke to, the fighters we spoke to, leaders say, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=733.34s)]
*  yes, there are still extremists amongst our ranks, but it's a very small portion. And one [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=738.62s)]
*  clear indication of how small the far-right elements are in Ukraine is that the political [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=742.46s)]
*  arm of the Azov ran for elections a couple of years ago, and they only generated about 2% of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=748.62s)]
*  the entire vote, even when they combined with other far-right parties. So the battalion is [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=755.74s)]
*  extremely popular because they are fighting in Mariupol and not only defending Ukraine. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=761.58s)]
*  But in terms of the political arm, it doesn't generate that much popularity in Ukraine. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=767.26s)]
*  You know, obviously, men of a fighting age are not allowed to leave the country. The president has [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=775.98s)]
*  invited people back. You and I both have run into people in Kyiv or in Lviv who have come from other [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=781.1800000000001s)]
*  countries to fight. They may be of Ukrainian heritage. Some of them are Canadians and Americans [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=787.66s)]
*  who come here. Why would anybody join the Azov battalion as opposed to the open invitation to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=791.5799999999999s)]
*  join the Ukrainian military or the National Guard? Right, it's a very good question. I mean, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=797.02s)]
*  a clear answer is that this is one of the most adept fighting units in Ukraine right now, and [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=805.02s)]
*  they're considered to many Ukrainians heroes, especially because of what their special forces [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=811.66s)]
*  units are doing in Mariupol. They've been able to literally single-handedly hold down, prevent the [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=816.86s)]
*  Russians from taking entire control of the whole city. So there's a lot of goodwill from that. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=822.54s)]
*  I think the second thing is, look, it's impossible to avoid, to prevent any kind of extremists coming [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=827.58s)]
*  from Europe or the United States to join the Azov. I mean, the analysts we spoke to said [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=834.3000000000001s)]
*  that there are still coming, but it's a very small number. So perhaps that is one reason. I mean, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=839.1s)]
*  the danger, of course, is which we won't know now. Perhaps we'll learn in a few months or even years, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=843.8199999999999s)]
*  is that whether or not some extremists did join the Azov and will return back to their home countries [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=849.9s)]
*  and possibly engage in violence or some sort of anti-government activity. But we don't know that [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=855.5s)]
*  for sure. For now, the big concern amongst everyone here is just liberals, left-wing, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=862.78s)]
*  right-wing, is getting together, picking up arms and fighting back the Russians. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=869.82s)]
*  Tim Snyder is a professor of history at Yale University. He's authored best-selling books [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=877.9000000000001s)]
*  about authoritarian regimes, books like On Tyranny, 20 Lessons from the 20th Century, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=882.22s)]
*  and The Road to Unfreedom, Russia, Europe, America, also Bloodlands, Europe Between Hitler and Stalin. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=887.34s)]
*  Tim Snyder has been studying authoritarianism for years. So when he's got something to say about [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=895.1800000000001s)]
*  Putin's war in Ukraine, I listen. Snyder wrote today that Vladimir Putin is intent on crushing [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=899.18s)]
*  the Ukrainian people, but at great cost to Russia. In his piece entitled By Denying a Ukrainian [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=905.42s)]
*  Culture, Putin Flattens His Own, Snyder writes, quote, Vladimir Putin wants to crush people into [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=911.3399999999999s)]
*  one. He says, God told him that Ukrainian souls are Russian. History revealed to him that Ukraine [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=917.02s)]
*  strives to be one with Russia, the very language he speaks and titles him to invade any country, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=923.0999999999999s)]
*  where Russia is spoken. An official news service removed any ambiguity a few days ago, publishing [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=929.1s)]
*  a text advocating the complete elimination of the Ukrainian nation as such. And so Ukraine must be [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=935.5s)]
*  crushed and anyone who thinks or speaks of Ukraine must be eliminated, end quote. Joining us now is [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=943.1s)]
*  Professor Timothy Snyder. He's a professor of history at Yale University. Professor Snyder, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=949.9s)]
*  thank you for being with us tonight. We talked earlier in the show about how Russia is using [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=954.0600000000001s)]
*  propaganda and disinformation. Your piece today focuses on what this war is doing to Russian [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=958.86s)]
*  culture and identity. I'd love if you could tell us a bit about that. Yeah, I mean, the central idea [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=965.9000000000001s)]
*  of empire is that the other side has no state. The other side has no nation. Therefore, we, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=974.38s)]
*  the superior people here, the Russians have the right to go in and say who should be in charge [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=981.4200000000001s)]
*  and who is who. But the problem is that as you attempt to carry out these things, you find [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=986.7s)]
*  yourself confronted with a real state and a real people who resist you. And as you attempt to crush [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=992.7800000000001s)]
*  them, you do terrible things to yourself. I mean, as you showed in the last segment, the attempt to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=998.22s)]
*  justify, you know, to find some kind of circular logic that makes all of this somehow acceptable [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1002.94s)]
*  or understandable, forces you into all kinds of contortions. And by the end of it, you know, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1008.38s)]
*  the word propaganda doesn't even really begin to describe it. I mean, this is just a kind of [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1014.54s)]
*  perverted hate speech. And when all you've got is television and all television is doing is this [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1018.3s)]
*  kind of hate speech, then at the end of the day, among many other evils you've committed is a kind [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1023.98s)]
*  of destruction of your own culture. As a lot of Minkowski said in the last segment, tens of millions [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1028.78s)]
*  of Russian Soviets died at the hands of the Nazis. So this idea that neo-Nazis are running [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1037.58s)]
*  Ukraine and the country needs to be denazified sounds bizarre to many people in our audience. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1044.78s)]
*  But maybe that's why it was settled on by Putin as the reason given to many Russians in support [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1051.1s)]
*  of the invasion. I mean, one thing that we have to just say about the history is that we have to [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1056.6999999999998s)]
*  remember that more Ukrainian civilians, not just proportionally, but in absolute terms, died in the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1061.98s)]
*  Second World War than Russian civilians. And Ukrainian soldiers also died in huge numbers [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1067.98s)]
*  fighting the German army. More Ukrainian soldiers died fighting the Germans, not just than Americans, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1073.58s)]
*  but than Americans and Frenchmen and British combined. So I just say that because Ukrainians [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1078.78s)]
*  also have every right to interpret the Second World War. And it's quite reasonable of them to say [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1085.18s)]
*  the Second World War is about somebody invading Ukraine. And right now someone is invading Ukraine. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1091.02s)]
*  But as to the Nazi business, I think it's very important to understand what's happening here. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1096.7s)]
*  The word Nazi has been stripped of any content. It is just a kind of general condemnation. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1100.94s)]
*  There was an article on Sunday, an official Russian press service called Lidia Novosti, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1108.62s)]
*  which made this very clear. It called for the complete destruction of the Ukrainian nation, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1113.1s)]
*  beginning with the murder of everyone who identifies with it, on the logic that all [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1118.3s)]
*  Ukrainians are Nazis. But it cleared something up. It said that what we mean by Nazi is not that they [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1122.54s)]
*  actually have any objective characteristics of a Nazi. It just means they're not Russian. They [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1128.46s)]
*  refuse to be Russian. They insist that it's unsaying that they're Ukrainian or European. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1133.26s)]
*  That's what we mean by Nazi. And frankly, that's very clarifying because what they're admitting [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1137.8999999999999s)]
*  here is that all they mean by Nazi is not us. But the other consequence of that is that when you [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1143.02s)]
*  strip the word Nazi of any meaning, you can't notice when you yourself are doing things that [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1148.46s)]
*  are very much like what the Nazis did. You don't notice that you've just invaded the country, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1154.62s)]
*  that you're trying to destroy its educated classes, right? You can't notice that because [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1158.94s)]
*  all the word Nazi means is the other people. It is that's enlightening. And it's one of the [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1163.26s)]
*  reasons why you and others, when writing about authoritarianism and things like that, are very [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1171.82s)]
*  specific with your language in that the Holocaust doesn't mean all things and Nazi doesn't mean [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1176.62s)]
*  all things. They have specific meanings. We appreciate it. Timothy Snyder is the author [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1181.6599999999999s)]
*  of On Tyranny. He's a professor of history at Yale University. And as always, sir, we thank you for [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IhuPqce99o&t=1185.4199999999998s)]
