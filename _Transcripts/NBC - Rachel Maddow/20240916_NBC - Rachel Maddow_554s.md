# Clinton: Take Trump at his word and be outraged by what he represents
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E)
*  Joining us now is Secretary Clinton, former Democratic presidential nominee, Secretary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=0.0s)]
*  of State, U.S. Senator, First Lady. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=3.96s)]
*  Her new book is called Something Lost, Something Gained, Reflections on Life, Love and Liberty. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=5.66s)]
*  It comes out tomorrow. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=11.16s)]
*  I got halfway through my preview copy of the book and immediately ordered it for my mom [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=12.56s)]
*  and dad. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=17.14s)]
*  Secretary Clinton, thank you so much for being here tonight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=18.14s)]
*  It's a real pleasure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=20.76s)]
*  RACHEL, it is always good to be with you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=21.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  I am struck by the fact that as his campaign careens into very, very offensive territory, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=26.58s)]
*  the association with Holocaust deniers and the outrages at Arlington National Cemetery [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=33.1s)]
*  of all places, the insults to recipients of the Medal of Honor, the recent incredibly [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  racist and dangerous lies about specific groups of immigrants, Haitians in this case, and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=48.459999999999994s)]
*  Venezuelans in the case of Colorado, I am struck by the fact that as much as we thought [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=55.88s)]
*  we might have been inoculated against sort of outrage tactics like that, where everything [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=61.24s)]
*  else gets thrown by the wayside and everybody starts responding to his outraged du jour, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=66.28s)]
*  it's a way of sort of yanking everybody's chain, I sort of feel like we haven't learned. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=71.28s)]
*  And he's still being taught, especially by the media, that the more offensive he is, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=76.32s)]
*  the more he can dominate the media space entirely. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=82.68s)]
*  And I feel like you've been a good diagnoser of that, not only from when you were up against [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=87.02000000000001s)]
*  him, but from when others have done so. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=92.06s)]
*  Do you have an antidote for that or a way that people can talk themselves out of taking [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=94.22000000000001s)]
*  that bait? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=98.74000000000001s)]
*  I think that's really a critical question, and I think there's a couple of things going [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=102.02000000000001s)]
*  on here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=106.54s)]
*  You mentioned the press, and sadly the press is still not able to cover Trump the way that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=107.8s)]
*  they should. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=115.0s)]
*  They careen from one outrage to the next. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=116.12s)]
*  What was outrageous three days ago is no longer on the front pages, even though it threatens [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=119.16s)]
*  the physical safety of so many people, particularly as you point out, immigrants that he and Vance [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=124.6s)]
*  have decided to demonize. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=131.44s)]
*  I don't understand why it's so difficult for the press to have a consistent narrative [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=135.01999999999998s)]
*  about how dangerous Trump is. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=140.54s)]
*  The late great journalist, Harry Evans, one time said that journalists should really try [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=144.22s)]
*  to achieve objectivity, and by that he said, I mean, they should cover the object. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=154.3s)]
*  The object in this case is Donald Trump, his demagoguery, his danger to our country and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=159.84s)]
*  the world, and stick with it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=167.32s)]
*  They were merciless about what they saw as President Biden's problems in the debate and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=170.8s)]
*  calling for him to withdraw. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=179.8s)]
*  I believe Donald Trump has disqualified himself over and over and over again to be a presidential [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=182.6s)]
*  candidate, let alone a president. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=189.76s)]
*  The second thing, though, is that part of what Trump is counting on is for people to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  get desensitized. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=199.1s)]
*  I mean, oh, my gosh, did you hear what he said yesterday? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=200.82s)]
*  Did you hear who he attacked? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=204.01999999999998s)]
*  Did you hear the viciousness? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=205.54s)]
*  And it's just like with a shrug, OK, fine, we're moving on. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, Americans need to understand that they have to take Trump both seriously and literally. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=211.94s)]
*  He has said what he wants to do. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=219.04s)]
*  He and his allies with Project 2025, his desire to be a dictator, at least on day one, all [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=221.32s)]
*  of that is in the public record. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=229.0s)]
*  And I believe that more Americans have to be willing to endure what frankly is discomforting [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=232.2s)]
*  and to some extent kind of painful, to take him at his word and to be outraged by what [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=241.46s)]
*  he represents. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=249.34s)]
*  And then finally, the hopeful side of this is that I do think more and more Americans [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=250.34s)]
*  are rejecting the kind of chaos that he represents. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=256.66s)]
*  We can't go back. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=262.26s)]
*  That's what the Harris campaign says all the time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=264.14s)]
*  We're not going back. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  We're not going back to what he failed to do to protect American lives during COVID. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=267.76s)]
*  We're not going back to the romance with dictators that puts innocent lives at risk and America's [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  security in danger. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=282.04s)]
*  We can't go back and give this very dangerous man another chance to do harm to our country [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=284.44s)]
*  and the world. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=292.52s)]
*  Speaking of dictators, the Justice Department and the State Department have taken a number [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=294.66s)]
*  of actions in the past several weeks, striking actions to both call out and indict and take [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=299.94s)]
*  action against the Kremlin for their attempts at interfering in this and yet another presidential [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=306.14000000000004s)]
*  election cycle on Trump's behalf. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=314.42s)]
*  The State Department has put out a $10 million reward for information about entities that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=317.02s)]
*  are trying to illegally interfere in our election. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=326.56s)]
*  We've seen these dramatic indictments from the Justice Department, including for paying [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=329.2s)]
*  millions of dollars, the Kremlin paying millions of dollars to pro-Trump influencers. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  We've seen the Justice Department seize web domains where the Kremlin had set up news [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  sites, what looked like news sites, looked like versions of American news sites, but [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=344.58000000000004s)]
*  were secretly operated by the Russian intelligence services or by the Russian government. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=347.98s)]
*  Do you feel like the U.S. government is sort of starting to figure out how to do this and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=352.74s)]
*  taking this seriously enough, or do you still think there's a far distance to go? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=357.22s)]
*  I think there's a far distance to go. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=363.18s)]
*  I applaud the actions taken by the Justice Department and the State Department. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=364.94000000000005s)]
*  I think that they're very important, but truly we are just at the beginning of uncovering [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=370.9s)]
*  everything that Russia, but not just Russia, other countries have done and are doing to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=379.4s)]
*  influence our election. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=386.46s)]
*  If you focus on Russia, and I commend you, Rachel, for your new movie, because we are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=388.2s)]
*  only at the beginning of understanding the whole iceberg here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=394.4s)]
*  What the Russians started doing in 2015 and 2016, what they continued doing, they've [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=399.52s)]
*  gotten more sophisticated. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  They aren't even pretending anymore. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=407.88s)]
*  Their international news operation, Russia Today, RT, is an arm of the Russian government, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=410.68s)]
*  an arm of its intelligence operation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=419.84s)]
*  It's basically an extension of their spying efforts. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=421.84s)]
*  They are using Americans, both those who are witting and willing and those who are [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=426.84s)]
*  unwitting and are just so surprised. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=432.67999999999995s)]
*  They're getting $400,000 a week or $100,000 a podcast to parrot Kremlin propaganda. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=435.11999999999995s)]
*  We know from what even Republicans have said, the chairs of the Intelligence Committee and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=443.88s)]
*  the Foreign Affairs Committee and other Republicans who are currently in office have said that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=449.79999999999995s)]
*  Republicans go to the floor of the Congress and they parrot Russian talking points. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=456.76s)]
*  I think it's important to indict the Russians, just as Mueller indicted a lot of Russians [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=462.88s)]
*  who were engaged in direct election interference and boosting Trump back in 2016. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=469.36s)]
*  I also think there are Americans who are engaged in this kind of propaganda, and whether they [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=477.36s)]
*  should be civilly or even in some cases criminally charged is something that would be a better [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  deterrence because the Russians are unlikely, except in a very few cases, to ever stand [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=492.72s)]
*  trial in the United States. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=498.76s)]
*  They're not going to be going to a country where they can be extradited or even returning [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=501.40000000000003s)]
*  to the United States unless they are very foolish. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  I think we need to uncover all of the connections and make it very clear that you can vote however [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=510.24s)]
*  you want, but we are not going to let adversaries, whether it is Russia, China, Iran or anybody [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=517.44s)]
*  else basically try to influence Americans as to how we should vote in picking our leaders. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxrngjBER3E&t=524.48s)]
