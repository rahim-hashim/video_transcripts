# Illusion Of Normalcy Quickly Shattered By Sirens, Russian Bombs In Lviv
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo)
*  Here in Lviv, life feels ordinary throughout much of the day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=0.0s)]
*  This cosmopolitan city had been mostly spared from Russian attacks until Saturday, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=5.0s)]
*  when missiles came raining down in two separate strikes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=10.0s)]
*  No one was killed, but the feeling of security has been shattered for many Ukrainians, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=15.0s)]
*  including those who fled from the east, who sought refuge in Lviv, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=20.0s)]
*  which is just an hour from the Polish border. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=24.0s)]
*  There are signs of war here, but life goes on until the evening curfew. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=27.0s)]
*  This group of young people fled Kiev after airstrikes hit that city. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=32.0s)]
*  You decided to come here to escape that, and now it's happening here as well? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=37.0s)]
*  Yeah. And in this moment we're like, where can we go for a safe place? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=40.0s)]
*  And there's no safe place in Ukraine, I think, right now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=47.0s)]
*  When you hear the alarm, the sirens, do you change anything? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=50.0s)]
*  There's a siren right now. Would you keep drinking your coffee and eating your cake? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=54.0s)]
*  No, I think not. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=58.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=60.0s)]
*  You'd get up, you'd leave? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=61.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=62.0s)]
*  I'd go somewhere. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=63.0s)]
*  Then, just moments after we left them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=64.0s)]
*  Alright, what we've got is a typical day right here in the middle of Lviv. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=68.0s)]
*  The air raid sirens have just begun, they've just gone on. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=73.0s)]
*  There are usually two sets. The starting set, where they're announcing, please take shelter, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=77.0s)]
*  there is an air raid. There'll be another set in half an hour or whenever they've determined that there isn't a strike, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=81.0s)]
*  and that will be the return to your activities. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=87.0s)]
*  There's an app that everybody carries with them that goes red when there's an air raid like this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=90.0s)]
*  This siren indicates that there is an actual air raid. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=95.0s)]
*  You will see people start to disperse, they'll start to head to places that are shelters. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=99.0s)]
*  A lot of these stores around where we are right now in this cafe district have shelter in them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=104.0s)]
*  They're not real bunkers that are designed for an attack, but there are some shelter. They are in the basement. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=111.0s)]
*  What you'll also see is a lot of people who do nothing. They don't change their behavior at all. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=116.0s)]
*  They're going to stay, they're going to be walking around the streets, and basically until last weekend, that's how it went, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=121.0s)]
*  because when there was an air raid siren, it covers a very, very large area. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=127.0s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily mean there's a missile or something headed in this direction, but you can see there are people [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=132.0s)]
*  grabbing each other's hands, moving a little quickly, going into these shelters, returning home and things like that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=138.0s)]
*  But there are a lot of people who are staying outside right now, hoping it'll pass in a few minutes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=144.0s)]
*  This is still a city that is thought of by the people who are here as safe. Many of them are not from here. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=150.0s)]
*  They've come from places like Keith and from places further east where there has been actual shelling, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=156.0s)]
*  so they feel that this is actually a relatively safe place to be despite the air raid sirens. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=161.0s)]
*  But not everyone feels safe. Once the sirens began blaring, we discovered this family had scrambled for cover in this concrete shelter. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=167.0s)]
*  They're refugees from the besieged northeastern Ukraine town of Sumy near the Russian border. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=176.0s)]
*  It was a very terrible situation. It was very scary, so we had to leave our home and our region. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=183.0s)]
*  Standing in this shelter with their kids, it felt like the war was following them. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=192.0s)]
*  A few minutes ago we heard the air raid sirens. Is that why you came under here? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=198.0s)]
*  Yes, of course. We saved our lives and our children. Now we plan to stay here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=203.0s)]
*  We hope that the situation may be changed. We hope of this. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=212.0s)]
*  So I don't want to leave and go far from this city. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=220.0s)]
*  In just one afternoon, the sights and sounds of this city can be surreal, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=230.0s)]
*  but some Ukrainians here are determined to not let a war change their routine, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=240.0s)]
*  even if it's just sitting outside on a spring day with a coffee and some cake. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=245.0s)]
*  Your life is not going to change your coffee and your cake. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=250.0s)]
*  You're here with me. Yeah, I'm here with you too. But you're teaching me about what this means. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=253.0s)]
*  We will die together maybe. Let's live together. Let's live together. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=258.0s)]
*  Snapshot of life here in Lviv in the second month of Russia's invasion. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=264.0s)]
*  Life goes on while it still can. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r1g4LQWsdo&t=272.0s)]
