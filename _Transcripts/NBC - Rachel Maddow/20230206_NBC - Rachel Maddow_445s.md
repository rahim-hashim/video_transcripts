# Neo-Nazis intent on race war target U.S. infrastructure
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc)
*  In 2017, May 2017, an 18-year-old neo-Nazi in Tampa, Florida, shot and killed two of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=0.0s)]
*  his three roommates. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=8.16s)]
*  When the police searched the apartment after that double homicide, they ended up also arresting, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  in addition to the shooter, they ended up arresting a third roommate, one who was not [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=15.36s)]
*  shot. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=19.72s)]
*  Turns out that third roommate had been stockpiling a huge amount of homemade explosives in their [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=20.72s)]
*  shared garage. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=26.68s)]
*  In a separate incident a little more than a year earlier, March 2016, a 28-year-old [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=29.04s)]
*  woman was arrested for robbing four different convenience stores in Maryland while armed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  with a machete. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=39.56s)]
*  Well, now get this, it all comes together. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=40.56s)]
*  Turns out the machete wielder and the explosives hoarder then began a relationship while they [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=44.04s)]
*  were each serving time in separate prisons. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=50.16s)]
*  Aww. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=53.08s)]
*  Now, today, those two individuals were arrested again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=54.08s)]
*  Several prosecutors allege that the two plotted to attack five electrical power substations [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=57.76s)]
*  around Baltimore, Maryland. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=62.68s)]
*  Their plan was allegedly to knock out a ring of five specific electrical substations all [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=64.24s)]
*  in one day because they thought that would cause a cascading effect to, quote, completely [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=69.64s)]
*  destroy the whole city, meaning presumably they expected to knock Baltimore into a pre-electric [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=74.36s)]
*  light state of being and one that couldn't easily be repaired. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=80.64s)]
*  Now if that whole plan, if that whole idea to shoot up electrical substations to knock [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=85.16s)]
*  out the power semi-permanently and cause major chaos, if that plan is giving you déjà vu, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=90.44s)]
*  you are not mistaken. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  There have been at least nine attacks on electric power substations, at least nine attacks across [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  three different states, just in the past three months. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=103.32s)]
*  Early last year, Homeland Security issued a bulletin warning that domestic violent extremists [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=107.4s)]
*  have, quote, developed credible specific plans to attack electricity infrastructure since [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=113.2s)]
*  at least 2020. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=118.32s)]
*  Now, in most of these attacks, suspects haven't been identified, and that means motives can't [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=120.32s)]
*  be identified either. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=125.74s)]
*  But last month, NPR affiliates in Oregon and Washington obtained an FBI memo showing that [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  neo-Nazi groups were calling for attacks just like this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=132.92s)]
*  The neo-Nazis that the FBI was tracking, quote, believe that an attack on electrical infrastructure [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=137.72s)]
*  will contribute to their ideological goal of causing societal collapse and a subsequent [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=142.72s)]
*  race war in the United States. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=147.88s)]
*  And that's part of what makes these arrests about this planned Baltimore attack today [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=151.32s)]
*  significant because the former explosives hoarder arrested today, he's the founder of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  a neo-Nazi group called the Atomwaffen, and the former machete-wielding robber who was [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=161.77999999999997s)]
*  also arrested today. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=168.4s)]
*  She wrote what the FBI believed to be a ideological manifesto of sorts, which both references [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=169.72000000000003s)]
*  hitting electrical substations to knock out power and also her admiration for the Unabomber [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=176.68s)]
*  and for Hitler. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=182.12s)]
*  Joining us now is Kathleen Ballew. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=184.68s)]
*  She teaches history at Northwestern University. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  She's the author of Bring the War Home, the White Power Movement and Paramilitary America, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=188.44000000000003s)]
*  which is really the seminal text in this field. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=193.12s)]
*  Professor Ballew, I really appreciate you being here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=195.56s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=197.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  So I said at the top of the show tonight that this appears to be emerging as a favored tactic [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  of the White Power Movement and the sort of neo-Nazi affiliated white supremacist movement [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=207.28s)]
*  in the United States. Is that a fair generalization? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=212.12s)]
*  Yes, although the electrical part may be new, but infrastructure attacks by this movement [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=216.36s)]
*  are not new. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=221.88000000000002s)]
*  This is a strategy that was pioneered by a group called the Order in 1983 moving forward. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=223.28s)]
*  And that group is sort of the base of oper- well, the tactical base for Atomwaffen Division, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=229.68s)]
*  which translates to the base. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  So infrastructure attacks are one kind of violence among several others that are all [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=238.0s)]
*  laid out in a strategy in common in order to bring about what the movement seeks, which is [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  the overthrow of the United States, creation of a white ethno-state, mass violence against [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=251.52s)]
*  communities of color, and even genocide against non-white peoples. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  So infrastructure attacks sit next to a show of force violence, like the January 6th attack [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=261.04s)]
*  on the Capitol, and mass casualty violence, like the Oklahoma City bombing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=267.68s)]
*  All of these exist together within one broad ideology in the White Power Movement. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=272.32s)]
*  I've heard this described as accelerationist tactics, and I know that's an awkward word. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=278.23999999999995s)]
*  But I wonder if you can sort of explain the thinking there, because I feel like there's a [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=284.96s)]
*  little bit of a leap of logic to it, which makes it not translate to non-expert news consumers [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  about this. I mean, the idea is that you'd attack infrastructure, you'd cause people material pain, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  you'd cause chaos and upset, and then somehow there's a slippery slope that results in race, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=300.96s)]
*  war and white people taking over, and genocide against non-white people. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=306.64s)]
*  Like, why do they believe that infrastructure attacks and resulting chaos ultimately accelerate [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=310.08s)]
*  us to some race, war future where they think they're going to win? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  So infrastructure attacks and mass casualty violence and show of power attacks are all [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=321.36s)]
*  meant to do the same thing in the ideology of this movement, which is laid out in books like [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=327.68s)]
*  the Turner Diaries and in movement ideological writings of other kinds. They are all supposed [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=331.84s)]
*  to awaken other people to what these activists see as the staggering state of emergency problems [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=338.56s)]
*  that face white people. The woman arrested today in that piece of writing apparently said or said [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=347.12s)]
*  to an informant that she would do anything for my people. This is the idea of white people as her [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=353.44s)]
*  race and as her nation. It reflects a sense that white people are being extinguished and will be [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=359.68s)]
*  apocalyptically vanished if action is not taken. So infrastructure attacks, like taking out the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=366.16s)]
*  power supply in Baltimore, taking out heat, taking out the ability of hospitals to perform [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=372.08s)]
*  their operations, right? If you don't have hospital electricity, you can't run the basics of any of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=377.12s)]
*  our systems. These are meant to make other white people awaken to these injustices as perceived by [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=383.28s)]
*  these activists so that everyone will rise up a little bit at a time against the broader, what [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=391.28s)]
*  they would call the system, which is the United States government. Absolute insanity and holding [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  force on a significant sliver of the white power movement you're describing, as you said, for at [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=404.0s)]
*  least the last 40 years. Kathleen Ballew, associate professor of history at Northwestern, author of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=409.6s)]
*  the seminal text Bring the War Home, the White Power Movement in Paramilitary America. Professor [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=416.32000000000005s)]
*  Ballew, thank you so much for your time tonight. Thanks for having me. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=421.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpu2AcZDBNc&t=439.6s)]
