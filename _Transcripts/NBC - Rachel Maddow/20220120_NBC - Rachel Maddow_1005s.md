# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 19
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE)
*  Joining us now is Suzanne Craig, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=0.0s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter for The Times. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=1.44s)]
*  Suzanne, thank you for being with us on this story. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=3.6s)]
*  I appreciate your time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=5.72s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Did you learn anything in these filings [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=9.84s)]
*  that you did not know or that you didn't anticipate [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=11.88s)]
*  from what you and your colleagues [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=14.72s)]
*  already turned up at The Times? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=15.98s)]
*  Well, I was intrigued by one of the legal arguments [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=19.16s)]
*  that surfaced in the documents, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=23.36s)]
*  which is these cases are difficult [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=25.88s)]
*  because people like Donald Trump and others often say [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=28.46s)]
*  when they're in this situation, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=31.54s)]
*  I rely on the advice of experts. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=32.82s)]
*  I hire accountants, I hire lawyers, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=36.42s)]
*  and I rely on their advice. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=38.46s)]
*  And often that can help them navigate [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=40.38s)]
*  or is it just a good shield against these sort of charges. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=42.82s)]
*  And last night we saw, I think, an avenue [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=46.68s)]
*  that the attorney general is gonna be going down is, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=48.86s)]
*  which as she said, and I'll just read from it, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=51.38s)]
*  she said that they misstated the purported involvement [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=54.1s)]
*  outside professionals in reaching valuations. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=56.779999999999994s)]
*  What she's saying there is they were much more involved [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=59.699999999999996s)]
*  in setting these valuations than we may have thought. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=62.86s)]
*  And I think she's gonna go use that to say [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=67.5s)]
*  that they have some liability potentially here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=70.22s)]
*  And that it wasn't that, oh, they were just [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=72.9s)]
*  phoning the lawyers and the accountants. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=74.7s)]
*  They certainly had those, but they were very, very involved [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=76.17999999999999s)]
*  in some of the valuations that ended up in banks [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=79.06s)]
*  and insurance companies and elsewhere [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=83.46s)]
*  that could get them in hot water. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=85.16s)]
*  That's interesting because it occurred to me [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=87.52s)]
*  that making those misrepresentations to a bank [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=89.36s)]
*  or insurance company would have itself been a problem [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=92.28s)]
*  in terms of your duty to be honest [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=96.08s)]
*  to those types of institutions [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=98.32s)]
*  when you're trying to get money out of them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=99.56s)]
*  But it would also, as you say, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=101.02s)]
*  undercut any claim they could have made [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=102.86s)]
*  that they were counting on professional advice [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=104.72s)]
*  in order to come up with these numbers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=107.66s)]
*  We don't know right now, both could be true. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=109.64s)]
*  It depends on the evidence that's brought forward [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=112.75999999999999s)]
*  and it's one thing for Donald Trump to sign off [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=114.97999999999999s)]
*  on a document and to say, okay, on a post-it note [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=116.82s)]
*  that this is great. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=119.46s)]
*  And it's another thing for them [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=120.74s)]
*  to have been heavily involved, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=122.3s)]
*  but it seems like they're building towards a case [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  that would say that they were heavily involved [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=126.17999999999999s)]
*  and were sort of the direct link to Donald Trump's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=128.54s)]
*  forwarding information to a bank or Allen Weisselberg, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=132.22s)]
*  former CFO who was CFO for decades. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=136.88s)]
*  They were deeply involved in discussions on this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=139.82s)]
*  and in the contact with these financial institutions. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=142.86s)]
*  And that's the contact that could get them in trouble [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=146.58s)]
*  is potentially filing false information [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=148.78s)]
*  to financial institutions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=151.5s)]
*  In terms of the documents and like you mentioned, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=153.82000000000002s)]
*  post-it notes, one of the things that surprised me [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=156.3s)]
*  is that there's this reference to a filing cabinet. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  We know that Trump famously doesn't use a computer, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=162.66000000000003s)]
*  doesn't use email, doesn't put his thoughts [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=165.62s)]
*  in a replicable format like that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=169.10000000000002s)]
*  in a way that investigators would I'm sure like to see, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  but there's some sort of filing cabinet [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=173.62s)]
*  with his papers and correspondence [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=175.66000000000003s)]
*  that the attorney general appears to know about. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  Does that strike you as important? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=179.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not a lawyer, but I would think [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=182.22000000000003s)]
*  that would be one of the first things [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=184.22000000000003s)]
*  that I would wanna look at if I was an investigator. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=185.38000000000002s)]
*  And apparently there is a filing cabinet [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=187.58s)]
*  that everything's chronological [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=189.9s)]
*  and they've kept all of Mr. Trump's post-it notes [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=192.34s)]
*  and handwritten notes for years, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=197.62s)]
*  correspondence to employees. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=200.66s)]
*  We don't know what's in there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=202.66s)]
*  I'll volunteer if they need a middleman to go look, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  but wow, I'd really like to see that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=206.82s)]
*  And that could go to what we're talking about. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=210.06s)]
*  Millions of documents have been turned over already [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  according to the filings, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=216.18s)]
*  but this filing cabinet still is one of the things [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=217.62s)]
*  that there's still a lot of tension over [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=220.78s)]
*  and they haven't seen it yet. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=223.54s)]
*  There's other documents as well, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=224.98s)]
*  but this one in particular was just like, okay, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  I'd love to see it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=230.06s)]
*  I'm sure the investigators would. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=230.9s)]
*  I was just looking back today [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=233.58s)]
*  at when Republicans were in the majority in the Senate [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=236.74s)]
*  and President Trump was in office. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=239.5s)]
*  During that time, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=242.34s)]
*  McCreplican Senate leader Mitch McConnell [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=244.38s)]
*  is running the Senate, Trump is in the White House. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=245.98000000000002s)]
*  During that time, Mitch McConnell [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=248.14000000000001s)]
*  and the Senate Republicans went nuclear [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=250.22s)]
*  and decided it would be a majority vote only, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=253.34s)]
*  it would be 50 votes only [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=255.98000000000002s)]
*  to confirm Supreme Court nominees. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=257.58s)]
*  Then Mitch McConnell went nuclear another time [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=260.58s)]
*  and decided it would be a majority vote only, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=263.38s)]
*  it would be 50 votes only needed [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=265.74s)]
*  for lower level executive branch nominees. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=267.94s)]
*  Then he went nuclear a third time [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=270.9s)]
*  and decided he would change the filibuster rule [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=272.97999999999996s)]
*  and it would only have to be a majority vote, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=275.34s)]
*  a 50 vote threshold for federal district court judges. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=277.38s)]
*  Even since President Biden has been president, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  the United States Senate has decided to go nuclear, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=283.5s)]
*  as they say, to require just a majority vote, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=286.3s)]
*  just 50 votes on a bill to fund the government last year. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=288.86s)]
*  They also did it, they went nuclear, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=293.26s)]
*  they decided it would be just a majority vote, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=294.94s)]
*  just 50 votes for a random vote [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=296.7s)]
*  that didn't go anywhere about vaccine requirements. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=299.5s)]
*  I mean, we use the phrase go nuclear [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=302.42s)]
*  because it's supposed to be the end of the world, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=304.3s)]
*  It's supposed to be mutually assured destruction. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=306.06s)]
*  Turns out they go nuclear all the time. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=308.58000000000004s)]
*  They go nuclear and decide that a 50 vote majority is enough [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=311.22s)]
*  that we can't have a 60 vote threshold [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=316.78000000000003s)]
*  for a particular type of action in the Senate [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=318.58s)]
*  or a particular type of legislation [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=320.58s)]
*  or a particular amendment, a particular vote. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=322.02000000000004s)]
*  They do that all the time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=324.26s)]
*  Now, even in this Senate, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  even when the Republicans were in control [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=327.62s)]
*  with Trump in the White House, it happens all the time. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=330.26s)]

*  which is wild and flagrant [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=493.86s)]
*  and almost impressively dishonest. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=496.54s)]

*  That means if she finds illegal activity, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=562.86s)]
*  she can bring a lawsuit against the Trump organization, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=565.74s)]

*  if you will. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=599.7s)]
*  The reason we got this filing late last night [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=600.62s)]

*  How'd they get to 291? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=716.02s)]
*  They asked Eric, and Eric said it was definitely [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=717.5s)]
*  worth $291 million, and that, you know, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=720.38s)]
*  how can you argue with that? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=722.98s)]
*  Seems legit. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=723.86s)]
*  The New York Attorney General's Office writes, quote, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=726.14s)]
*  asked to explain various aspects of the 2012 [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=728.06s)]
*  and 2013 valuations, Eric Trump repeatedly invoked [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=731.14s)]
*  his Fifth Amendment privilege. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=734.22s)]
*  In fact, according to the Attorney General, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=736.9s)]
*  Eric Trump pled the Fifth more than 500 times [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=738.38s)]
*  during his testimony to the Attorney General's office. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=742.86s)]
*  And crucially, the Attorney General alleges [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=746.54s)]
*  that all of this asset inflation was not just [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=748.46s)]
*  like bragging rights and puffery and hand-sized stuff. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=750.78s)]
*  She says the Trump Organization in some cases [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=755.22s)]
*  was using this kind of information to actively lie [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=757.54s)]
*  to banks or insurance companies about, like, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=761.14s)]
*  where these valuations were coming from, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=764.98s)]
*  for the purpose of doing business with those banks [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=766.9s)]
*  and insurance companies. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=768.74s)]
*  Quote, representations to an insurance company [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=770.3000000000001s)]
*  were not just about the fact that the valuations [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=772.9399999999999s)]
*  listed in Trump's personal financial statements [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=774.74s)]
*  were prepared annually by professional appraisal firms. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=776.5s)]
*  Those representations were false. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=780.62s)]
*  The valuations were prepared, in fact, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=782.9399999999999s)]
*  by Trump Organization staff, contrary to what [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=785.02s)]
*  the insurance company was expressly told and believed. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=787.86s)]
*  So it's one thing to make up fantastical valuations [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=792.62s)]
*  for your properties. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=796.9399999999999s)]
*  It's another thing to go to an insurance company [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=798.26s)]
*  and make up those valuations for that insurance company [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=800.54s)]
*  on the basis of those fantastical assertions [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=801.78s)]
*  of the value of these properties. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=804.7s)]
*  And then to tell those insurance companies, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=806.58s)]
*  and, you know, by the way, that appraisal came [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=808.26s)]
*  from the pros, that's a professionally done thing, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=810.3s)]
*  when in fact it was not, when in fact it was like, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=812.7s)]
*  a call to Eric or somebody else working [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=814.5s)]
*  in the Trump Organization apparently making these things up. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=816.86s)]
*  Tis James also alleges that Donald Trump [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=820.78s)]
*  and his company may have lied to the IRS. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=822.54s)]
*  He got tax deductions worth millions of dollars [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=825.54s)]
*  on the Seven Springs estate. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=827.7s)]
*  Those deductions appear to have been based [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=829.3s)]
*  on a wildly inflated valuation based in part [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=830.9799999999999s)]
*  on what the Trump Organization asserted [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=834.26s)]
*  were seven mansions on the property, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=836.3s)]
*  but those are mansions that did not exist. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=838.38s)]
*  And that's just one example, that's just one Trump property. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=842.66s)]
*  That's all the Seven Springs place in Westchester. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=845.9799999999999s)]
*  The Attorney General has filed over 150 pages [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=848.5799999999999s)]
*  with the court as of last night, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=851.3s)]

*  other stories like this one. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=854.9399999999999s)]
*  Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas at one point [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=857.34s)]
*  tried to say that Democrats were hypocrites [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=860.5s)]
*  because he read a letter from 2017 [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=863.7s)]
*  in which several Democratic senators said they supported [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=866.34s)]
*  keeping the filibuster as it is. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=869.1s)]
*  One of the senators who signed that letter [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=872.6600000000001s)]
*  is New Hampshire Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=874.3000000000001s)]
*  who has talked here on the show a couple of times, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=876.74s)]
*  including last night, about how her position [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=879.14s)]
*  on the filibuster has evolved and why. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=880.86s)]
*  After Senator Cotton invoked her [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=884.42s)]
*  and the other Democratic senators who signed that letter, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=887.38s)]
*  Senator Hassan actually got up for an impromptu response. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=890.22s)]
*  This was really interesting, watch. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=893.54s)]
*  I know I was not scheduled to speak, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=896.74s)]
*  but I do wanna respond as one of the signatories [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=899.5799999999999s)]
*  of the letter. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=901.98s)]
*  I associate myself with everything [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=903.02s)]
*  that the other signatories have talked about [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=905.1s)]
*  in terms of wanting to restore the Senate's tradition [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=907.54s)]
*  of extended debate on issues of grave importance [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=911.18s)]
*  to the American people. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=914.66s)]
*  But let me be clear about the reason [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=916.26s)]
*  that I now support an adjustment [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=919.8599999999999s)]
*  to the longstanding rules of the Senate. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=924.7399999999999s)]
*  And it is because I never imagined when I signed that letter [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=928.06s)]
*  that not a single member of the Republican Party [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=931.9799999999999s)]
*  would stand up for our democracy [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=936.3399999999999s)]
*  since January 6th, when we saw an acceleration [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=939.9s)]
*  of state laws that would allow partisans [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=943.9s)]
*  to overturn the impartial count of an election. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=946.14s)]
*  But if we do not have a functioning democracy [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=951.14s)]
*  where people know that when they vote, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=955.5799999999999s)]
*  that vote will be impartially counted and upheld, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=958.34s)]
*  and the people who are defeated will accept defeat [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=962.18s)]
*  so that they can have an accountable elected representation [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=965.42s)]
*  in Washington, then there is no democracy. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=969.8199999999999s)]
*  And when I signed that letter, I never imagined [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=974.3s)]
*  that today's Republican Party [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=978.86s)]
*  would fail to stand up for democracy. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnX_b5Q3bTE&t=982.1s)]
