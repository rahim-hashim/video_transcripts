# What We Learned About Trump's Fake Elector Scheme At The Fourth January 6 Hearing
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo)
*  But the final point that we're going to recap now was sort of mind-blowing to me, a mind-blowing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=0.0s)]
*  amount of new information on the issue of fake electors. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=7.36s)]
*  The hearing today revealed a lot of new information on the part of the plot where Trump tried [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=12.16s)]
*  to make Republican officials and states he lost, nevertheless send in electors to the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=18.46s)]
*  Electoral College for him as if he had won. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  I'll just nut up what I saw at least as the new information that we learned today from [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=25.28s)]
*  the hearing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=29.52s)]
*  First, we saw that from the hearing today that the White House Counsel's Office said [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=30.52s)]
*  explicitly told people, including Trump's White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=35.12s)]
*  and his top lawyer Rudy Giuliani, White House Counsel's Office, explicitly told them that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=39.24s)]
*  their fake elector scheme was not legal. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=43.44s)]
*  Also, we learned that the Trump campaign lawyers all bailed on the scheme, made sure they themselves [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=47.16s)]
*  had nothing to do with it because they too believed it was illegal. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=53.44s)]
*  We also learned that the Trump campaign lawyers apparently did not convey this fact down the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=57.62s)]
*  line. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=62.18s)]
*  And so Republicans who took part in the scheme at the state level, at least some of them, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=63.18s)]
*  felt duped into doing it and now say, now that they realize Trump's lawyers knew it [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=67.58s)]
*  was illegal, boy, they wish they hadn't taken part. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=71.84s)]
*  The committee also turned up evidence that some of the fake electors asked the Trump [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=75.5s)]
*  campaign to please cover their legal costs in case they were sued or arrested and charged [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=79.38s)]
*  with a crime for having participated in the scheme. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=85.76s)]
*  We also learned today that the National Republican Party, the RNC, helped with this part of the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=89.04s)]
*  scheme. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=94.12s)]
*  The Republican Party chair, Ronna Romney McDaniel, testified that the Republican Party helped [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=95.12s)]
*  put the fake slates of electors together. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  They helped the Trump campaign in this illegal effort. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=103.48s)]
*  Bizarrely, we also learned that the fake electors in Michigan had a plan to hide out overnight [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=107.28s)]
*  inside the Michigan state capitol so they'd be there in the morning and able to sign their [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=115.68s)]
*  forged certificates inside the state capitol, even if nobody wanted to let them in. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=121.04s)]
*  Even more bizarrely, we learned that the Trump campaign had trouble physically getting the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=126.12s)]
*  forged elector certificates to Washington in time for the fake certificates to potentially [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=131.24s)]
*  be used on January 6th. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=137.16s)]
*  Nevertheless, apparently, or maybe because they were having trouble with it, I don't [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=141.64s)]
*  know, apparently Republican U.S. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin offered that he would [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  hand courier the fake certificates to Vice President Pence on January 6th itself. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=152.11999999999998s)]
*  Seriously, that was all today. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=159.11999999999998s)]
*  The fake electors scheme was always bizarre and astonishing from the first moment we found [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=161.48s)]
*  out about it, but today, honestly, it just went bananas. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2AIwSI_4Zo&t=166.82s)]
