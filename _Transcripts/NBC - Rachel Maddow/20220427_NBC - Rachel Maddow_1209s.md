# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 26
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8)
*  I'm going to show you a video here that is a little bit hard to watch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=0.0s)]
*  So if you are not inclined to see something like that or if you're watching with kids, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=3.9s)]
*  this is your fair warning if you want to just look away for a minute. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=8.8s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=12.52s)]
*  This is a security video from the San Fernando Courthouse in Los Angeles County. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=13.52s)]
*  This video was obtained by the LA Times and it shows a prisoner, a man in handcuffs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=19.1s)]
*  You see in the blue trousers there on the white colored shirt. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=23.92s)]
*  His name is Enzo Escalante. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=26.96s)]
*  It starts with him punching an LA County Sheriff's deputy and then you see him get wrestled to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=29.38s)]
*  the ground. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=32.66s)]
*  Then though, one of the deputies that wrestled him to the ground puts his knee on the prisoner's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=34.86s)]
*  head and continues to kneel on his head for three solid minutes, which left that man on [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=39.98s)]
*  the ground alive, thankfully, but pretty well beat up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=48.5s)]
*  And if there's elements of that video that feel familiar to you, it's important to note [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=52.9s)]
*  the timing here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=55.82s)]
*  That incident took place last year on March 10th, March 10th, 2021, which happens to have [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=57.14s)]
*  been two days after a jury selection had started in the very highly publicized trial of Derek [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=63.82s)]
*  Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murdering George Floyd, specifically [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=69.94s)]
*  by kneeling for minutes on end on the neck of George Floyd. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=75.38s)]
*  Well, it was a reporter at the LA Times named Aileen Chakmedian who published this video [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=80.86s)]
*  last month, along with reporting alleging that the LA County Sheriff's Department, up [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=87.17999999999999s)]
*  to and including the sheriff himself, had attempted to cover up the incident because [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=91.69999999999999s)]
*  they feared the negative light this incident could shed on the department. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=95.82s)]
*  The sheriff himself has maintained that he didn't know about this until months after [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=100.58s)]
*  it happened. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=104.34s)]
*  He says he didn't cover anything up. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=105.34s)]
*  He says he relieved the deputy of duty immediately after he became aware of what had happened. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=106.66s)]
*  Well, yesterday that same LA Times reporter, Aileen Chakmedian, added to the story, reporting [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=112.58s)]
*  that an LA County Sheriff's Department commander had filed a new legal claim, contesting all [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  of those denials from the sheriff, alleging specifically that the sheriff had viewed a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=125.69999999999999s)]
*  video of the incident just five days after it occurred, not eight months later, which [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=129.82s)]
*  is what he claimed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=134.5s)]
*  The commander further alleges that Sheriff Villanueva said to the group he watched the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=136.22s)]
*  video with, quote, We do not need bad media at this time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=140.26s)]
*  So the LA Times publishes the disturbing video. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=145.82s)]
*  The sheriff says, I had no idea. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=149.22s)]
*  We didn't cover that up. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=151.26s)]
*  As soon as I found out about it, I took action. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=152.26s)]
*  A commander on his own force says that is not true. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=154.22s)]
*  You absolutely knew about it and you did cover it up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=157.02s)]
*  That's where the story stood as of yesterday. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=160.5s)]
*  Where it went today is absolutely bananas because today LA County Sheriff Villanueva [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=162.26s)]
*  convened a press conference to dispute all of this reporting. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=169.02s)]
*  And what he did at this press conference that is now causing a fresh round of headlines [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=173.70000000000002s)]
*  is that he got up at this press conference today in person and he put up a big poster [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=177.66s)]
*  for everyone to see. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=182.54s)]
*  Poster had three large photos on it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=184.58s)]
*  One on the right is the LA Times journalist who did this reporting. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=187.1s)]
*  Also, another photo is one of his political rivals for the elected position of LA County [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=191.5s)]
*  Sheriff and the third photo was the LA Sheriff Department Inspector General who investigates [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=196.58s)]
*  things like this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=202.46s)]
*  The reason he put up the photo of those three is because the sheriff announced today that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=203.9s)]
*  all three of them are now subjects of a criminal investigation. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  And to how the LA Times reporter, Aline Chakmedian, got that security footage. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=213.3s)]
*  They're all the subjects of a criminal investigation now by his office. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=217.86s)]
*  He says they're all being investigated now for possible felonies like conspiracy and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=221.4s)]
*  burglary and unauthorized use of a database. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=226.1s)]
*  He put up all this list of potential crimes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=229.42s)]
*  All while the LA Times reporter, Aline Chakmedian, was in the front row covering the press conference [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=233.66s)]
*  for this paper while the sheriff puts up her picture as a possible perpetrator who his [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=237.84s)]
*  office is going after. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=243.18s)]
*  This decision by the sheriff today to announce a criminal investigation into this reporter [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=246.62s)]
*  certainly looks like retaliation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=251.7s)]
*  The executive editor of the LA Times put out this statement tonight, citing the sheriff's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=253.94s)]
*  attempt to criminalize news reporting, saying it goes against well-established constitutional [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=258.38s)]
*  law, quote, we will vigorously defend Chakmedian's and the LA Times' rights in any proceeding [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=263.38s)]
*  or investigation brought by authorities. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=268.98s)]
*  This story started off bad in Los Angeles. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=272.38s)]
*  Today it took a very, very dark turn. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=275.38s)]
*  Today was another day when we learned how close to toast our own democracy has been, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=279.06s)]
*  thanks to efforts on the right to try to use force to overwhelm our democratic process [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=285.02s)]
*  in this past year. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=289.97999999999996s)]
*  In recent days, we learned that Republican Utah Senator Mike Lee participated avidly [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=292.26s)]
*  in the illegal scheme to try to get states that were won by Joe Biden to nevertheless [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=296.85999999999996s)]
*  send fake electors to Congress so that states' votes would be counted for Trump instead of [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=301.67999999999995s)]
*  Biden and the Electoral College. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=305.94s)]
*  Senator Mike Lee had previously denied participating in any such scheme. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=308.18s)]
*  He said he was shocked, shocked when he heard about it, thought it was crazy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=311.74s)]
*  But we now know he was promoting it aggressively to the White House, and he himself was personally [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=315.66s)]
*  trying to help pull it off by personally contacting officials in multiple states that had been [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=320.54s)]
*  won by Biden to see if there was any way to get their votes counted as if they had been [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=325.74s)]
*  cast for Trump instead. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=329.9s)]
*  We have learned as well, hot on the heels of those revelations, that the White House [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=333.62s)]
*  Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, was advised directly by the White House Counsel's Office [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=337.36s)]
*  that that scheme was illegal. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=342.36s)]
*  That scheme involving states won by Biden, nevertheless trying to have their votes counted [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=345.64s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=349.6s)]
*  He was told in no uncertain terms that was illegal. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=351.36s)]
*  He was reportedly told that multiple times by the White House Counsel's Office. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=354.28s)]
*  And even though he was informed by the White House Counsel's Office that such a scheme [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=357.88s)]
*  was illegal, he pursued it anyway. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=360.96s)]
*  And we have since learned he wasn't alone. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=363.6s)]
*  Mark Meadows' aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, has testified to the January 6th investigation [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=366.6s)]
*  that three Republican members of Congress were present. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=370.84s)]
*  Republican Congressman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=374.76s)]
*  and Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert of Texas. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=379.64s)]
*  Perry, Gaetz, and Gohmert were all present when White House lawyers told Meadows and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=382.6s)]
*  them that this scheme involving the states that Biden won, that scheme was illegal. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=388.52s)]
*  Mr. Meadows nevertheless kept trying for it, even after they had all been told it was [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=393.96s)]
*  against the law. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=398.0s)]
*  CNN reports today that one of those members, Scott Perry, texted White House Chief of Staff, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=401.52s)]
*  Mark Meadows, just a few days after the election, that the White House needed to have the NSA, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=405.88s)]
*  the National Security Administration, immediately seize communications related to voting machines. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=411.12s)]
*  He that same day texted the White House that the CIA was in on some sort of anti-Trump plot [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=416.56s)]
*  and the White House needed to act against the CIA as well. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=422.36s)]
*  Tonight, New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns have released more [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=427.52s)]
*  audio from the immediate aftermath of the January 6th attack. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=431.52s)]
*  Their forthcoming book, which is released on Tuesday of next week, is apparently going [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=435.24s)]
*  to be accompanied by an absolute trove of incredibly disturbing audio tapes, audio recordings [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  of Republicans speaking among themselves in the immediate aftermath of the January 6th attack, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=447.16s)]
*  including this newly released discussion of how dangerous top Republicans believed it was [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  for pro-Trump Republican members of Congress to keep talking in violent terms, to violent [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=459.08000000000004s)]
*  and incendiary terms, about even other members of Congress the way they were in the wake [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  of the January 6th attack. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=469.64000000000004s)]
*  I think Moe and Louis' comments too, a lot of members have said some real concerning [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=477.16s)]
*  things about... [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=504.68s)]
*  Did they say something to they too? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=505.68s)]
*  No, I said Louis was at... [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=507.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean Moe was at the rally, you know, the we're kicking a **** and taking names thing [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=509.32s)]
*  at the Trump rally. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=514.48s)]
*  These are things before they kicked that out. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=515.48s)]
*  What did Gates say? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=516.48s)]
*  Gates said... [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=517.48s)]
*  Gates brought up Liz specifically. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=518.48s)]
*  I just saw that on Twitter. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=519.48s)]
*  Adam, someone just sent it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=520.48s)]
*  Gonzalez just sent it to me. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=521.48s)]
*  So I'm calling Gates. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=522.48s)]
*  I'm explaining to him. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=523.48s)]
*  I don't know how to understand it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=524.48s)]
*  I'm going to have some trouble. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=525.48s)]
*  I'm going to have to get it out of my head. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=526.48s)]
*  I'm going to have to get it out of my head. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=527.48s)]
*  I'm going to have to get it out of my head. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=528.48s)]
*  I'm going to have to get it out of my head. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=529.48s)]
*  I'm going to have to get it out of my head. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=530.48s)]
*  I'm explaining to him. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=532.48s)]
*  I don't know how to understand it. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=533.48s)]
*  I'm going to have some other people call him too. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=534.48s)]
*  But the nature of what... [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=535.48s)]
*  If I'm getting briefing, I'm going to get another one from the FBI tomorrow. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=536.48s)]
*  This is serious ****. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=537.48s)]
*  Cut this out. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=538.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's... [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=539.48s)]
*  I mean, it's potentially illegal. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=540.48s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=541.48s)]
*  Well, he's putting people in jeopardy. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=542.48s)]
*  And he doesn't need to be doing this. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=543.48s)]
*  We saw what people would do in the Capitol. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=544.48s)]
*  You know, they're not going to be doing this. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=545.48s)]
*  They're going to be doing this. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=546.48s)]
*  They're going to be doing this. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=547.48s)]
*  They're going to be doing this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=548.48s)]
*  They're going to be doing this. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=549.48s)]
*  They're going to be doing this. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=550.48s)]
*  They're going to be doing this. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=551.48s)]
*  They're going to be doing this. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=552.48s)]
*  We saw what people would do in the Capitol. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=553.48s)]
*  They came prepared with rope, with everything else. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=569.72s)]
*  Just before that, we heard Louisiana Republican Congressman Steve Scalise saying about Matt [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=573.88s)]
*  Gates, yeah, that's potentially illegal what he's doing. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=578.8000000000001s)]
*  McCarthy said, well, he's putting people in jeopardy. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=583.24s)]
*  He doesn't need to be doing this. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=585.4s)]
*  We saw what people would do in the Capitol. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=586.5999999999999s)]
*  People came prepared with rope, with everything else. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=588.4399999999999s)]
*  That audio just released tonight by the New York Times. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=593.52s)]
*  That's the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives talking about their own [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=595.88s)]
*  members, how their incendiary calls to violence even against other members of Congress were [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=600.04s)]
*  potentially illegal, very concerning, threatening to the point of Mr. McCarthy referencing the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=605.16s)]
*  FBI briefings that he was getting in that same discussion. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=612.36s)]
*  In addition to that recording tonight released by the New York Times, we've also now got [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  the context for what Nicholas Burns and Jonathan Martin had reported here on this show last [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=622.0400000000001s)]
*  week when they described Kevin McCarthy expressing exasperation that social media companies, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=627.24s)]
*  that Twitter, wasn't cutting off the accounts of more Republicans beyond just Trump. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=634.36s)]
*  Has Republicans continued to use social media platforms like Twitter to call for violence [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=640.4s)]
*  or to otherwise say things online that could incite it? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=645.04s)]
*  Here's that tape. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=648.4s)]
*  We said like we needed to fight or something, right? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=670.4s)]
*  Didn't he say something a couple days out that was horrendous? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=673.64s)]
*  It was something like that, yes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=676.36s)]
*  It was incendiary. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=678.36s)]
*  I mean, you got the Maxine waters and all that stuff too, so I mean, I know the DIMS [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=686.36s)]
*  are in a very strong position right now to drive a lot of things, but our members have [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=694.36s)]
*  got to start paying attention to what they say to you and you can't put up with that [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=698.2s)]
*  type of s***. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=701.2s)]
*  Brooks apparently said today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=703.2s)]
*  s***, which I would say is even a step further than rhetorical take, you know. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=710.2s)]
*  If you think the president deserves to be impeached for his comments, that's almost [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=716.2s)]
*  like he goes crazy. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=721.2s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy, but... [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=722.2s)]
*  All right, let's see. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=725.2s)]
*  Will someone give me the info on what they said? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=728.2s)]
*  Have either of them apologized for what they've done? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=733.2s)]
*  I have not seen that anywhere. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=737.2s)]
*  And there's an issue with Alabama. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=741.2s)]
*  Barry Moore has said some things today even that we should look at, honestly. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=745.2s)]
*  What did Barry say today? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=750.2s)]
*  All right, so he deleted his personal Twitter account, but Jamie Dupree with the Atlanta [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=754.2s)]
*  Journal got screen shot. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=759.2s)]
*  He said about 22 hours ago, while we have more arrests for stealing a podium on January [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=762.2s)]
*  6th than we do for stealing an election on November 3rd, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Detroit [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=769.2s)]
*  would be places I recommend you start. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=773.2s)]
*  There's video evidence of these crimes as well. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=775.2s)]
*  Hashtag election integrity matters. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=778.2s)]
*  And then, um, Moore also made this tweet on Saturday night as the U.S. Capitol police [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=781.2s)]
*  officer who shot and killed a woman as he tried to get into the lobby. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=789.2s)]
*  So he tweeted at Marjorie Green and at Ney Raul. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=793.2s)]
*  I understand it was a black police officer that shot the white female veteran. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=795.2s)]
*  You know, that doesn't fit the narrative. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=800.2s)]
*  What? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=803.2s)]
*  Oh. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=805.2s)]
*  Man. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=806.2s)]
*  This isn't what we have to confront with this. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=807.2s)]
*  Can't they take their Twitter accounts away too? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=812.2s)]
*  Can't they take their Twitter accounts away too? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=816.2s)]
*  It was a black police officer who shot the white female, says Congressman Barry Moore. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=820.2s)]
*  A gasp then follows on the call and then you hear Kevin McCarthy say, can't they take their [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=827.2s)]
*  Twitter accounts away too? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=832.2s)]
*  You heard earlier in that tape of that conversation, this is a tape that reportedly was made on [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=834.2s)]
*  January 10th, so four days after the attack on the Capitol, Kevin McCarthy appearing to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=839.2s)]
*  say about Congressman Mo Brooks, you think the president deserves to be impeached for [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=844.2s)]
*  his comments ahead of the attack on the Capitol, January 6th, then describing what Congressman [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=851.2s)]
*  Mo Brooks had said at the same rally where the president spoke before the attack. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=857.2s)]
*  He said, quote, that's something that goes further than what the president says. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=861.2s)]
*  So they're talking about Mo Brooks being even more culpable than President Trump and [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=865.2s)]
*  President Trump deserving impeachment for what he had said. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=870.2s)]
*  And then this quote from this another Alabama Congressman Barry Moore talking about the [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=873.2s)]
*  fact that it was a black police officer who shot a white female gasp. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=881.2s)]
*  Can't they take their Twitter accounts away? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=886.2s)]
*  After those recordings were published tonight, further illustrating how keenly Republicans [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=889.2s)]
*  in leadership were aware that what their own members were doing was going to cause violence. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=897.2s)]
*  Today, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin convened a meeting of dozens, literally dozens [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=902.2s)]
*  of countries from all around the world in support of Ukraine. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=909.2s)]
*  We all start today from a position of moral clarity. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=914.2s)]
*  Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=919.2s)]
*  Ukraine is fighting a war of necessity to defend its democracy, its sovereignty and its citizens. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=927.2s)]
*  But the stakes reach beyond Ukraine and even beyond Europe. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=937.2s)]
*  Russia's invasion is baseless, reckless and lawless. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=943.2s)]
*  It is an affront to the rules-based international order. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=949.2s)]
*  It is a challenge to free people everywhere. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=953.2s)]
*  And as we see this morning, nations of goodwill from around the world stand united in our [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=957.2s)]
*  resolve to support Ukraine. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=963.2s)]
*  My trip to Kiev reinforced my admiration for the way that the Ukrainian armed forces are [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=965.2s)]
*  deploying these capabilities. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=972.2s)]
*  Ukraine clearly believes that it can win. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=975.2s)]
*  And so does everyone here. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=979.2s)]
*  Ukraine clearly believes it can win. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=982.2s)]
*  So does everyone here. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=984.2s)]
*  That was Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin speaking today in Germany. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=986.2s)]
*  And I think the most important thing about what he said there is that when he said, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=990.2s)]
*  so does everyone here, the everyone that he's talking about is a really big everyone. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=994.2s)]
*  He and Secretary of State Antony Blinken convened this meeting today of countries to [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1000.2s)]
*  support Ukraine militarily. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1007.2s)]
*  And this wasn't just a NATO meeting. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1009.2s)]
*  It wasn't even just a meeting of US and our traditional allies. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1011.2s)]
*  This was dozens of countries. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1014.2s)]
*  It was from Kenya to Japan, Tunisia, Iceland, South Korea, New Zealand. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1016.2s)]
*  And yes, of course now, basically all of Europe and all of all of NATO and all of our critical allies. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1023.2s)]
*  But this was like 40 countries. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1031.2s)]
*  Plus, some that didn't even put their name on the list. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1034.2s)]
*  Domestic news sources in Israel, for example, report today that the Israeli government [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1037.2s)]
*  attended this meeting as well, even though Israel didn't put its name on the list of participants. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1042.2s)]
*  Local reporting suggests there may have been a few more than a few other countries, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1047.2s)]
*  including especially Middle Eastern countries that did that same thing as well, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1052.2s)]
*  because they want to and they will participate in militarily supporting Ukraine, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1056.2s)]
*  even if they don't want to write their name down about it officially because they don't want to [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1060.2s)]
*  officially have to talk about it yet. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1064.2s)]
*  It's a remarkable thing. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1067.2s)]
*  This is a very, very large coalition. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1069.2s)]
*  A very large, far-flung coalition convened by the United States in support of Ukraine. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1071.2s)]
*  The Biden administration has pulled together a remarkable list of countries, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1077.2s)]
*  and they're going to hold these meetings in a recurring way. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1081.2s)]
*  They're going to do this every month while Ukraine still needs this much international support. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1084.2s)]
*  How did they do that? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1090.2s)]
*  Do you remember in 2017 when Trump shoved that guy at that conference? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1091.2s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1097.2s)]
*  That was a NATO conference. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1098.2s)]
*  I think it was in Belgium and this little country called Montenegro, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1100.2s)]
*  which is 600,000 people in the whole country. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1104.2s)]
*  Montenegro had spent nine years trying to join NATO. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1106.2s)]
*  Putin didn't want them to join. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1109.2s)]
*  Putin tried to organize a violent coup in Montenegro to stop it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1111.2s)]
*  Russia allegedly plotted the end of the war. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1115.2s)]
*  Russia wanted Montenegro to stop it. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1118.2s)]
*  Russia allegedly plotted the assassination of the country's prime minister to stop it. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1120.2s)]
*  But Montenegro went ahead with it anyway. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1124.2s)]
*  They joined NATO. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1126.2s)]
*  This was their first NATO meeting. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1127.2s)]
*  And Trump came up behind their prime minister and just shoved him [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1129.2s)]
*  and then stood right in front of him. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1133.2s)]
*  And the guy like, reacted, tried to like, laugh it off, make some contact with Trump. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1135.2s)]
*  Trump wouldn't even look at him. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1139.2s)]
*  Just shoved him and walked past him. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1141.2s)]
*  Wouldn't look at him, pretended like he wasn't there. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1143.2s)]
*  That was how Trump treated the newest member of NATO [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1145.2s)]
*  right after he was elected in the spring of 2017. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1149.2s)]
*  Putin didn't like that guy. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1153.2s)]
*  Putin didn't want Montenegro to join NATO. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1155.2s)]
*  So Trump just gives him a shove. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1157.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say not every US president [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1159.2s)]
*  could have done this same job today, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1163.2s)]
*  uniting the world in defense of a country being menaced by Putin. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1166.2s)]
*  I'm not sure we would have seen a convening of the free world like this today [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1171.2s)]
*  under the former guy. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1176.2s)]
*  I'm just going to take a wild guess. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1178.2s)]
*  But the Biden administration has done it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1180.2s)]
*  See the US and Ukraine flags next to each other there. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1182.2s)]
*  About 40 countries are raised in support. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oM99X6cUA8&t=1185.2s)]
