# 'Have your ducks in a row': What to know about the judge in the Trump 2020 case
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s)
*  In the other federal criminal indictment against Donald Trump, the Trump documents indictment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=0.0s)]
*  that's in federal court in Florida, you may have noticed in the news there's been some [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=5.72s)]
*  controversy, it's not exactly the right word, there's been some consternation about the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=10.28s)]
*  federal judge overseeing that case. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=16.04s)]
*  She's a Trump-appointed judge, she's very early on in her career, she's had very few [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=18.0s)]
*  hours on the bench actually overseeing any trials of any kind. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=21.72s)]
*  And in terms of Trump specifically, she was very bluntly smacked down by an appeals court [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=27.08s)]
*  when she went way out of her way to side with Trump in a way that the appeals court said [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=32.52s)]
*  was very inappropriate in an earlier case related to him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  That's the federal documents criminal case against Trump in Florida. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=43.36s)]
*  There's no such controversy with the judge who will be overseeing this new indictment [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  against Trump in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=51.64s)]
*  The judge assigned to this case is named Judge Tanya Chutkin, C-H-U-T-K-A-N, Chutkin. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=54.06s)]
*  She was nominated to the D.C. district court in 2014 by President Barack Obama. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=60.260000000000005s)]
*  And not to be too reductive about it, but I don't think anybody would give you a good [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=65.78s)]
*  faith fight if you described Judge Chutkin as a normal judge, a very normal, uncontroversial, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=70.9s)]
*  well-tested, good, mainstream, smart federal judge. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=79.26s)]
*  I think that's pretty universally her reputation. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=84.10000000000001s)]
*  I should also tell you this is not her first January 6th related case. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=87.14s)]
*  She again sits in federal court in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=91.62s)]
*  And that's where so many of the charges have been brought against hundreds of January 6th [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=94.54s)]
*  defendants. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=98.78s)]
*  Judge Chutkin has presided over about two dozen of the January 6th defendants cases. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=101.22s)]
*  For what it's worth, she has consistently handed down some very tough sentences in those [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=108.6s)]
*  cases when people have been found guilty. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=112.14s)]
*  She is the only judge in any of the January 6th cases who's handed out longer sentences [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=114.25999999999999s)]
*  than DOJ prosecutors even asked for at sentencing. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  You should also know that this isn't Judge Chutkin's first time presiding over a legal [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=123.6s)]
*  matter that involves former President Donald Trump. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=127.08s)]
*  In 2021, during the congressional investigation into January 6th, Trump sued to try and block [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=130.2s)]
*  congressional investigators from accessing some of his records from his time in the White [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=135.84s)]
*  House. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  In that lawsuit, Judge Chutkin ruled against Trump. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  She allowed the January 6th investigators to access his presidential records, and she [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=143.66s)]
*  did it in memorable terms. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=147.68s)]
*  She wrote in her ruling, which you might remember, quote, presidents are not kings. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=150.18s)]
*  That was Judge Chutkin. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=156.86s)]
*  Let's bring in Andrew Weissman again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=158.56s)]
*  He was, of course, one of the senior prosecutors on Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=159.6s)]
*  He also served as FBI general counsel. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=163.08s)]
*  Andrew, on the issue of what's going to happen here next, do you have any impressions that [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=165.84s)]
*  you could share for us of Judge Chutkin and how she runs a courtroom, and also what we [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=171.56s)]
*  should expect on Thursday when Trump will be arraigned before her? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, everything you said about Judge Chutkin is exactly right in terms of her reputation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  In general, the D.C. District Court has really excellent judges, and she is one of them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  It's worth noting that she, prior to being on the bench, was a defense lawyer. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=190.04s)]
*  She is not viewed as somebody who is sort of, oh, you want to be in front of her because [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=195.0s)]
*  you're the government. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  She is one of those judges. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=201.64s)]
*  You need to have your ducks in a row, no matter which side you're on, doesn't suffer fools, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=202.92s)]
*  and there's no nonsense. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=209.68s)]
*  It's exactly what you want from a judge, regardless of what side you're on, if you want sort of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=211.16s)]
*  a good result. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  I think with the arraignment on Thursday, those are usually pretty boring affairs in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  a normal case. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=223.72s)]
*  Somebody enters a plea, there's issues of bail, there's conditions. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=225.92s)]
*  She may, because of local rules, be interested in making sure that the defendant complies [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  with the sort of free press fair trial rules, which is to not make statements that could [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=237.92s)]
*  prejudice a prospective jury. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=242.72s)]
*  That was something that we saw when I was in special counsel Mueller's team, and very [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=246.4s)]
*  famously Roger Stone violated those, as did Paul Manafort. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=250.4s)]
*  I think the big issue for her is that there are now three trials. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=256.2s)]
*  You have Donald Trump, he's been indicted for crimes before, during, and after his presidency, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=261.12s)]
*  and she is going to have to figure out when is she going to be able to slot in her trial. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=268.58s)]
*  I don't know if that will come up at an arraignment. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=274.4s)]
*  She will be interested, though, in moving the case along. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=277.84s)]
*  She'll be very interested in whether discovery has been turned over. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  I expect that we will hear prior to Thursday from the government a report about what they [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=285.0s)]
*  have done with respect to discovery. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=291.2s)]
*  We saw that in the Mar-a-Lago case, and it's the way that the government can try and prompt [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=293.79999999999995s)]
*  the judge to try and be focused on a date prior to the general election. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm736ggvb6s&t=298.72s)]
