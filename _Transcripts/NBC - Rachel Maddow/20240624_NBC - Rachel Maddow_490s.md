# American voters punish Republicans for Supreme Court's revocation of abortion rights
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII)
*  It started in Kansas. Less than two months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=0.0s)]
*  they overturned their constitutional right to an abortion, voters in red, red, red state [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=4.8s)]
*  Kansas resoundingly stood up for abortion rights in their state. Fifty-nine percent [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=9.88s)]
*  of Kansans voting that abortion should stay legal in that state. A few weeks later, Democrats [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=15.66s)]
*  won a special election for an open congressional seat in a swing district in upstate New York [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=21.64s)]
*  with a candidate who made the loss of abortion rights the centerpiece of his campaign. A [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=27.12s)]
*  week after that, in Alaska, another Democrat won another special election in the House, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=31.8s)]
*  this time flipping a seat from red to blue, also running on a pro-abortion rights platform. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=36.92s)]
*  I should mention only 12 percent of Alaska voters are Democrats, but the Democrat won [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=43.44s)]
*  that seat. Then a few months later, in November 2022, we had the first big nationwide election [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=48.72s)]
*  since they overturned Roe, and more Democrats ran aggressive campaigns focused on reproductive [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=55.8s)]
*  rights. And in those elections in November 2022, Republicans suffered historically poor [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=61.12s)]
*  results, the worst for an opposition party in decades. Beyond the congressional races [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=66.92s)]
*  that day, there were five more states that put abortion directly on the ballot, and in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=73.2s)]
*  all five of those states, voters moved toward abortion rights and away from abortion restrictions. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=78.8s)]
*  The reproductive rights victories continued the following year, affecting the race for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=86.2s)]
*  a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and the race for the Kentucky governorship, and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=91.04s)]
*  the race for control of the legislature in Virginia. Also, the state constitution in [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=99.12s)]
*  Ohio, where voters chose to enshrine the right to have an abortion in the Ohio state constitution. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  Since the fall of Roe two years ago today, the political impact has been indelible and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=112.52s)]
*  stark and remarkably consistent. And that has been bolstered by what the overturning [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=119.52s)]
*  of Roe has changed in the minds of the American people. It's a new understanding that the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=125.52s)]
*  question of reproductive rights is not just about accessing abortion, it is about what [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=131.92s)]
*  happens if you have a miscarriage, or you go into septic shock during pregnancy, or [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=137.52s)]
*  you have any other dangerous form of complication, and you can't access healthcare because the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=142.4s)]
*  state you live in has banned abortion. One pollster telling the New York Times today [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=148.08s)]
*  that before Roe fell, the percentage of the public that considered abortion personally [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  relevant to them was as low as about 15 percent. But in the post-Roe landscape that we live [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=157.88s)]
*  in now, that has changed. Her more recent polling asked independent voters about the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=163.28s)]
*  stories of women almost dying because they live in states that have banned abortion. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=168.2s)]
*  Of independent voters, she polled, who support abortion rights, the number who said those [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=173.24s)]
*  stories will affect how they will vote in upcoming elections is 73 percent. The pollster [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=177.08s)]
*  tells the New York Times, quote, Now it's about pregnancy. And everybody knows someone [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=183.28s)]
*  who had a baby or wants to have a baby or might get pregnant. It is profoundly personal to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=188.60000000000002s)]
*  a majority of the public. Joining us now is Amy Klobuchar, Democratic Senator from the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=194.24s)]
*  great state of Minnesota. She's a member of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Klobuchar, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=200.28s)]
*  it's really nice to see you. Thank you so much for making time to be here. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=203.68s)]
*  Thanks, Rachel. It's great to be on again. So today is the two-year anniversary since [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  Roe was overturned. We know a lot about the human cost. We know about, for example, new [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  research just published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which says [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=220.52s)]
*  that it has adversely and seriously affected infant mortality in that state with its profound [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=224.52s)]
*  abortion ban. What do you think is most important for the American public to understand on this [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=231.68s)]
*  two-year anniversary since the decision was made for the country? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=236.84s)]
*  You know, I think everyone remembers where they were when this thought-to-be-leaked opinion [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  was—you found out it was a real opinion. I was at the—getting my hair cut, and there [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  was a line of four women at the hairdressers. And everyone in the place said, That just [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  can't be true. And two years later, oh, we know how true it is. Fifty years of freedom [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=257.0s)]
*  just thrown out the window. You've got IVF affected. Eight million babies were born that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=262.64s)]
*  You've got contraception affected. You have got doctors in fear of criminal prosecution. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=268.56s)]
*  You've got women bleeding out in parking lots because they are told in an emergency [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=274.64s)]
*  room, Hey, you've got to be more serious. We know you're in bad health, but we've [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=279.68s)]
*  got to be kind of near death to be able to get the kind of treatment you need. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=284.68s)]
*  One in three women are now living in a state with an extreme abortion ban. That is our [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=289.12s)]
*  current reality, Rachel, but it does not have to be our future. And that's what you [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=294.28s)]
*  see in these states all across the country with people turning out on the prairies, people [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  turning out for referendums and for governor's races and U.S. Senate races, and of course [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=305.52s)]
*  the presidency, because it is so clear—and you're going to hear this on that debate [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=310.52s)]
*  stage—when one of the candidates, Donald Trump, said he is proud to be the person responsible [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=314.76s)]
*  for overturning Roe, and then you've got Joe Biden vowing to codify Roe v. Wade into [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=321.56s)]
*  law, so long as we elect these candidates and we know we need to take back the House [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=328.56s)]
*  and win these Senate races. That is what is at stake in this election. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=333.28s)]
*  I think that a lot of people who are strongly for abortion rights, whether they were before [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=338.56s)]
*  this decision or they newly are strongly for abortion rights, worry that this is something [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=343.84s)]
*  that the Supreme Court has taken on, that Republican legislatures have taken on, and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=349.48s)]
*  they've effectively taken it out of the hands of somebody like Joe Biden, who supports [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=354.36s)]
*  abortion rights, that when he talks about codifying Roe v. Wade, I'm not sure people [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=359.28s)]
*  know what that means in terms of what it would do in all of these states where state laws, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=363.64s)]
*  where Republican legislators and Republican governors have enforced these bans. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=368.08s)]
*  Well, we know it is time to have a national standard, which is Roe v. Wade. That will [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=373.2s)]
*  guarantee our freedoms, because what Trump has now said is that he wants to return it [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=380.2s)]
*  to the states. What does that mean? Look at what these states are doing. One state, Texas, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=385.36s)]
*  with that Trump-appointed judge—and, yes, the judges are on the line here—the Trump-appointed [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=390.24s)]
*  judge banning Miffl-Pristone. You've got another state where they're going to criminally [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=394.64s)]
*  prosecute doctors. Another state says they don't want to have people cross lines to [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=399.28s)]
*  get their reproductive healthcare. State by state by state, you saw governors racing to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=404.32s)]
*  their statehouse to see how draconian they could be to kiss the ring of Donald Trump. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  That is what is going on right now. So that is a clear difference. And I think, as you [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=414.76s)]
*  show with your proof points from across the country, people do see the difference. They [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=419.28s)]
*  know that there is one person who's going to stand up for them, and then there's Donald [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=425.24s)]
*  Trump, who has vowed over the years everything he has said, from, yes, he'd prosecute doctors, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=429.16s)]
*  to yes, he would look at a national ban, to yes, most recently, hey, let's give it back [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  to the states. Look at the patchwork of laws that we have had that have hurt the women [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=442.76000000000005s)]
*  of this country. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=447.68s)]
*  Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, thank you so much for your time tonight. It's the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=449.48s)]
*  anniversary now, but we're also in this very, very, very acute political moment. I think [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=454.56s)]
*  people are really focusing in on how much this is tied to what happens next, these next [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  political decisions we make as a country. Thanks for helping us understand it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. Thanks, Rachel. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-Wvs6E1gII&t=467.08s)]
