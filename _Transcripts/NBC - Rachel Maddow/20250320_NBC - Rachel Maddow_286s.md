# Walz reacts to NYT report that Pentagon will brief Musk on secret plan for potential war with China
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM)
*  Governor, since we've been on the air tonight, a story has broken in The New York Times, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=0.0s)]
*  and it has broken since I have been on the air. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=4.54s)]
*  And so I have not—I am not fully read in on this. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=6.16s)]
*  But I know that you've at least seen the headline. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=8.82s)]
*  And I want to ask you, just for your reaction to this, it's a pretty shocking story. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  The headline is, Musk, meaning Elon Musk, set to get access to top-secret U.S. plan [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=14.92s)]
*  for potential war with China. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  The lead is this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Pentagon is scheduled tomorrow, Friday, to brief Elon Musk on the U.S. military's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=25.4s)]
*  plan for any war that might break out with China. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=29.96s)]
*  One official confirming to The Times that Musk is to be at the Pentagon on Friday, but [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=33.599999999999994s)]
*  offering no details. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=37.04s)]
*  Mr. Musk, of course, has extensive financial interests in China, and so this, I think, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=38.04s)]
*  is raising lots of alarm bells for a lot of different people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=43.04s)]
*  The Pentagon's war plans, known in military jargon as O-plans or operational plans, are [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  among the military's most closely guarded secrets. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=51.8s)]
*  If a foreign country was to learn how the U.S. planned to fight a war against them, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=54.8s)]
*  it could reinforce its defenses and address its weaknesses, making the plans far less [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=57.72s)]
*  likely to succeed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  The top-secret briefing for the China war plan has 20 to 30 slides that lay out how [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=63.12s)]
*  the U.S. would fight such a conflict. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  It covers various options on what Chinese targets the U.S. could hit over what time [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  period. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=75.92s)]
*  And these would be the options that would be presented to Mr. Trump for decisions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=77.1s)]
*  For some reason, they've decided to show Elon Musk this level of detail about a potential [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=80.62s)]
*  war with China while he operates the largest Tesla—largest car factory, I believe, in [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=86.18s)]
*  China and has immense financial interests in that country and contacts with that country's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  government that he has not disclosed to the U.S. as part of maintaining his security clearance. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=98.22s)]
*  I just got to get your reaction to that, sir. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=102.82000000000001s)]
*  Well, speechless would be the word. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=108.42s)]
*  I don't know how to convey—I don't possess the language ability to convey how far out [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=110.82s)]
*  of the norm this is, like nothing that people are listening. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=115.9s)]
*  Like, look, this is—those of us who served, the background checks from the FBI, just to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=120.02s)]
*  receive clearance as an artillery-enlisted soldier, was extensive to get that background. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=125.26s)]
*  And then the level of information that you can get, or as a member of Congress, to be [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=131.78s)]
*  able to have access to this type of information. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=135.98s)]
*  These are closely guarded secrets because our national and our global defense depends [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=138.46s)]
*  upon them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=143.22s)]
*  And once again, we have this—I don't know, the character, the world's richest man with [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=144.22s)]
*  the world's most fragile ego. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=150.58s)]
*  And I don't understand where the Republicans, where are Lindsey Graham, where are these [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=153.1s)]
*  people who know how this works, to not be terrified of where this is at? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  And again, seeing the Commerce Secretary today tell people to go buy a specific stock, and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  not jesting, not in that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=171.1s)]
*  And look, I have to be very careful, because I'll be candid. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=172.5s)]
*  I think this guy is deeply damaged, a buffoon, but I also don't want to elevate him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=175.78s)]
*  He is unelected. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=182.78s)]
*  He does not know how this stuff works. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=184.22s)]
*  And Donald Trump is being reckless with the most sensitive data. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=186.78s)]
*  So, I want to try and provide some assurance to the American people. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=191.82000000000002s)]
*  But I also think our leadership needs to be very clear about not sugarcoating this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  And Donald Trump obviously disrespects the American public. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  He thinks they're not smart enough to understand this and doesn't care. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=205.3s)]
*  I do believe the American public knows, and I do believe when they see stories like this, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=209.06s)]
*  that this is why these town halls are growing so big. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  This is why folks are starting to question. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  And what I truly worry that I get sucked into, too, is they throw so much at it, it's, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=220.38s)]
*  this is the stuff that you should watch. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=226.78s)]
*  This is the disappearing people sharing our most guarded secrets on global conflict with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  a truly unstable private citizen who has no authority and appears to not care. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=236.62s)]
*  So, yeah, I would just say this is chilling. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=244.78s)]
*  I'm hoping that the resistance, and right now the resistance, has to be in the Senate. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=249.34s)]
*  Republican senators need to put a stop to this and pull this back. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=254.06s)]
*  Minnesota Governor Tim Walsh, sir, thank you for making time to be here tonight. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=259.86s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=262.86s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=265.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubBnUCXj4iM&t=279.26s)]
