# From Alex Jones to neo-Nazis, civil lawsuits offer a means of fighting a public menace
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM)
*  You may have seen the news this weekend that Alex Jones, the Florida conspiracy theorist and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=0.0s)]
*  purveyor of very, very man-made dietary supplements, he's trying to figure out a way to get out of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=5.04s)]
*  paying almost all of the billion and a half dollars that he has been assigned to pay to the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=11.6s)]
*  families he was found guilty of defaming. These are families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=18.48s)]
*  Elementary School massacre. They filed a civil suit against Alex Jones for the years that Mr. Jones [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  spent calling that massacre a hoax on his media network. A court awarded those families a billion [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=30.08s)]
*  and a half dollars in damages from Alex Jones. Mr. Jones is now asking them, okay, well, would you take [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=37.2s)]
*  roughly three and a half percent of that instead? How about a 96 percent discount [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=44.64s)]
*  off those damages? How about I propose to pay you not $1.5 billion, but $55 million? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=49.92s)]
*  That's his offer in bankruptcy court. The Sandy Hook families, you will not be surprised to learn, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=55.92s)]
*  have a different idea. They say, hey, how about instead we just liquidate your business assets [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=63.28s)]
*  right now, including your media company, and give the proceeds to the families? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=67.2s)]
*  Mr. Jones would be allowed to keep his house, but Alex Jones, Incorporated, goes away permanently. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  In other words, we don't want to share in your profits. We want your company, which profited for [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=79.36s)]
*  so many years off of our grief, we want that company gone. Another example of what a civil suit [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=84.0s)]
*  can do, the $148 million jury verdict against Rudy Giuliani for the lies he spread about two [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=89.36s)]
*  Georgia election workers, lies about them stealing the election from Donald Trump, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=96.8s)]
*  lies that upended their lives. Nobody knows what Mr. Giuliani is capable of paying or what this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  judgment might mean for him and his livelihood. But now those two election workers today filed a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=106.4s)]
*  new lawsuit against Giuliani because even after that $148 million verdict against him, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=112.16s)]
*  he went immediately right back to spouting the same lies that got him slapped with that huge [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  judgment. Civil suits have also, though, been used strategically against, for lack of a better term, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=122.32s)]
*  neo-Nazis. You may recall the civil lawsuit that was filed against the white nationalist [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=130.72s)]
*  neo-Nazi organizers of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017 that resulted in a jury [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  award of over $26 million in damages against the organizers. That kind of penalty can restrict the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  ability of groups like that to operate. It can even potentially put them out of business entirely. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=150.72s)]
*  Well, keep that in mind. Now that we know we have a couple new lawsuits, a couple new legal actions [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=156.72s)]
*  along those same lines, taken within days of one another, one by the attorney general of the state [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=162.64s)]
*  of Massachusetts, one by the attorney general of the state of New Hampshire. Each of them have taken [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  legal action against the white nationalist group NSC 131, 113. This is how these groups like to be [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  known, these guys, by their acronym. NSC, to be clear, NSC stands for National Socialist Club, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  as in National Socialism, as in Nazis. These guys are self-declared Nazis. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=188.16s)]
*  And in both states, the group is being sued for violent harassment and intimidation of minorities [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=192.48s)]
*  and immigrants. But the group has been engaged in all kinds of activity like this across New England [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=198.8s)]
*  for the past several years. New Hampshire filed its first civil suit against the group earlier [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=204.72s)]
*  this year after the group hung a Keep New England White banner off a highway overpass. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=211.04s)]
*  That suit was dismissed, but now the group is facing two of these legal actions in two states. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=217.12s)]
*  How effective is that likely to be? How good is this as a tactic against this kind of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=223.84s)]
*  terroristic menace? Joining us now is Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=229.84s)]
*  Her office has just taken legal action against this neo-Nazi group in New England. Ms. Campbell, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=236.08s)]
*  thanks very much for your time this evening. I appreciate you being here. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=240.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=242.88000000000002s)]
*  So first of all, let me just ask you, I didn't explain it in fulsome detail, but [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=245.12s)]
*  did I get the basics right here in terms of the idea behind this legal action? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  Pretty much. I mean, this is like you described a self-proclaimed neo-Nazi group founded here in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=256.32s)]
*  Massachusetts, sadly, that has put out publicly that they think that New England is and should [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=262.88s)]
*  be only for white people in a certain type of white demographic. And we're not going after them [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  because of those beliefs. Frankly, I've been saying if they held those beliefs in meetings [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=276.08s)]
*  in private settings, I probably wouldn't attend the meeting. But that's not where we're going [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=280.88s)]
*  after them. We're going after them because of just the horrific conduct and unlawful conduct [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=285.2s)]
*  of terrorizing folks of different demographics all across the Commonwealth, whether migrants, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=291.12s)]
*  those in LGBTQ plus community, or anyone, and saying that conduct is unlawful and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=296.4s)]
*  unacceptable here in Massachusetts. And so we think we have a pretty strong case. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=301.67999999999995s)]
*  We're excited to also see New Hampshire also launch a complaint, which I think is very powerful [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=305.67999999999995s)]
*  to have a Republican attorney general and a Democratic AG taking on this group for their [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=310.08s)]
*  conduct here and of course across New England. And it's an important point that this is a [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=314.64s)]
*  nonpartisan situation here in New England, that we've got a Republican AG in New Hampshire [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=322.0s)]
*  taking action there under the state's non-discrimination laws. You're a Democrat [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=326.08s)]
*  in Massachusetts taking a slightly different approach, but targeting the same group. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  Can you just explain, I'm trying to think kind of big picture and nationwide about the options [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=333.84s)]
*  that law enforcement officials have in terms of using the legal system in constructive ways, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  both to protect the constitution, but also to protect people from this kind of menace. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=346.56s)]
*  Why did you see the advantage here of civil litigation and civil litigation of this kind [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  in a best case scenario? What do you think the impact of the litigation will be? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=356.0s)]
*  So there are some criminal aspects to their conduct and there have been district attorneys [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=361.36s)]
*  in Massachusetts that have attempted to take that on and sometimes unsuccessfully. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=367.44s)]
*  They're very difficult cases to prosecute. But here we have not only a strong basis under our [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=371.36s)]
*  civil rights law, which are quite progressive in Massachusetts to going after the conduct [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=377.76s)]
*  of this group. But in addition to that, for violations of our trespass laws, our nuisance [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=381.68s)]
*  laws and our public accommodation laws. And our goal is to seek injunctive relief, to get them [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=387.52s)]
*  to stop what they're doing, patrolling people's neighborhoods, targeting particular demographics, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=393.76s)]
*  and thereby blocking the access sometimes to public spaces, for example, for all of us. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=398.8s)]
*  I've been telling folks this isn't just about targeting specific groups. This is about blocking [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  access and violating the rights of many residents in Massachusetts and those who visit Massachusetts. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=408.32s)]
*  So we think we have a strong case. But the other hook that is really important, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=414.4s)]
*  as we seek injunctive relief here, if they violate our civil rights law in that injunction, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=417.68s)]
*  we can see criminal penalties. So there's a range of options available to us. We're at the beginning [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=424.0s)]
*  stages, but I think it sets the tone that we're going to take on this type of behavior and not [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=428.88s)]
*  just allow it to persist in Massachusetts going forward. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooLKgjJacM&t=435.12s)]
