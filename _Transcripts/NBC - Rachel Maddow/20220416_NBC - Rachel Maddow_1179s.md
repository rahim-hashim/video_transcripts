# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 15
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0)
*  But Russia is also ramping up its threats to try and ward off more Western intervention. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=0.0s)]
*  The Washington Post was first to report that Russian officials have sent a formal diplomatic [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=4.4s)]
*  message to the United States warning that US and NATO shipments of the most sensitive [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=8.56s)]
*  weapon systems to Ukraine were adding fuel to the conflict there and could bring unpredictable [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  consequences. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=18.52s)]
*  Now, that may sound like more bluster from an increasingly isolated world leader, but [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=19.52s)]
*  the threat of unpredictable consequences is sadly not an empty one. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=24.32s)]
*  Yesterday, the head of the CIA made that point very clear during a public speech. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=28.56s)]
*  Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=35.08s)]
*  setbacks that they've faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=40.76s)]
*  by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low yield nuclear weapons. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=47.96s)]
*  In an interview with CNN, Ukrainian President Zelensky echoed those sentiments, saying the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  world should prepare for the possibility of a nuclear strike inside of Ukraine. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=58.44s)]
*  There have been differing opinions from experts about the threat of a Russian nuclear strike [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  since this war began. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=67.84s)]
*  But there is no question that Russia's nuclear arsenal hangs like a sword of Damocles over [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=69.52s)]
*  every decision Western powers make in this conflict. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=73.6s)]
*  If Russia were to resort to using a nuclear weapon inside of Ukraine, tactical or not, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=76.84s)]
*  it would be the first nuclear strike by any nation since the devastating US bombing of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=81.28s)]
*  Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=86.28s)]
*  It would irrevocably change the world in ways we cannot wave off or ignore. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=89.16s)]
*  So the big question remains as Russia ratchets up its threats to the West just in time for [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=94.32s)]
*  its new assault on eastern Ukraine, what can we in the West do without provoking a nuclear [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  war with Putin? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is retired four star Air Force General Philip Breedlove. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=106.6s)]
*  General Breedlove served as NATO Supreme Allied Commander from 2013 to 2016. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=110.08s)]
*  He's now a distinguished chair of the Frontier Europe Initiative at the Middle East Institute. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=114.76s)]
*  General, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=119.08s)]
*  Let me start by asking you about the situation in Mariupol. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=121.08s)]
*  I saw a video today from a journalist from the Kyiv Independence showing what's left [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=124.4s)]
*  of the city, which is practically nothing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=128.76s)]
*  And this reporter rightly points out that if Russia takes control of the city, they [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=131.12s)]
*  will only keep the land because there's really nothing left there in terms of infrastructure. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=134.72s)]
*  Explain to our viewers, General, why Mariupol is so strategically important to the Russians [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=139.84s)]
*  to the point that they'll destroy it in order to take it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=143.76s)]
*  Mariupol is key for several reasons. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=147.6s)]
*  Thanks for having me on tonight. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  It is one of the two remaining large ports in Ukraine that keep Ukraine connected to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  the rest of the world for commerce and shipment of grain, etc. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=158.88s)]
*  And it is a key spot in that land bridge that has been talked so much about from the Lugansk [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=163.56s)]
*  Donetsk area in Donbas down along the coast towards Crimea. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  So this is a key piece of terrain and it's very sad to see it fall. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=178.16s)]
*  We heard reports today that some of the soldiers there were having to surrender because they [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=182.54s)]
*  ran out of bullets and they ran out of food. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=187.64s)]
*  And this is a failure of us, I think, in the West to get all the supplies they needed into [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=190.44s)]
*  them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  And the fall of Mariupol would be a huge blow to Ukrainian morale, not to mention a humanitarian [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=197.4s)]
*  crisis, would it not? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=202.08s)]
*  It would. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=204.88s)]
*  And sadly, what we will probably find in Mariupol is the same thing that we found in the North [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=205.88s)]
*  from where the Russians have left their fingerprints in terror and in war crimes in an area. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=212.32s)]
*  So this is going to be another tough slog to get through what we find in Mariupol. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  General, you have said in recent interviews that you think the United States has been [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=226.28s)]
*  completely deterred by Russia's nukes and Putin, meanwhile, is undeterred. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=229.52s)]
*  You have called in the past for a no-fly zone, a limited no-fly zone. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=234.32s)]
*  You have said we shouldn't exaggerate the threat from Russian nukes to the point where [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  we don't do anything. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=240.88s)]
*  And yet CIA Director Bill Burns, who dealt with Putin, of course, directly as ambassador [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=242.28s)]
*  to Moscow in the past, he said yesterday, we can't take lightly the prospect that Putin [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=246.52s)]
*  would use tactical nukes inside of Ukraine. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=251.56s)]
*  Do you disagree with Director Burns? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=254.6s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=257.4s)]
*  I think that we have to take serious a lot of these threats. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=258.4s)]
*  Mr. Putin has written about this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=263.08s)]
*  Mr. Gorosimov, a senior general, has written about this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=265.04s)]
*  They often say that nuclear weapons are a logical extension of the conventional battlefield, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=268.52s)]
*  whereas we see that completely differently in the West. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=275.6s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is Mr. Putin is extremely good at deterring us. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=278.84000000000003s)]
*  And he is doing this to deter us. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=284.2s)]
*  And as I understand now, he's declared that our weapons shipments to Ukraine will now [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=287.84s)]
*  cause new possibilities for him. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=293.0s)]
*  And so we are deterred. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=297.92s)]
*  And he's seeking to further deter us because it's worked so far. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=300.56s)]
*  So I just want to get to the bottom of this deterrence point. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=308.76s)]
*  It's deeply frustrating to see the way that Putin can almost blackmail the West with his [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=309.76s)]
*  nuclear arsenal. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=313.82s)]
*  But reality is reality. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=315.14s)]
*  If you're saying that you agree with Bill Burns, that he could use tactical nuclear [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=316.3s)]
*  weapons, then we kind of have to be deterred, do we not? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=319.7s)]
*  Or are you saying we can edge forward, we can push forward with more weapons, maybe [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=322.58s)]
*  a no-fly zone as you've advocated in the past, without triggering that use of, God forbid, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=327.58s)]
*  tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=332.82s)]
*  In our past, we have done this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=334.7s)]
*  In northern Syria, under a different administration, we took almost a battalion of Russians off [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=336.78s)]
*  the battlefield. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=342.70000000000005s)]
*  And we were in the same situation with the same Putin and the same nuclear arsenal facing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  us in that attack. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=349.06s)]
*  And so it's just a matter of assessing the risks and then taking the appropriate actions. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=351.1s)]
*  And I think that we need to have those conversations about risks now. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=358.26000000000005s)]
*  The sad news is I believe there are people in this world who believe there's no risk if [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=364.14000000000004s)]
*  we do nothing. And I believe we incur more risk every day. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  You're 100 percent right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=373.66s)]
*  There is risk on both sides. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=375.3s)]
*  And we do need to have these conversations. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=376.54s)]
*  And we are having this conversation. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=378.1s)]
*  I appreciate you having it with me. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  The Syrian example, though, correct me if I'm wrong, wasn't that a group of Russian [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=380.66s)]
*  mercenaries that were killed in Syria? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=383.90000000000003s)]
*  And of course, Syria doesn't mean the same to Putin as Ukraine does. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=385.82000000000005s)]
*  That was the Wagner Group. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=389.62s)]
*  And as you know, and all the world knows, the Wagner Group is an extension of the Russian [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  military. So we took Russian military off the battlefield in northern Syria. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=396.82000000000005s)]
*  I guess the way I see it and you and I may disagree on this is I worry that on the one [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=403.62s)]
*  hand, we say Vladimir Putin is a genocidal, warmongering, war crime committing madman, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=407.5s)]
*  the worst leader since Hitler, in which case we really have to take a nuclear threat [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=412.02000000000004s)]
*  seriously from a leader like that, or he's bluffing. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=415.74s)]
*  He'll never use them, in which case maybe he's not the threat we think he is. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=417.98s)]
*  We can't have it both ways, can we? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=421.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, I don't draw the two distinctions that you do. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=424.02000000000004s)]
*  I think there's a middle ground. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=426.70000000000005s)]
*  I don't think he's bluffing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=428.38s)]
*  I think if it goes bad enough for him, he may actually take these more drastic [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=429.9s)]
*  actions. But if we allow the world to deter us in this way, then every nation that [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=435.21999999999997s)]
*  has a nuke looks up and says, OK, I now know how to deal with the United States [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=442.86s)]
*  over Taiwan. I now know how to deal with the United States over South Korea. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=448.3s)]
*  I now know how to deal with the United States over the missiles I'd like to fire [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=454.1s)]
*  into the Middle East. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=458.94s)]
*  And so I think that at some point we have to understand that if we are going to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=460.41999999999996s)]
*  allow ourselves to be nuclear blackmailed in every endeavor, then we're going to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=465.09999999999997s)]
*  have a tough time in the world ahead. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=469.85999999999996s)]
*  I guess there's never been a better argument for nuclear disarmament. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=473.09999999999997s)]
*  One last question, General, after the massacre in Butch and the destruction of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=476.58s)]
*  Mariupol and other attacks by Russian troops in Ukraine, it's very unlikely that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=479.94s)]

*  time soon, even though the president of Ukraine keeps offering Putin a chance [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=487.7s)]
*  for a meeting. Is there any diplomatic off-ramp we can provide to the Russian [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=491.18s)]
*  president to try and persuade him to end his brutal war, which has taken so many [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=494.65999999999997s)]
*  lives, to declare whatever fake victory he wants and just go home? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=498.14s)]
*  Well, I think that's going to be very tough, but you have hit it right on the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=503.06s)]
*  head. We all want a negotiated ending to this. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=506.78s)]
*  But what we don't want is for Ukraine to have to give up its sovereign territory [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=511.06s)]
*  and its sovereignty as a nation. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=516.62s)]
*  And so we need to support President Zelensky, who is a wartime leader of the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=519.06s)]
*  highest caliber. We need to support him and prepare his troops so that they can [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=525.4599999999999s)]
*  earn a better negotiation position at the table. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=531.26s)]
*  Retired four-star Air Force general and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=536.9s)]

*  I appreciate it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=542.54s)]
*  The senior senator from the great state of Utah is a Republican named Mike Lee. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=543.18s)]
*  He's held that job for a little over a decade. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=549.6999999999999s)]
*  And on January the 6th, just as the attack on the Capitol was getting started, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=551.7399999999999s)]
*  Senator Lee's cell phone rang. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=555.14s)]
*  Here is how he remembers it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=557.26s)]
*  Quote, The caller ID indicated that the call was coming from the White House. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=558.5s)]
*  To my great surprise, it was President Trump on the other end of the line. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=562.42s)]
*  There was a lot of noise and commotion in the room, but I thought I heard him say, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=566.4599999999999s)]
*  How's it going, Tommy? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=569.66s)]
*  Tommy? Who's Tommy? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=571.66s)]
*  Turns out the president dialed the wrong number. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=573.42s)]
*  He was looking for this guy, Tommy Tuberville, the newly elected senator from [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=575.1s)]
*  Alabama. Senator Tuberville was a vocal supporter of Donald Trump's big lie. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=578.82s)]
*  And that's why the president was trying to call him on January the 6th to ask him [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=583.5s)]
*  to try and delay the certification of the election in Congress. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=587.22s)]
*  Instead, the former president got Mike Lee on the phone by mistake. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=590.82s)]
*  And yes, Mike Lee is a Republican, but there was a reason that the president was [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=594.18s)]
*  not calling him on purpose to try and get him to go along with his scheme to [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=598.02s)]
*  overturn the election that day. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=601.62s)]
*  Senator Lee was not a vocal public proponent of Donald Trump's big lie. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=603.38s)]
*  He voted on January the 6th in favor of certifying the election results for Joe [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=607.62s)]
*  Biden. Mike Lee told journalist Bob Woodward that he personally looked into some [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=611.46s)]
*  of Trump's claims of supposed voter fraud and did not think any of it checked out. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=615.54s)]
*  He says he disagreed with Trump's claim that Vice President Pence had the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=620.02s)]
*  authority to stop the certification of the election. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=623.5s)]
*  By all public accounts, Utah Senator Mike Lee portrayed himself as a proud [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=627.02s)]
*  defender of the Constitution, someone with absolute fidelity to it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=631.78s)]
*  But it turns out in private, Lee was actually just pushing for a different way [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=635.74s)]
*  to overturn the election. Today, CNN was first to obtain text messages that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=640.5s)]
*  Senator Lee sent to the president's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in the few weeks [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=644.74s)]
*  after the election. These are text messages that have been turned over to the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=648.54s)]
*  January 6th investigation in Congress. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=652.34s)]
*  I should mention that NBC News has not yet obtained or verified these texts. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=654.66s)]
*  In the messages, Mike Lee repeatedly says that there is only one surefire way [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=659.0999999999999s)]
*  to overturn the election. And it has nothing to do with conspiracies about [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=663.9399999999999s)]
*  suitcases full of ballot papers or Italian satellites or Krakens. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=667.5s)]
*  It's about the fake elective scheme, the idea that states that actually went for [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=671.8599999999999s)]
*  Biden could submit a fake slate of electives to Congress for Trump. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=676.3s)]
*  So that if Mike Pence refused to certify the results, these fake Trump electors [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=681.1s)]
*  would be on record to flip the election in Trump's favor. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=685.22s)]
*  On December the 8th, a few weeks after the election, Mike Lee writes to Mark [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=688.98s)]
*  Meadows, Trump White House chief of staff at the time, quote, If a very small [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=692.4200000000001s)]
*  handful of states were to have their legislatures appoint alternative states [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=696.0200000000001s)]
*  of delegates, there could be a path. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=699.4200000000001s)]
*  A month later, he raises his concerns about the way his Senate colleagues have [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=702.46s)]
*  gone about trying to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election results. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=706.1400000000001s)]
*  Mike Lee wants the president to know that his fake elective scheme has a much [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=709.5400000000001s)]
*  better shot of success. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=713.26s)]
*  He says, quote, I really think this could all backfire badly unless we have [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=714.74s)]
*  legislatures submitting Trump slates. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=718.5400000000001s)]
*  Later on that same day, he hits it again. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=721.26s)]
*  We need something from state legislatures to make this legitimate and to have any [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=723.1800000000001s)]
*  hope of winning. Even if they can't convene, it might be enough if a majority [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=727.22s)]
*  of them are willing to sign a statement indicating how they would vote. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=730.86s)]
*  And I've been working on doing that all day today. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=733.98s)]
*  Here's why this matters so much right now. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=736.78s)]
*  The fake elective scheme is a play that Republicans could very likely try to run [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=739.38s)]
*  again to overturn the election results in 2024 if the Democrats win the White [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=743.5s)]
*  House again. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=748.06s)]
*  It is truly shocking to hear a sitting member of the Senate advocate, advocate, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=749.38s)]
*  excuse me, for such a plan. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=754.06s)]
*  Though actually maybe a little less surprising coming from Senator Mike Lee, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=755.8199999999999s)]
*  given that he tweeted right before the 2020 election that he does not believe [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=759.66s)]
*  the United States is a democracy. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=764.34s)]
*  So what do we do to save our institutions when the people constitutionally tasked [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=768.62s)]
*  with protecting them are in fact the ones who pose the biggest threat? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=773.3000000000001s)]
*  The message is read, quote, This fight is about the fundamental fairness and [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=779.94s)]
*  integrity of our election system. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=784.26s)]

*  President. And we need ammo. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=790.38s)]
*  We need fraud examples. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=792.82s)]
*  We need it this weekend. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=794.1s)]
*  As we've been talking about tonight, those are just two of about 100 messages sent [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=795.82s)]
*  by Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Republican Congressman Chip Roy of [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=799.38s)]
*  Texas to then White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows shortly after the election. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=803.34s)]
*  The texts were reported by CNN. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=807.82s)]
*  NBC News has not independently verified those texts. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=809.62s)]
*  The two lawmakers were encouraging Meadows to do everything he could to bolster the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=812.74s)]
*  president's claims that the 2020 election was stolen. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=816.46s)]
*  Find the proof. Find the ammo. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=819.82s)]
*  We know for sure now that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud in any [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=822.38s)]
*  state that impacted the election results. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=825.98s)]
*  But we learned this week that Mark Meadows might have been able to offer up his own [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=828.14s)]
*  ballot as the example of voter fraud his friends so desperately sought. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=831.38s)]
*  The former chief of staff was removed from the voting roles in North Carolina after [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=836.18s)]
*  state election fraud investigators found that he was registered in both North [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=840.54s)]
*  Carolina and Virginia. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=844.38s)]
*  He last voted in North Carolina in 2020. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=846.5799999999999s)]
*  His registration is tied to a single wide mobile home that there is no evidence of [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=849.3000000000001s)]
*  him ever actually living in. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=853.82s)]
*  The State Bureau of Investigation is still investigating. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=856.0600000000001s)]
*  We will see if he faces any consequences, which is an open question when you look [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=859.4200000000001s)]
*  at the history of who tends to face real consequences for behavior like this. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=863.34s)]
*  Over in Florida, two men from a retirement community called the Villagers are facing [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=868.46s)]
*  their own consequences for their admitted voter fraud. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=873.66s)]
*  The two men pled guilty this week to casting multiple ballots for the 2020 [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=876.14s)]
*  election, a felony that carries a maximum five year prison sentence. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=880.22s)]
*  They were sentenced to 50 hours of community service and a 12 week adult civics [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=883.98s)]
*  class, among some other requirements. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=888.9s)]
*  As long as they manage that, they will face no further punishments for voter [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=891.58s)]
*  fraud. Those kinds of light sentences for white guys who knowingly cast fraudulent [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=894.78s)]
*  ballots seem to be a trend. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=899.58s)]
*  It was Bruce Bartman of Pennsylvania who cast an absentee ballot for Donald Trump [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=901.8199999999999s)]
*  under his dead mother's name. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=905.58s)]
*  He got five years probation. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=907.7800000000001s)]
*  And there was Edward Snodgrass, a Republican official from Ohio. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=909.7s)]
*  He cast an extra ballot for his dead father. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=912.94s)]
*  He got three days in jail and a five hundred dollar fine. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=915.5400000000001s)]
*  Then there was another man from Pennsylvania, Robert Richard Lynn, who applied [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=919.26s)]
*  for an absentee ballot under his dead mother's name. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=923.0600000000001s)]
*  He got six months probation. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=925.7s)]
*  There was also Donald Kirk Hartle from Nevada who cast a ballot for his dead wife. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=927.6600000000001s)]

*  Her ballot was ultimately never counted. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=952.14s)]
*  Again, it was provisional and it was rejected. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=953.82s)]
*  And yet she was sentenced to five years in prison for attempting to vote. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=956.98s)]
*  Late in 2020, Crystal Mason filed a petition with the Texas Court of Criminal [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=962.86s)]
*  Appeals to review her conviction. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=966.86s)]
*  And last year, the all Republican court agreed to the review. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=968.9399999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is Crystal Mason, the Texas woman who is appealing her five year [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=972.9399999999999s)]
*  prison sentence for casting a provisional ballot in the 2016 election. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=976.78s)]
*  Crystal Mason, thank you so much for joining us on the show tonight. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=981.46s)]
*  We know that Mark Meadows is being investigated. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=984.74s)]
*  We know that Mark Meadows is being investigated for voter fraud. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=987.66s)]
*  The former Trump White House chief of staff, I mentioned a bunch of other men [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=990.18s)]
*  who were investigated, charged, found guilty, pled guilty, and they didn't [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=993.54s)]
*  really get any prison time or prison sentences. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=997.8199999999999s)]
*  And then this happened to you. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1000.9399999999999s)]
*  The outcome for them so different to your outcome. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1002.18s)]
*  What do you make of it all? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1005.1s)]
*  This really saddens me, saddens me on what type of justice system we have here today. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1007.9399999999999s)]
*  Obviously, it shows that I was pretty much target. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1013.9s)]
*  And right now, five years later, go ahead. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1020.54s)]
*  No, I was just wondering if you think it's I'm going to ask. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1025.66s)]
*  I'm just going to ask the question straight up. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1028.18s)]
*  Do you think it's because they're white men and you're a black woman? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1029.78s)]
*  Of course, of course, you can see plain as day that it is. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1033.9s)]
*  It's a it's a different system. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1040.06s)]
*  It's a different system. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1042.86s)]
*  It is indeed. And I wonder what is happening in terms of [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1046.22s)]
*  the system that you're dealing with right now? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1050.26s)]
*  What is the latest on your fight to get your conviction overturned? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1052.3000000000002s)]
*  We know that last year, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals agreed to review your case. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1055.46s)]
*  They're going to rely on legal briefs rather than oral arguments. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1060.14s)]
*  What can you tell us about what you've heard from them? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1063.42s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1065.46s)]
*  Well, right now, five years later, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1068.26s)]
*  I've been out on a pill for five years fighting to stay free. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1071.3000000000002s)]
*  And I'm at the criminal courts of appeal. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1074.74s)]
*  And just imagine waking up every Wednesday to see if you stay free [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1078.3s)]
*  or if you go to prison. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1083.82s)]
*  It's overwhelming for me and my family. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1085.66s)]
*  I think we lost you for a moment there, Crystal. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1089.26s)]
*  Let me let me ask you this before we run out of time very quickly. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1091.06s)]
*  Does it worry you that if someone can so easily make an innocent mistake [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1094.14s)]
*  at the polls as you did and be sent to jail for five years, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1097.9s)]
*  while other people are deliberately carrying out fraud and nothing's happening to them, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1100.5s)]
*  people like yourself, people who look like you from backgrounds like yourself, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1104.7s)]
*  who might be not not be obviously Republican voters, as some of these guys [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1108.46s)]
*  were that I mentioned, they're going to be intimidated into not voting. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1112.06s)]
*  They're going to say, well, it's not worth the hassle to go out and vote. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1115.7s)]
*  And maybe that's the goal of all this. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1117.82s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1120.94s)]
*  I feel like the goal is to scare the black and the brown away from the poll. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1122.58s)]
*  And if you look at the cases, you can kind of see [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1126.3s)]
*  from little to no consequences at all on true real voter fraud cases. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1129.94s)]
*  And yet I filled out a provision about it and never counted. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1135.6200000000001s)]
*  And I'm sentenced to five years for illegally voting, but never voting. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1139.46s)]
*  Crystal Mason, we appreciate your time tonight. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1148.06s)]
*  We wish you well with your appeal against your sentence for costing [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1150.42s)]
*  a provisional ballot in the 2016 election. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1153.14s)]
*  Thank you for coming on the show tonight. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1155.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUAP58PKWb0&t=1158.26s)]
