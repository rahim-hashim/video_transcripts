# Trump's federal demolition failing on multiple fronts as courts step in, public opinion turns
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ)
*  Meanwhile, this is what it looked like in Washington, D.C., today, as workers from that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=0.0s)]
*  agency, from USAID, were each given a grand total of 15 minutes by the Trump administration [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=5.68s)]
*  to come into USAID headquarters and retrieve their belongings from their offices. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=11.56s)]
*  While they were doing that, people showed up in big numbers to support them and clap [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=17.6s)]
*  for them and to say thank you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=21.8s)]
*  There are so many emotions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=23.92s)]
*  I already cried this morning when I arrived. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=36.08s)]
*  Someone said, you know, thanks for being here, and I just burst into tears. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=40.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  We're here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  We thank you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  This is not happening in the dark. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  That was Washington, D.C., today, as people showed up to support and thank USAID workers, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=47.76s)]
*  who the Trump administration is trying to fire as they try to shut down that agency, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=62.8s)]
*  even though they pretty clearly are just legally not allowed to do that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=67.96s)]
*  turning out to protest, but also support the people who are at the sharp end of this [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=73.68s)]
*  stick. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=78.64s)]
*  One of the tools the Trump administration has been using to try to destroy USAID and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=80.2s)]
*  to disassemble so many other agencies is wholesale firing, en masse firing, everybody who's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=84.84s)]
*  considered a probationary employee. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=92.4s)]
*  And you've heard that term over this last couple of weeks when they have been using [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  this as the basis for firing people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=99.44000000000001s)]
*  Being a probationary employee, it usually means you're in your first year or two on [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=101.76s)]
*  the job. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=106.28s)]
*  It can also mean that you've transferred into a new job or you've been promoted within [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=107.48s)]
*  the last year or two. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=111.96s)]
*  Probationary makes it sound like you've been in trouble, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=114.0s)]
*  And you're like, you're on probation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=116.16s)]
*  We're watching you because you did something wrong. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=118.12s)]
*  It's not that at all. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=120.08s)]
*  It is a meaningless category in terms of the importance of the work that's being done by [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=121.08s)]
*  that employee, their skill level, their performance, their value to the government and to their [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=125.8s)]
*  agency. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=131.04s)]
*  But nevertheless, the Trump administration has ordered mass firings of people based purely [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=132.04s)]
*  on that classification just because they thought it would be easy to get away with that, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=136.64s)]
*  legally speaking. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=141.12s)]
*  Turns out not so fast. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=143.04s)]
*  Tonight, a federal judge on the West Coast, a federal judge in California, has just ruled [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=145.72s)]
*  that the Trump administration's instructions to agencies about indiscriminately firing [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=150.92s)]
*  all these people, thousands and thousands of probationary employees thus far. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  A judge just ruled tonight that the instruction from the Trump administration to all the agencies [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  about firing these people is, quote, illegal and, quote, should be stopped, rescinded. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=165.88s)]
*  Federal Judge William Alsop said from the bench in his ruling tonight, quote, the Office [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=174.0s)]
*  of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever under any statute in [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=177.54s)]
*  the history of the universe to hire and fire employees within another agency. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=183.16s)]
*  He said, quote, it can hire its own employees, yes, can fire them, but it cannot order or [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=188.6s)]
*  direct some other agency to do so. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=193.44s)]
*  Judge Alsop further ordered tonight from the bench that the rescinding of the Trump administration [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=197.2s)]
*  directive to fire probationary employees, he ordered that the rescinding of that directive [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=205.56s)]
*  should be conveyed tonight to the Pentagon, to the U.S. Defense Department. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=212.44s)]
*  And I think that's because tomorrow is the day on which the Pentagon was otherwise expected [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=219.0s)]
*  to march more than 5,000 fired employees out the door. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=222.68s)]
*  Well, again, the judge said the Defense Department needs to be informed of my ruling tonight, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=227.6s)]
*  not tomorrow, tonight. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  So whether or not they still try to fire those 5,000-plus employees tomorrow at Defense [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=237.6s)]
*  Department, it may not happen because of this judge's order. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  We shall see. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  We don't think that this order from this judge tonight means that all the other probationary [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=248.56s)]
*  employees who have already been fired are going to be reinstated. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=252.18s)]
*  We don't think that's the implication of this ruling, but we're going to have to wait [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=255.0s)]
*  to see his written order in this case, which we expect tomorrow. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=258.74s)]
*  Again, he ruled from the bench tonight. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=261.64s)]
*  He ordered that his ruling from the bench be conveyed to the Pentagon. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=263.24s)]
*  But we expect his written ruling tomorrow. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFuRisqp8fQ&t=267.02s)]
