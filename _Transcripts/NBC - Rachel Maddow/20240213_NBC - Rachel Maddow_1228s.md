# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 12
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU)
*  A three-judge panel of the Federal Appeals Court in Washington, D.C., released a unanimous [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=0.0s)]
*  opinion last week saying that Donald Trump is not immune from criminal prosecution for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=4.68s)]
*  his attempt to stay in power after he lost reelection. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=9.48s)]
*  And when they issued that ruling, they also tried to box him in to what he could do next. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=13.24s)]
*  They tried to box him into appealing straight to the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=17.68s)]
*  They said, the way they ruled, they said that if Trump tried to come back to that same appeals [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=21.28s)]
*  court, if he tried to make that same court take another turn with that same case, Trump [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=26.48s)]
*  would risk the whole process speeding up, which is the last thing he wants. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=31.44s)]
*  They said if he came back to the appeals court instead of just going straight to the Supremes, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  his trial on this issue would effectively be unfrozen. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  It would get put back on the calendar. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=44.24s)]
*  All systems go. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=45.96s)]
*  He might end up in court sooner than he wants to. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=47.0s)]
*  Well, today, Donald Trump did go to the Supreme Court, but he asked them to overrule that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=50.68s)]
*  part of the appeals court ruling where they were trying to get him to speed up the process. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=57.72s)]
*  He's asking the Supreme Court to allow him additional review from that same appeals court. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  He wants to be able to go to all 11 judges on that D.C. appeals court instead of just [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=68.64s)]
*  the three-judge panel that gave him the ruling thus far. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=73.8s)]
*  And he wants to be able to do that before he appeals to the Supreme Court without risking [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=76.8s)]
*  his trial starting up as punishment. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=81.2s)]
*  He argued in his filing with the court tonight that this court should stay this unprecedented [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=84.28s)]
*  and unacceptable departure from ordinary appellate procedures and allow President Trump's claim [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=90.56s)]
*  of immunity to be decided in the ordinary course of justice. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=95.92s)]
*  This presumably, this filing tonight from Trump and his lawyers seems to be their way [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=101.16s)]
*  of trying kind of a bank shot. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=106.11999999999999s)]
*  They're they're insisting that he should get yet more review in the appeals court in [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=107.44s)]
*  D.C. before he inevitably appeals to the United States Supreme Court. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=111.44s)]
*  He's always playing for more delay, always playing for more procedure, always playing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  for more time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=121.0s)]
*  Well, how strong is this play? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  How strong is his case for this? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  And if the Supreme Court does grant him what he's asking, what would that mean for the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=126.83999999999999s)]
*  timing of his big federal criminal trial for trying to stay in office after he was voted [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=130.0s)]
*  out? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=134.76s)]
*  Joining us now is Chuck Rosenberg, former U.S. attorney, senior FBI official. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=136.32s)]
*  Chuck, it's great to see you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here tonight. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  My pleasure, Rachel. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=142.56s)]
*  Did I explain the basics of that correctly, that he is trying to effectively get the Supreme [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  Court to take away that rushing tactic, that tactic by which the appeals court was trying [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=150.04s)]
*  to tell him you got to end this appeals process at some point and get to trial? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  Good description. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  So, I'll start conceptually this way. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=163.96s)]
*  Three-step ladder. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=164.96s)]
*  You know, step one would be the trial court. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=165.96s)]
*  That's where the prosecutors want to be. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=168.4s)]
*  That's where a jury would be seated, the trial would be conducted and the verdict rendered. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=169.8s)]
*  Prosecutors want to be there, and Mr. Trump does not. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  Step two on that ladder would be the appellate court, where he recently lost unanimously [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=178.36s)]
*  on his claim of absolute immunity. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  And what he'd like to do now is either be on wrong number three, step three, the Supreme [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=184.94000000000003s)]
*  Court, or back in the appellate court. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=189.84s)]
*  But by all means, Rachel, to avoid step one, the trial court. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=192.2s)]
*  So this week is going to be kind of nuts. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=197.16s)]
*  I think we can all agree. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=200.39999999999998s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump started the week today at a courthouse in Florida, a federal [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=202.72s)]
*  courthouse, for a hearing in the federal criminal case against him related to his allegedly [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=206.92s)]
*  hiding classified documents at his Florida golf club and refusing to turn them over when [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  he was asked for them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  That's how his week started in the federal court in Florida. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=219.4s)]
*  His week could end with a New York judge ousting him from running his family business and ordering [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=222.72s)]
*  him to pay hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=227.8s)]
*  That's the punishment New York's attorney general is asking for in her fraud case against [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=230.32s)]
*  Trump and the Trump Organization. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=234.72s)]
*  The New York Times reports today that the judge in that fraud case is expected to issue [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=236.56s)]
*  his verdict on Friday of this week. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=240.88s)]
*  Again, that is just New York Times reporting. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=243.56s)]
*  We have not confirmed that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=245.36s)]
*  But we're watching that as well, Judge, and Gorin could rule whenever he feels like it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=247.38s)]
*  Friday is also the deadline for Trump to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to try to get the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=252.54s)]
*  justices to throw out lawsuits against him from Capitol Police officers who were injured [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=257.74s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=262.42s)]
*  On Thursday in New York, there will be a pivotal hearing in the Hush Money criminal case, in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=265.06s)]
*  which the judge is expected to officially schedule the start of that New York state [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=270.58s)]
*  criminal trial. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=275.02s)]
*  That trial could start as soon as next month. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=276.02s)]
*  That could be the first criminal trial that Trump is actually in the courtroom for. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=278.53999999999996s)]
*  Also on Thursday, Georgia prosecutor Fannie Willis will be appearing at a hearing about [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=283.74s)]
*  whether or not she should be disqualified from her RICO case against Donald Trump in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=287.82s)]
*  Georgia. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=293.06s)]
*  Trump and some of his 14 co-defendants in Fannie Willis' case in Georgia argue that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=294.06s)]
*  she should be disqualified because she and one of the top prosecutors she hired for the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=298.85999999999996s)]
*  case are involved in a personal romantic relationship. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=303.02s)]
*  Now, Fannie Willis has argued that nothing about that personal relationship is disqualifying. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=306.7s)]
*  She's argued that Trump and his co-defendants are just using these allegations essentially [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=311.94s)]
*  as salacious distractions to try to muddy the waters and scuttle the case against them [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=316.14s)]
*  by creating a lot of public relations nonsense about this issue that has no legal consequence. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=322.74s)]
*  That said, there was a hearing today on these allegations and the judge in this case in [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=329.22s)]
*  Georgia said that these allegations against District Attorney Willis could result in Willis [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=333.42s)]
*  being disqualified from the case. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=339.22s)]
*  And as such, he said he definitely wants to hear evidence on these allegations on Thursday [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  of this week. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=346.1s)]
*  So it all makes for a very, very busy week in terms of the legal part of our political [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=348.26000000000005s)]
*  news now. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=352.58000000000004s)]
*  But it also puts District Attorney Fannie Willis in quite a spot. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=354.12s)]
*  Regardless of what you or anybody else might think about Willis's personal relationship [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=357.9s)]
*  with this prosecutor and whether she did anything legally wrong here, the only person whose [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=361.94s)]
*  opinion really matters on that right now is the judge. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=368.14s)]
*  And today in court, he did make clear, he did say explicitly that he thinks she might [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=371.22s)]
*  be disqualified from this case because of these allegations. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=375.94s)]
*  Now the key dynamic at work around this is that if Fannie Willis is disqualified, fairly [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=380.46s)]
*  or unfairly, her whole office, the whole District Attorney's office is disqualified [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=386.26s)]
*  from working on that case, which would mean in all likelihood that whole case would go [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  away. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=396.38s)]
*  And that is why Georgia State University law professor Clark Cunningham argued in The New [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=398.8s)]
*  York Times last month that the best thing Fannie Willis could do to protect her case [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=402.82s)]
*  against Trump and his RICO defendants in Georgia would be for her to take a leave of absence, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=407.02s)]
*  for her to take a personal leave of absence from the District Attorney's office to turn [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=413.18s)]
*  over the case to a Deputy District Attorney that would end these proceedings against her [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=417.66s)]
*  effectively and it would leave her office in charge of the case and the case could still [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=422.66s)]
*  go forward. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=426.68s)]
*  We contacted Professor Cunningham about this today, these new developments. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=428.26s)]
*  He told us, quote, this action, meaning a personal leave by District Attorney Willis, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=431.62s)]
*  should be looked at strategically as the best option she has to make this enormously distracting [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=437.06s)]
*  controversy go away and to put the case back on track, still in the control of the Fulton [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=441.98s)]
*  County DA's office. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=447.34000000000003s)]
*  If Judge McAfee grants any of the motions to disqualify Willis at the hearing Thursday [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=449.1s)]
*  this week, then her option to take leave probably disappears at that point. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=454.06s)]
*  Now I should also mention The Washington Post is reporting tonight that Trump plans to attend [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=461.38s)]
*  that Thursday hearing in Georgia so he can be there in the courtroom as the details of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=466.18s)]
*  this personal relationship between Fonny Willis and this other prosecutor are laid [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=471.7s)]
*  out in open court. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=475.5s)]
*  That should make it all the more of a circus. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=476.7s)]
*  There will also, I believe, be cameras in that court proceeding. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=478.97999999999996s)]
*  Don't quote me on that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=482.97999999999996s)]
*  But of course, Trump would like to be there regardless. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=483.98s)]
*  Thursday night, a new interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin with a former Fox [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=488.65999999999997s)]
*  News host was posted online. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=493.46s)]
*  You might have read that it started with Putin giving a long, inexplicable and boring history [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=496.7s)]
*  lecture that went on and on and on and on and didn't seem to have a point and that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=500.94s)]
*  definitely lost most of its American audience. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=504.42s)]
*  True, all true. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=507.02s)]
*  Except for the part of the history lecture where Putin got to 1939, at which point he [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=510.42s)]
*  then claimed in this interview that it was Poland who started World War II. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=516.5s)]
*  Poland did it because even though Poland had cooperated with Hitler up to a point, they [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=521.86s)]
*  They stopped cooperating with Hitler when Hitler really wanted them to cooperate more. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=526.14s)]
*  And once that happened, Hitler had no choice. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=531.1s)]
*  He just had to invade. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=533.06s)]
*  And by the way, it was kind of doing Poland a favor. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=534.54s)]
*  Exact same line. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=539.42s)]
*  We haven't had someone trying to sell this line to an American audience since it happened [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=540.42s)]
*  the first time in 1939. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=545.3s)]
*  With Philip Johnson's quote unquote reporting, right? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=548.38s)]
*  And with him, we had a committed American fascist allied with the Nazis, openly rooting [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=553.1s)]
*  for them, trying to sell us this bill of goods. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=557.22s)]
*  That happened in 1939. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=559.5s)]
*  It hasn't happened since until now. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=560.66s)]
*  And the reason Putin is trying to sell us the American public this bizarre line now [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=564.0s)]
*  is more worrying than it is interesting. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=571.3000000000001s)]
*  It might be boring, but it is worrying. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=575.66s)]
*  Here's Russian journalist Masha Gessen explaining it for an American audience in The New Yorker [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=579.46s)]
*  in a piece that I really highly recommend that you take a look at if you can in The [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=585.14s)]
*  New Yorker. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=588.74s)]
*  Gessen says this quote, I can't get one passage out of my mind. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=589.74s)]
*  In the history lecture portion of the interview, when Putin got to 1939, he said Poland cooperated [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=594.4200000000001s)]
*  with Germany, but then it refused to comply with Hitler's demands. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=599.52s)]
*  Poles forced him. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=603.38s)]
*  They overplayed their hand and they forced Hitler to start the Second World War by attacking [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=604.52s)]
*  The idea, Gessen says, that the idea that the victim of the attack serves as its instigator [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=610.22s)]
*  by forcing the hand of the aggressor, that is central to all of Putin's explanations [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=617.7800000000001s)]
*  for Russia's war in Ukraine. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=621.62s)]
*  Gessen says, though, to my knowledge, this is the first time Putin described Hitler's [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=623.5s)]
*  aggression in these same terms. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=627.72s)]
*  Quote, the way Putin described the beginning of the Second World War in this interview [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=629.9s)]
*  suggests that in his mind, he might see himself as Hitler, but perhaps a while year one, one [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=633.9s)]
*  who can make inroads into the United States and create an alliance with its presumed future [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=640.14s)]
*  president. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=645.5s)]
*  It's telling too, Gessen continues, that Putin took the time to accuse Poland of both [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=646.5s)]
*  allying with Nazi Germany and inciting Hitler's aggression. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=651.5s)]
*  As he has done with Ukraine in the past, he's positioning Poland as the heir to Nazism. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=656.04s)]
*  Putin mentioned Poland more than 30 times in this conversation with Mr. Carlson. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=661.78s)]
*  If I were Poland, I'd be scared. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=666.98s)]
*  End quote. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=670.9399999999999s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is selling a new line to Americans. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=672.6999999999999s)]
*  He's saying that Poland is the real aggressor that we should blame for World War II. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=678.98s)]
*  And he's starting to use the same language, starting to cite the same weird reasons he [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=686.02s)]
*  to justify invading Ukraine when he talks about Poland. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=690.1s)]
*  And what's really, really important to understand about that is that Poland is a NATO country. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=695.38s)]
*  They have been for 25 years now. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=699.62s)]
*  And we're a NATO country too. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=702.1s)]
*  And if Putin decides that he doesn't just want to invade Ukraine, which he's done twice [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=704.1s)]
*  now since 2014, and he doesn't just want to invade Georgia and Moldova as well, which [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=709.86s)]
*  he has also invaded, if he decides, as he is sort of threatening here, if he decides that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=714.58s)]
*  he's going to start shooting at Poland now too, or trying to take land in Poland, that [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=719.06s)]
*  would be Putin and Russia attacking NATO, which would oblige the other 30 NATO countries [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=722.9799999999999s)]
*  in the world, including us, to come to their rescue against Russia. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=730.5799999999999s)]
*  Or maybe not. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=737.6199999999999s)]
*  Less than 48 hours after that interview posted online, former President Donald Trump, at [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=740.2199999999999s)]
*  a rally, said if he's president again, basically he would not honor that commitment. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=746.34s)]
*  He appears to have made up a conversation with what he called the leader of a, quote, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=751.22s)]
*  large NATO country, in which he says he told this leader that if that country were attacked [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=755.14s)]
*  by Russia, quote, no, I would not protect you. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=759.86s)]
*  He said, quote, in fact, I would encourage them, meaning Russia, to do whatever the hell [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=762.74s)]
*  they want. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=767.94s)]
*  As David Sanger wrote in the New York Times today, quote, the larger implication of his [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=771.3000000000001s)]
*  statement is that he, Trump, might invite President Vladimir Putin of Russia to pick [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=774.66s)]
*  off a NATO nation as a warning and a lesson to the 30 or so others in NATO about heeding [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=779.62s)]
*  Mr. Trump's demands. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=786.6999999999999s)]
*  I have to stress here that Trump really did use the word encourage. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=788.6999999999999s)]
*  He did not say that the United States would sit idly by in case Russia invaded a NATO [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=794.2199999999999s)]
*  ally. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=799.74s)]
*  He said he would encourage Russia to go after one of our allies. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=800.82s)]
*  He would encourage them. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=804.94s)]
*  In other words, he would tell Russia to go take out one of our allies with the assurance [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=807.78s)]
*  that we'd do nothing to help. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=811.22s)]
*  This is happening within 48 hours of Putin telling a handpicked interviewer which countries [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=813.58s)]
*  he thinks really have had it coming. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=818.3s)]
*  And he's got one of them in NATO at the top of his list. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=821.46s)]
*  But don't forget, President Biden is three years older than that guy, so obviously there's [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=827.34s)]
*  equally enormous risk in picking either of these candidates to be president of the United [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=831.3000000000001s)]
*  States. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=834.98s)]
*  One is obviously old. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=835.98s)]
*  One is also old and facing 91 felony charges and saying he will literally encourage Russia [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=837.38s)]
*  to expand its war to hit our allies, while Russia's dictator is signaling to an American [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=843.4200000000001s)]
*  audience that he plans to do just that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=848.82s)]
*  Lots of other countries. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=855.5s)]
*  I'm sad to say it, but lots of other countries have to deal with former presidents and prime [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=856.78s)]
*  ministers facing criminal charges. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=862.02s)]
*  It is awful and complicated and fraught, and nobody in this country wishes that we had [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=863.86s)]
*  to deal with that, but now we do. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=868.66s)]
*  That said, take comfort in the fact that lots of other countries have had to deal with that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=871.5799999999999s)]
*  one way or another. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=875.1s)]
*  Maybe we can learn something from the lessons of how they've done it well or poorly. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=876.1s)]
*  Lots of other countries have had to deal with criminal charges against leaders and would-be [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=880.42s)]
*  return leaders. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=884.26s)]
*  But nobody is dealing with a would-be return president telling a dictator who's just invaded [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=885.74s)]
*  one of our allies to please go on and invade another. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=891.0600000000001s)]
*  Pick one, go on, do it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=894.82s)]
*  For that one, that's us alone. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=898.46s)]
*  Joining us now is former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=900.86s)]
*  Ambassador McFaul was recently in Lithuania where he had the opportunity to speak with [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=904.1800000000001s)]
*  some of that country's leaders. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=906.98s)]
*  It has a little bit of insight into how this may be playing in our allies who are very [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=908.34s)]
*  much at the pointy end of the spear here in discussions like this. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=912.98s)]
*  Ambassador McFaul, it's great to see you. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=917.94s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=919.26s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=921.0600000000001s)]
*  Let me first ask you if you feel like any of the reaction to what President Trump said [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=923.34s)]
*  this weekend, the interpretation of what it means, its implications, if you feel like [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=928.9s)]
*  any of it's being misconstrued, or you feel like people are getting it the wrong way around, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=934.4200000000001s)]
*  or do you feel like this is getting the right kind of response? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=938.78s)]
*  I'm shocked by how muted the response is. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=943.8199999999999s)]
*  You said it several times tonight, Rachel. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=945.86s)]
*  It is just completely shocking what he said. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=948.6999999999999s)]
*  And the fact that we're not all, thank you, by the way, for devoting so much time in your [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=953.62s)]
*  program tonight on it, and thank you for making the connections to the 1930s, because this [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=957.8199999999999s)]
*  is a 1930s vibe. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=964.4599999999999s)]
*  And when I was in Lithuania meeting with leaders, not just from Lithuania, but Poland, Latvia, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=966.72s)]
*  that's the metaphor they're using and talking about these terms. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=972.2199999999999s)]
*  What's shocking to me is that we're not all not shocked by it. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=976.02s)]
*  We've become so used to Mr. Trump saying these outrageous things. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=979.0999999999999s)]
*  And then it's just, oh, that's just Trump being Trump. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=983.3399999999999s)]
*  But the fact that he said Russia, Putin should invade one of our allies and he would encourage [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=986.4s)]
*  it, it's just outrageous, extraordinary. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=992.9s)]
*  So that's the reaction that I think is strange to me, that there's not more people saying [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=996.68s)]
*  that, especially national security officials, former officials in the Republican Party, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1001.7s)]
*  because I know that they agree with me. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1008.1s)]
*  And I'm shocked that they're so silent tonight. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1010.54s)]
*  In Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, in Poland, in those countries, is there a sense that [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1014.26s)]
*  this is more than just uncouth, that this is something that there's a real threat here [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1021.26s)]
*  that Putin is actually sort of testing whether or not he can cross yet another border, that [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1027.7s)]
*  he can start military action against yet another country? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1034.7s)]
*  Without question. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1040.54s)]
*  Publicly, leaders from those countries have said it, behind closed doors, they say it [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1041.54s)]
*  with even more emotion in their voice. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1046.6599999999999s)]
*  And here's the scenario they worry about. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1049.96s)]
*  Right now, Russia is stuck fighting a difficult, stalemated war in Ukraine. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1053.06s)]
*  Thank goodness that they haven't achieved greater objectives. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1058.18s)]
*  And we need to help them, the Ukrainians, so that they don't. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1061.5s)]
*  But they worry what happens two years from now, three years from now, four years from [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1065.18s)]
*  now, when Russia has greater capability and we, because Mr. Trump comes to power, are [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1069.46s)]
*  no longer interested in defending our NATO allies. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1076.3799999999999s)]
*  And they talk very openly about what will we have to do if the United States is not [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1080.02s)]
*  there to help us. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1085.22s)]
*  They talk very openly about how the Soviet Union was weak in 1941 when Hitler invaded, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1086.46s)]
*  but came back roaring in 1943, 44, 45. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1093.26s)]
*  And they talk very explicitly about will the United States recognize the Article 5 commitment [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1097.58s)]
*  that we have in NATO to defend them? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1103.74s)]
*  And if we don't, which coalition of countries will have to do it on their own? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1106.38s)]
*  Now, I hope they're wrong. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1110.5400000000002s)]
*  And I think it's important to understand and underscore that so far, Russia and the Soviet [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1112.2600000000002s)]
*  Union has never attacked a NATO country. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1117.18s)]
*  That's the good news. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1120.0200000000002s)]
*  But the fact that they're having these conversations is deeply troubling, exacerbated then by what [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1121.22s)]
*  Mr. Trump just said a few days ago. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1127.22s)]
*  And I mean, some of the response has been sort of leavened on the Republican side. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1130.74s)]
*  And I'm thinking principally here about Senator Marco Rubio, but also some other Republicans [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1136.74s)]
*  who have said, hey, listen, you know, we passed a law that says the Senate has to give permission [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1142.5s)]
*  if a president ever wants to get us out of NATO in the future. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1148.1s)]
*  You know, this is, like you said, Trump just being Trump, this isn't a real risk. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1152.5s)]
*  I feel like that may be true on paper, but the risk is that the green light is given [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1157.02s)]
*  once an American commitment is questioned on American soil by a would-be American leader. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1165.7s)]
*  That legally it doesn't necessarily matter that the green light has been given, that [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1172.94s)]
*  the signal has been given, that the security umbrella has been removed, regardless of, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1176.7s)]
*  legalistically, whatever happens as a consequence of Trump's remarks. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1181.98s)]
*  Is that a fair assessment? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1185.1799999999998s)]
*  That's exactly right, Rachel, which is to say, yeah, the law is there. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1186.46s)]
*  We're not going to withdraw from NATO. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1191.1s)]
*  But if a NATO country is attacked, especially if it's an ambiguous attack, right, not tanks [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1192.74s)]
*  rolling to Tallinn, but something strange, and then Trump says, I don't care because [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1198.34s)]
*  they didn't pay us, that's when NATO begins to crumble with or without that law in place. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkxf9M9QwU&t=1202.7s)]
