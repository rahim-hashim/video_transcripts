# 'Absurd and shameful executive orders': Eric Holder calls on law firms to unify against Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ)
*  Joining us once again is former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Attorney General, thank you so much for being here again. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=3.84s)]
*  Last night, President Trump ordered the Justice Department, in a bizarre executive order, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=7.28s)]
*  he ordered DOJ to investigate two named people who served in his administration during his [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=12.620000000000001s)]
*  first term in office. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=18.54s)]
*  Each of them had criticized or contradicted him publicly. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  This is one of the anti-democratic bright red lines that I've been waiting for the Trump [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=24.52s)]
*  administration to cross. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=29.58s)]
*  The president ordering his prosecutors to go after named people who displease him, like, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=31.779999999999998s)]
*  were there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=37.739999999999995s)]
*  What do you think the response should be now that this has happened? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=38.94s)]
*  Well, in some ways, this is the most disturbing of the executive orders that he has signed. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=42.58s)]
*  Everybody needs to understand executive orders do not have the power of law, and yet they [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=47.78s)]
*  can move parts of the executive branch. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=52.16s)]
*  I would hope that lawyers, I assume that they have lawyers, will be as creative and as aggressive [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=55.739999999999995s)]
*  as they possibly can to forestall any investigation that might be taken. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=60.779999999999994s)]
*  That might be a difficult thing to do. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=65.02s)]
*  I'll have to look actually at what the terms are of the executive order. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=67.66s)]
*  It may state a reason. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=72.3s)]
*  I have not seen it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=73.3s)]
*  It may state a specific reason. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=74.3s)]
*  He's not been shy in putting into his executive orders exactly why he is ordering these things. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=75.69999999999999s)]
*  And if he's ordering that it be done because they were, in essence, critics of the policies [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=81.06s)]
*  that he had in place in his first administration, that might serve as a basis for trying to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=86.3s)]
*  forestall any action by the Justice Department pursuant to the orders of the president. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=91.78s)]
*  But this is a time, I think, to be aggressive in pushing back as much as is possible against [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=97.62s)]
*  these really absurd and shameful executive orders. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=102.7s)]
*  I'm thinking about putting together that kind of aggressive legal defense that gets [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=107.82s)]
*  us right to the question of what's been happening with the president's efforts to, I think, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=110.74s)]
*  shockingly successful efforts to intimidate law firms. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=116.58s)]
*  We've talked about this a little bit. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=120.13999999999999s)]
*  I mentioned that your firm, Coveted in Burling, was the first firm to be targeted by Trump. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=121.78s)]
*  I know that your firm has signed a brief in support of another firm that is targeted by [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=128.18s)]
*  the president and that's fighting the executive order in court. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=132.62s)]
*  But just tonight, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that four more big firms are [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=136.62s)]
*  nearing deals with Trump where they're going to do tens of millions of dollars' worth [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=141.26s)]
*  of pro-bono work for causes that he chooses, all in an effort to sort of appease him and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=145.74s)]
*  keep him from criticizing them or targeting them. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=152.66s)]
*  You said that you've been disappointed in the way law firms have responded here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=156.74s)]
*  What do you think the right response would be from law firms, from big law partners, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=160.46s)]
*  when these threats started coming down the pike? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=166.34s)]
*  What should they do now, even though so many of them have already signed these deals? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=167.46s)]
*  Well, I think, first off, the profession should have stuck together and said, rejected all [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=171.86s)]
*  of the attempts to go after them in the way that he has done, reject all of these executive [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=178.42000000000002s)]
*  orders and go to court and sue, as some have. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=183.88s)]
*  If we had stuck together, if we had all stuck together, these facially invalid, clearly [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=187.18s)]
*  unconstitutional orders would have had no impact on the profession and would have allowed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=192.42s)]
*  the profession to proceed in the way that I expect that it would. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=197.22s)]
*  It's unfortunate that some have decided to cut deals with the administration, some even [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=201.33999999999997s)]
*  before they were the targets of executive orders. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  And I think that, you know, they're going to, you know, some pledge $40 million, $100 [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=211.14s)]
*  million, whatever it is, that he can help determine how the money is to be used for [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=216.22s)]
*  so-called pro bono activities. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  And I saw today he was talking about getting these law firms to help him negotiate trade [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=221.82000000000002s)]
*  deals or work on this whole tariff controversy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=226.74s)]
*  I'm not sure that they anticipated that, but that's what happens when you make deals with [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=230.9s)]
*  people like the president. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=235.3s)]
*  You can't really tell exactly how you're going to be used. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=237.86s)]
*  And so I would hope that people, that firms would consider their obligations, stand fast, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=242.1s)]
*  understand that if you sue, if you sue, you're likely to win and that you will not suffer [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=251.45999999999998s)]
*  any consequence as a result of your opposition. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=257.1s)]
*  Now, it also means that other firms should not be trying to poach clients of firms that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=260.42s)]
*  are the recipients of these executive orders, should not be trying to poach lawyers of the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=266.18s)]
*  firms that receive these executive orders. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=271.14s)]
*  The profession, these firms need to stand together. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  If we do, I think we ultimately win. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=277.86s)]
*  And for those who make these deals, what are you going to say five years from now when [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=280.7s)]
*  this is over? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=285.86s)]
*  And when you start to talk about all the great culture that you have, the commitment that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  you have to the rule of law, how you're willing to take chances to take on unpopular clients, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=291.86s)]
*  how are you going to say that with a straight face? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=298.18s)]
*  How are you going to recruit young lawyers to come join you in what you say is the noble [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=300.38s)]
*  quest of the legal profession? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=305.34s)]
*  These are all the kinds of things that are to go into the calculus that these firms make [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  when they're trying to determine how they're going to react to executive orders that are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=313.98s)]
*  either put against them or threatened to be put against them. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=317.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=321.21999999999997s)]
*  What the legal profession, as a non-lawyer looking from the outside, what the legal profession [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  has needed here plainly is leadership. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=327.24s)]
*  I think with those words, you're providing some important leadership here tonight. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  Former Attorney General Eric Holder, it's an honor to have you here tonight, sir. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=335.6s)]
*  Come back any time. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=338.32s)]
*  We'd love to have you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=339.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=340.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeFum9ywIQ&t=341.32s)]
