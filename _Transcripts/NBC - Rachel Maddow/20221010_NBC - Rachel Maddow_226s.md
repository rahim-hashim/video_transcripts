# Maddow: Defending Democracy Calls For A Whole-Of-Society Response
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs)
*  The story of this forgotten senator, William Langer, and the accused seditionists he so [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=0.0s)]
*  loudly supported in Washington, that is part of my new podcast that just launched today. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=7.92s)]
*  It's the story of members of Congress who are implicated in just some terrible stuff, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=14.76s)]
*  senators and members of the House both. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  And when the Justice Department tried to act in the courts, when the Justice Department [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=22.16s)]
*  pursued an investigation and brought a criminal prosecution of people who were involved in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=26.0s)]
*  plots to violently overthrow the government, these members of Congress sprung into action [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=30.28s)]
*  to save themselves and derail the investigation into these threats, to throw out the results [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=36.54s)]
*  of a presidential election, to violently overthrow the U.S. government, to have an authoritarian [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=41.96s)]
*  government here instead of a democracy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=46.24s)]
*  It all happened. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=50.28s)]
*  I mean, January 6, 2021 was really something. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=52.24s)]
*  And the members of Congress who were tied up in it and the sedition trials that have [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=56.24s)]
*  just started this month for these pro-Trump paramilitary groups who were part of it, it's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=60.44s)]
*  an amazing thing that we are going through as a country right now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=64.72s)]
*  But this is not the first time we have been through something along these lines. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  And I can tell you, spending all these months working on this project, working on this story, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=73.76s)]
*  I don't think it's a spoiler to tell you that one of the main takeaways for us, at least [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=78.28s)]
*  one of the main takeaways for me, looking at what happened last time that we were up [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=84.36s)]
*  against something like this, is that the criminal law can't do everything. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=87.88s)]
*  I mean, we can't ever count on it all being settled in the courtroom. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  When the country is up against rising authoritarianism and election denialism and extremist ultra-right [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=99.64s)]
*  groups that are willing to use violence against everyone else to get their way, those are [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=105.76s)]
*  crimes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=109.92s)]
*  And there definitely is a role for the courts and for the prison system, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=110.92s)]
*  But there's also a really important role for everything else, for a whole-of-society [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  response. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=119.48s)]
*  I mean, the criminal justice system isn't bulletproof, but it also doesn't address the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=120.48s)]
*  nature of those crimes in their totality. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  And so in order to effectively combat fascism, in order to effectively combat rising authoritarianism, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=130.04s)]
*  particularly when it comes to trying to undo elections and trying to have power be both [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=137.0s)]
*  achieved and maintained in this country by some means other than democracy, when it comes [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=143.38s)]
*  to threatening force as the way of seizing power here, there is not only room, there [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  is a necessity for a whole-of-society response, for everybody to do something, for activism, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=153.28s)]
*  for journalism, for political organizing, to keep those folks away from real power. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=159.96s)]
*  Anyway, like I said, I see a way in which you learn that we've been through something [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  like this before, and that can be enervating, that can be draining. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=174.12s)]
*  God, like, are we ever going to get away from this? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=177.24s)]
*  On the other hand, knowing that we faced it before, and we've effectively faced it before, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=179.32s)]
*  and there have been Americans before us who had great ideas about how to outflank and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=183.88s)]
*  defeat those forces, that to me is energizing and interesting. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=187.36s)]
*  And it's a story I've been desperate to tell for months now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  I have been working on this for months, and it's out today. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=195.72000000000003s)]
*  It's free. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  You can get it anywhere. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  You get your podcasts. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  The title is Rachel Maddow Presents Ultra. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmO3UXD9pQs&t=201.64000000000001s)]
