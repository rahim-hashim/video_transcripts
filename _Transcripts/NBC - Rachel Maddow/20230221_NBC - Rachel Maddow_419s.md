# Why predictions about Russia's war in Ukraine were so wrong, and how to adjust expecations
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g)
*  Now, with Ukraine having held off Russia for a year, I think it's fair to say that the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=0.0s)]
*  dominant expectation is that a long, grinding war in the long run benefits Russia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=5.62s)]
*  However inspiring and resilient the Ukrainian people have shown themselves to be, ultimately [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=12.68s)]
*  Russia is a much bigger country and per capita it's paying a much lower cost for this war. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  And so in that formulation, time is on Russia's side. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  The longer the war grinds on, the more likely it is that Russia comes out the ultimate victor. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=25.96s)]
*  Now not everyone holds that view, of course, but I think it's fairly, I think it's fair [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  to say that it's a widely held Western expectation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=35.04s)]
*  Given how badly widely held Western expectations have fared over the course of this past year [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=39.96s)]
*  when it comes to this war, I think perhaps it's worth looking at that one too. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=46.28s)]
*  On the occasion of President Biden's surprise trip to Kiev today to meet with President [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=52.12s)]
*  Zelensky in Ukraine, Anne Applebaum argues in The Atlantic that actually in this case, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  part of what President Biden's trip to Kiev says is that time isn't on Russia's side, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  time is on Ukraine's side. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=69.44s)]
*  And that's a message that everybody, including Russia, should now get. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=71.96s)]
*  How could that be? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=76.44s)]
*  Joining us now is Anne Applebaum. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=77.44s)]
*  She's a Pulitzer Prize winner, staff writer at The Atlantic. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=79.36s)]
*  Anne Applebaum, thank you so much for being here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=81.92s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=83.52s)]
*  Delighted. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=86.52s)]
*  First, let me just ask you if you agree with that framing, that there have been some big [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=87.52s)]
*  Western expectations about how this last year would go that have been wrong, proved wrong [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=92.8s)]
*  at a pretty fundamental level. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=99.44s)]
*  Look, we got almost everything about this war wrong. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=101.72s)]
*  A year ago today, most people expected the capital in Kiev to fall within a few days. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=107.92s)]
*  They thought Zelensky would flee the country, the president of Ukraine. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=114.16s)]
*  If he wasn't going to flee the country, they thought he would be almost certainly assassinated [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=117.98s)]
*  or would be very quickly arrested or eliminated. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=121.72s)]
*  There were lists circulating of Ukrainians who were due to be arrested. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=126.2s)]
*  That didn't happen. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=129.4s)]
*  We were very wrong both about the Russian military and about the Ukrainians. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=131.22s)]
*  We didn't factor in the corruption of Russia. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=137.76s)]
*  When we heard how much money had been spent on the Russian military, we thought it had [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=140.96s)]
*  gone to buying weapons. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  Actually turned out that quite a lot of it had gone to buy villas in the south of France [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=145.28s)]
*  or apartments in London. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=149.34s)]
*  And I think we missed the story of Ukraine. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=151.36s)]
*  We missed the reconstruction of Ukraine that took place after 2014. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=153.56s)]
*  We missed the resurgence of Ukrainian civil society. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=157.32s)]
*  It's a society that's really built from the ground up and not the top down. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=160.4s)]
*  A lot of young people run it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=166.4s)]
*  You see many ministers and deputy ministers who are in their 30s and 40s. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=168.72s)]
*  They really replaced the generation of kind of post-Soviet leaders who led the country [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=172.8s)]
*  up until eight or nine years ago. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=177.24s)]
*  And we misread how the war was going to go. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=181.44s)]
*  And so I think it's worth continually asking ourselves whether we're not misreading what's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  going to happen in the next few months or the next couple of years as well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=189.72s)]
*  So I think you're framing in that sense is absolutely right. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=193.28s)]
*  And all of those mistakes or false assumptions or things that have been proven wrong, all [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  sort of go in one direction. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  They all lend to us overestimating Russia's capabilities and underestimating Ukraine's. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  Is it possible now after a year that we're in danger of overcorrecting for that and overestimating [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=210.0s)]
*  what Ukraine can withstand, underestimating what Russia, particularly the Russian military, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=215.64s)]
*  is capable of? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=222.0s)]
*  So the Russian military, most people who are watching it don't think that the Russian [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=226.24s)]
*  military is capable of anything extraordinary and credible. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=229.6s)]
*  They're not capable of any great breakthroughs. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=232.76s)]
*  They are. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=235.56s)]
*  They have a lot of people whom they're willing to sacrifice. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=236.56s)]
*  They've proved that they're willing to tolerate really an extraordinary number of casualties [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=239.52s)]
*  that unimaginable, for example, in the United States, that we could have up to 200,000 casualties [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=243.88s)]
*  and that there would be no public outcry or no objection, especially in a war that most [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=248.8s)]
*  people aren't interested in or don't feel strongly about or even really are afraid to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=254.32s)]
*  discuss. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=260.32s)]
*  So, of course, I don't want to indicate that Russia is to be somehow discounted or ignored. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=261.32s)]
*  As you've said earlier in the program, President Putin is going to make a speech tomorrow, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=269.68s)]
*  which may well call for a new mobilization. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=274.12s)]
*  He might call for the move to a war economy. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=276.92s)]
*  He might close the borders. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  All kinds of things are possible. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=280.64000000000004s)]
*  But I also think we should keep in mind Ukrainians have been working very hard to think about [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=282.58000000000004s)]
*  new and different ways to fight. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=288.32s)]
*  They are good at reinventing weapons, changing the way they work, whether it's cheap drones [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  or more expensive American equipment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=298.6s)]
*  They sometimes have made it work in new ways. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=302.64s)]
*  They use it in unusual ways. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=304.9s)]
*  I know that they're thinking hard about what advantages they can have against a large military [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  Russian force. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=313.34s)]
*  And I think it's important not to underestimate them again either. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  It's also a war in which I think we have to take into consideration the possibility of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=319.9s)]
*  Black Swan events. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=323.97999999999996s)]
*  We don't really know what's going on inside the Kremlin. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=326.9s)]
*  We don't have any way of finding out. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=329.26s)]
*  Many things could change very quickly. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=332.02s)]
*  Public support for the war in Russia could crumble very quickly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=334.82s)]
*  Public support in the sense of the small number of people around Putin could change rapidly [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=338.58s)]
*  once it becomes clear that the war can't be won. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=344.62s)]
*  So there are lots of strange and unexpected factors that I'd hate to sit here and make [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=347.18s)]
*  bad predictions one year into the war when, as I said a year ago, people got almost everything [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=354.98s)]
*  wrong. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=359.94s)]
*  But as you say, I think it's wise to say watch out for the unexpected. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=361.86s)]
*  And I think that actually includes watching out for what we're going to hear tomorrow [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=367.54s)]
*  from President Putin in his sort of state of the state speech. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=370.66s)]
*  Those potential previews that you gave there in terms of what people will be looking for, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=375.1s)]
*  moving to a wartime economy, potentially closing the borders, other extreme measures like that, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=378.9s)]
*  could put things on a very different footing for him domestically. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=384.86s)]
*  It'll be really interesting to watch. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=387.06s)]
*  I'm Anne Applebaum, staff writer at The Atlantic. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=389.82s)]
*  I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=391.02s)]
*  I know you've been traveling a lot recently and this is late at night. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=392.58s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=396.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzCFAikT72g&t=398.65999999999997s)]
