# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Aug. 1
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY)
*  After the 9-11 attacks, it took about 10 years for the United States government to get Osama Bin Laden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=0.0s)]
*  They got him in May 2011. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=7.0s)]
*  Now, as of tonight, we know it took another 11 years after that to get Bin Laden's brain. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=10.0s)]
*  To get the man who was Bin Laden's number two in al-Qaeda at the time of 9-11, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=17.0s)]
*  the man who took over as al-Qaeda's leader after Bin Laden was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=21.0s)]
*  The string of attacks and murders attributed to Ayman al-Zawahiri is stomach-churning. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=27.0s)]
*  He was the ideological mastermind behind the turn of al-Qaeda and groups like that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=35.0s)]
*  toward indiscriminate mass murder of civilians anywhere, including Muslims, all in the name of Islamic piety. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=42.0s)]
*  And how he got there, now looking back at it, it seems like a straight shot, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=51.0s)]
*  but if you sort of dropped in at him at any time in his biography, you wouldn't have known he was going there. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=56.0s)]
*  He was trained as a doctor. He was a trained surgeon. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=60.0s)]
*  He was from a respected family in Egypt, born and raised in Cairo. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=63.0s)]
*  By the time he was 15 years old, he was a committed radical who wanted to try to impose Islamic theocracy by force. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=68.0s)]
*  He formed his first terrorist cell with the aim of overthrowing the government of Egypt when he was all of 15 years old. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=75.0s)]
*  When Islamic militants did assassinate Egypt's president, Anwar Sadat, at a military parade in 1981, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=83.0s)]
*  Ayman al-Zawahiri was one of hundreds of Islamist radicals who was tried and imprisoned for that crime. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=90.0s)]
*  He was tortured for years in Egyptian prisons. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=97.0s)]
*  While he was there, he became an informant, supplying information on his comrades to the Egyptian security services. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=101.0s)]
*  He was released from prison in Egypt in 1984, even more radical than when he had gone in. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=108.0s)]
*  He nurtured the growth of his terrorist group, which he had literally founded as a teenager. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=113.0s)]
*  It was called Al Jihad, or Islamic Jihad. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=119.0s)]
*  He spent time after his release from prison in Saudi Arabia, in Pakistan, in Afghanistan. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=122.0s)]
*  He eventually became close with a rich Saudi Arabian guy who in 1988 had founded his own terrorist organization. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=128.0s)]
*  The Saudi guy was wealthy enough that he was able to bankroll much of their movement himself. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=136.0s)]
*  He also had great connections all across the Arab world. He was a great recruiter to their cause. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=143.0s)]
*  Ayman al-Zawahiri eventually became the Saudi guy's personal doctor, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=148.0s)]
*  which gave them a personal bond beyond even their ideological co-interests. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=152.0s)]
*  After the two of them supplied and supported the Afghan Mujahideen fighters against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=158.0s)]
*  around 1990 they moved on to Sudan and on to Yemen to establish training camps there for international terrorists. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=165.0s)]
*  At that time, though, Zawahiri was still really focused on trying to overthrow the government in Egypt. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=174.0s)]
*  That was his lifelong dream. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=179.0s)]
*  In November 1993, his group, Islamic Jihad, tried to assassinate the prime minister of Egypt. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=181.0s)]
*  They failed in that assassination attempt, but they did wound and kill civilians instead. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=187.0s)]
*  Two years later, in 1995, Egyptian Islamic Jihad blew up the Egyptian embassy in Pakistan, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=193.0s)]
*  killed at least 15 people, wounded dozens of people. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=200.0s)]
*  Two years later, in 1997, Zawahiri helped plan the Luxor attack. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=203.0s)]
*  This was a half dozen gunmen descending on a big Egyptian tourist attraction just before nine in the morning in November 1997. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=209.0s)]
*  The gunmen, those six gunmen, spent 45 minutes methodically massacring the tourists at that tourist site in Egypt, including kids. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=217.0s)]
*  People from Egypt, people from Colombia, people from Switzerland and the UK and Japan and Germany, 62 people murdered. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=227.0s)]
*  Zawahiri was the mastermind of that. That was 1997. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=237.0s)]
*  In 1998, Zawahiri wrote what amounted to a declaration of war against America. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=242.0s)]
*  He proclaimed that groups like his and his friend Osama bin Laden's group, al-Qaeda, and all the Islamist terrorist groups he proclaimed were all united [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=249.0s)]
*  as what he called the International Front Against Crusaders and Jews, not to put too fine a point on it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=257.0s)]
*  Zawahiri's declaration in February 1998 proclaimed it their mission to target America, to target the United States of America, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=264.0s)]
*  and specifically to kill American people anywhere in the world. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=273.0s)]
*  That was February 1998 that he wrote that declaration of war. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=278.0s)]
*  Later that same year, in August 1998, they blew up the US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=282.0s)]
*  More than 4,000 people injured, more than 200 people killed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=288.0s)]
*  Then in October 2000, they hit the USS Cole, a guided missile destroyer, while it was being refueled in Yemen. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=295.0s)]
*  17 US sailors killed, 37 injured. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=302.0s)]
*  The year after that, in June 2001, al-Qaeda, bin Laden's group, formally absorbed Zawahiri's group, Islamic Jihad. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=307.0s)]
*  He and Osama bin Laden from that point forward were no longer just fellow travelers and compatriots. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=317.0s)]
*  Now, as of June 2001, al-Qaeda was it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=323.0s)]
*  Zawahiri was bin Laden's second-in-command. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=327.0s)]
*  And also, informally, his brain, his strategic thinker, his ideological guide, his doctor, the chief operating officer of al-Qaeda. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=330.0s)]
*  Two days before the 9-11 attacks, in an operation masterminded by Zawahiri, a man named Ahmed Shah Massoud was assassinated. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=343.0s)]
*  He was the leader of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, the strongest leader in that country opposed to the Taliban. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=352.0s)]
*  Zawahiri wiped him out on September 9, 2001, doing a huge favor to the Taliban, indebting the Taliban to himself, essentially. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=359.0s)]
*  And then two days later, of course, they rained down hell on the United States of America on September 11, 2001, in Pennsylvania, in New York City, at the Pentagon. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=370.0s)]
*  This was the first wanted poster put out for Ayman al-Zawahiri after 9-11. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=383.0s)]
*  This is from October 2001, just weeks after the attack. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=388.0s)]
*  You see the reward for information leading to his capture at that point was $5 million. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=392.0s)]
*  That would soon quintuple to a $25 million reward, largest reward offered for anyone on Earth. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=396.0s)]
*  After a U.S. Navy SEAL mission in 2011 took out Osama bin Laden, Zawahiri became the head of al-Qaeda. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=405.0s)]
*  And at that point, Zawahiri became literally the most wanted terrorist on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=412.0s)]
*  And you can see, if you look at the two different wanted posters, you can see that over 20 years plus, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=420.0s)]
*  while the reward did go up, you know, they didn't change the photo of him. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=425.0s)]
*  They didn't change much about what they knew about him or how to advise people to find him. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=429.0s)]
*  But tonight there is an update. Tonight they've updated the poster at long last. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=433.0s)]
*  This was just changed this evening as we were prepping to get on the air. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=438.0s)]
*  Put a big red deceased across the bottom of it now. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=442.0s)]
*  What we know is this. Ayman al-Zawahiri was back in Afghanistan, which itself is a story. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=446.0s)]
*  He was in a well-off neighborhood in the capital city of Kabul. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=453.0s)]
*  The New York Times and the Washington Post are reporting that the house where he was killed [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=457.0s)]
*  was owned by a senior member of the Taliban government known for having links to al-Qaeda. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=461.0s)]
*  The man's name is Haqqani, which is a familiar name when it comes to kidnappings [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=466.0s)]
*  and terrorist attacks and mass murder in Afghanistan over the past 20 plus years. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=470.0s)]
*  While the U.S. military no longer has anyone in Afghanistan, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=475.0s)]
*  the U.S. government was apparently able to obtain intelligence on Zawahiri's whereabouts [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=479.0s)]
*  dating back for several months. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=484.0s)]
*  They were specifically able to get information on the pattern of life at the house [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=486.0s)]
*  where they knew he was staying, dating all the way back to April. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=490.0s)]
*  And the reason that's important, the reason they were watching the pattern of life at that house [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=494.0s)]
*  was both to confirm that he was there, but also to try to find the right way and the right window [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=499.0s)]
*  to get him without getting anyone else, to get him and get him alone. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=503.0s)]
*  President Biden was briefed in detail on the prospects for a drone strike hitting that house. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=508.0s)]
*  The intelligence community reportedly built a physical model of the house that they wanted to hit. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=514.0s)]
*  They used that physical model to show the president their intentions and to brief the president [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=519.0s)]
*  on how the mission might unfold. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=524.0s)]
*  President Biden said in remarks to the nation tonight that he gave the order a week ago [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=526.0s)]
*  that they could strike when the right time and the right circumstances arose. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=531.0s)]
*  Those right circumstances and that right time apparently arose Saturday night, just before 10 p.m. Eastern, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=535.0s)]
*  which was just after 6 a.m. Sunday morning in Kabul. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=542.0s)]
*  It was reportedly two Hellfire missiles fired from a CIA-operated drone. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=546.0s)]
*  It has been 20 years and 10 months since Al-Qaeda killed 3,000 Americans on U.S. soil in the 9-11 attacks. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=551.0s)]
*  It took 20 years and 10 months to get the two guys who ran Al-Qaeda during that attack. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=561.0s)]
*  Astonishingly, the leader of the Republican Party, the party's last president and their likely next presidential nominee, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=568.0s)]
*  said just this weekend that, quote, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=575.0s)]
*  Nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9-11. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=578.0s)]
*  He literally said that this weekend. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=581.0s)]
*  Nobody's gotten to the bottom of 9-11. What was that all about? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=584.0s)]
*  Well, it took 20 years and 10 months, but actually somebody definitively has gotten to the bottom of 9-11. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=589.0s)]
*  Joining us now from London is Richard Engel, NBC News chief foreign correspondent who has covered Al-Qaeda [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=597.0s)]
*  and Aiman al-Zawahiri for decades, a man who knows more than your average bear about the Egyptian Islamic radicalism in Cairo [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=603.0s)]
*  that shapes Zawahiri. Richard, my friend, thank you for interrupting your vacation tonight. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=610.0s)]
*  Thank you for being up at O Dark 30 for us once again on this historic night. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=615.0s)]
*  It is a historic night and, of course, I think it's a very important night. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=622.0s)]
*  And, yes, I've been covering Aiman al-Zawahiri since the mid-1990s. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=626.0s)]
*  I was a reporter in Egypt when terrorist attacks were becoming an increasing problem in the country. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=631.0s)]
*  You mentioned the Luxor attack when a group of Islamists went on a rampage [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=638.0s)]
*  and just started massacring tourists in front of the pharaonic monuments there. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=644.0s)]
*  And then he decided to keep going and he joined up with Osama bin Laden, founded Al-Qaeda, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=649.0s)]
*  first as this international front against Jews and crusaders, and now we have come to where we are today. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=657.0s)]
*  And I think there are really two ways of looking at it. What you just heard from Admiral Kirby was a kind of a positive spin on it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=666.0s)]
*  It shows that the United States is still capable that if the Taliban goes back on its deal, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=673.0s)]
*  and clearly it was going back on its deal, or at least elements of the Taliban were going back on the deal [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=679.0s)]
*  and welcomed in Al-Qaeda, that they wouldn't be able to get away with it because America has eyes on [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=683.0s)]
*  and has the ability to carry out lethal strikes from the sky. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=689.0s)]
*  So you could say, oh, the policy is working because if there's Al-Qaeda infiltration or presence, the US can take care of it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=693.0s)]
*  But there's another way of looking at it. It shows how confident and how arrogant, one might say, the Taliban have become. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=700.0s)]
*  That even after swearing that they would never host Al-Qaeda leaders again, that they would never go back and repeat the past, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=707.0s)]
*  that they don't just have an Al-Qaeda leader, they have the Al-Qaeda leader. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=715.0s)]
*  He's hosted right in the center of Kabul. He's there for months. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=721.0s)]
*  And it shows that they believe they can do whatever they want. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=726.0s)]
*  I was in Afghanistan after US troops withdrew from the country, after the Taliban drove them out, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=731.0s)]
*  and I met Taliban leaders and they believed that what happened was a miracle, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=738.0s)]
*  that they were given this victory because of a gift from God, that they were untouchable. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=743.0s)]
*  You could look in their eyes. If you ever noticed, a lot of American reporters were going around with the Taliban, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=750.0s)]
*  there was no hostility. They were not just proud of what they had done and wanted to show it off. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=755.0s)]
*  They believed that this was a miracle and that it was their duty to show the world God's actions on Earth. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=761.0s)]
*  So when you have that kind of mentality, you're not really intimidated by what the US is threatening to do. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=770.0s)]
*  You say, well, we've gone through hard times in the past and look where our faith brought us. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=778.0s)]
*  So they had Bin Laden, they had Aymar al-Zawahiri in the country near the presidential palace for months. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=784.0s)]
*  The fact that the US got him shows that the US still has very good intelligence there, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=791.0s)]
*  still was able to get informants who were able to establish a pattern of life inside the building. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=796.0s)]
*  But over time, will those informants continue to be as good and will they be able to find other targets [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=801.0s)]
*  who aren't necessarily as famous as Aymar al-Zawahiri, who the US has been tracking for decades? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=809.0s)]
*  Well, and as you lay that out, I mean, this is obviously a very rude interruption to any reverie that the Taliban might have been under [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=816.0s)]
*  in terms of them believing that they were being, you know, that they were divinely inspired [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=823.0s)]
*  and that they were being divinely protected for their actions. This is going to interrupt that in some ways. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=828.0s)]
*  And I asked Admiral Kirby a moment ago if they're anticipating retaliation from the Taliban. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=833.0s)]
*  And if so, is the Taliban capable of inflicting pain on the United States in a way that will actually hurt? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=839.0s)]
*  He didn't answer. He basically said, well, watch for that. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=844.0s)]
*  But what do you think their reaction will be to this strike now that it's happened? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=847.0s)]
*  And again, I think probably surprised them given how willing they were to hide him relatively in a relatively easy to find place. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=852.0s)]
*  So first of all, there are big divisions in the Taliban, which is one thing that the Taliban weren't expecting. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=863.0s)]
*  You heard Admiral Kirby talk about the Haqqani Network. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=869.0s)]
*  That is a big group of the Taliban that is particularly close to al-Qaeda. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=872.0s)]
*  And not all of the other factions in the Taliban support them, but they are still a very, very powerful faction, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=877.0s)]
*  perhaps the most powerful in terms of security. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=885.0s)]
*  So a very large segment of the Taliban will be shamed that this happened. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=889.0s)]
*  They hosted this important figure with whom they have a relationship going back many, many years, and he was killed in their territory. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=894.0s)]
*  You know, the Taliban released a statement after a drone strike this weekend. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=904.0s)]
*  It seems to be the same drone strike. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=909.0s)]
*  They didn't say who the target was at the time. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=912.0s)]
*  And they called it a violation of their sovereignty against international norms. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=915.0s)]
*  And they said that it could close the doors for future cooperation and opportunities. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=920.0s)]
*  So in a way, the response was a rejection, but fairly measured when you look at other statements from the Taliban. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=926.0s)]
*  So they were angry. They're saying it's going to close the door for other cooperation. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=935.0s)]
*  And it's a problem, but they weren't threatening to burn down the White House or carry out an attack like this. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=939.0s)]
*  But there will certainly be elements within the Taliban and within al-Qaeda who will want to seek revenge. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=946.0s)]
*  That said, he was not a particularly charismatic leader. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=954.0s)]
*  He never really filled the shoes of Osama bin Laden. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=958.0s)]
*  Osama bin Laden was the face. He was the brand name of al-Qaeda. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=962.0s)]
*  Aymar al-Zawahiri was the legacy player. He was the intellectual. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=966.0s)]
*  He was the scholar, if you will, establishing the bedrock of the ideology. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=970.0s)]
*  But he never commanded a lot of personal loyalty within the group. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=975.0s)]
*  The next leader might be able to be more effective in that way. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=979.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Missouri. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=984.0s)]
*  The Republican primary for U.S. Senate there features the state's former Republican governor, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=986.0s)]
*  who was forced to resign from that job after about five minutes. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=990.0s)]
*  In a scandal over blackmailing his former mistress after he allegedly forced her into a non-consensual sexual encounter and then photographed it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=993.0s)]
*  More recently, Eric Greitens' ex-wife has accused him in court of physically abusing both her and their kids. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1002.0s)]
*  And he's released an ad that features him and other guys with guns in tactical gear pretending to hunt fellow Republicans [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1009.0s)]
*  they deem insufficiently Trumpy by storming into their house with guns. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1018.0s)]
*  Eric Greitens' main rival for the U.S. Senate nomination in Missouri is another man named Eric. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1023.0s)]
*  His name is Eric Schmidt. He's the sitting attorney general in Missouri. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1028.0s)]
*  You may best remember him for joining a lawsuit to try to get the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Biden's election and then launching a fundraising effort off of it. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1032.0s)]
*  Tonight, I guess this is breaking news. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1040.0s)]
*  On the eve of tomorrow's Missouri primary, Donald Trump released an endorsement in this contest between Eric Greitens and Eric Schmidt. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1043.0s)]
*  Trump says he is endorsing Eric. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1051.0s)]
*  I'm not kidding. This is actually what Trump's endorsement press release says. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1056.0s)]
*  I'm therefore proud to announce that Eric has my complete and total endorsement. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1060.0s)]
*  And yes, both Eric's have enthusiastically accepted that endorsement tonight. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1064.0s)]
*  Absolutely unreal. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1068.0s)]
*  President Biden joined the small but growing group of Americans who've gotten COVID and then taken the antiviral drug Paxlovid. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1073.0s)]
*  With the help of Paxlovid, a powerful antiviral, they've recovered from COVID, tested negative, only to have what they're calling a rebound. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1081.0s)]
*  After finishing the five-day course of the Paxlovid pills and testing negative at the end of it, the president, like many Americans, then tested positive again a couple of days later. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1089.0s)]
*  Now, statistically, they say this is a rare thing. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1099.0s)]
*  The data says of only about two to six percent of people who take Paxlovid face a rebound from COVID like this. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1102.0s)]
*  But the president being one of those people puts a real spotlight on it and raises some interesting questions for future research. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1109.0s)]
*  The president's doctor said today, importantly, that the president continues to feel well, even though he's still testing positive as of this morning. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1115.0s)]
*  And that's the important bottom line here. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1122.0s)]
*  He's OK. Paxlovid is working. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1125.0s)]
*  It has been working for thousands of Americans, keeping people alive and out of the hospital and ideally dealing with relatively mild symptoms, just like the president has experienced. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1127.0s)]
*  But like the president, people who get these rebound cases after completing a course of Paxlovid, they face a couple of tricky questions, particularly around infectiousness. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1137.0s)]
*  Are you contagious once you start testing positive again? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1146.0s)]
*  The consensus there is probably yes. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1149.0s)]
*  The CDC now says if you get a Paxlovid rebound, you got to go back into isolation for another five days and then wear your mask for another 10 days, just as if it's a new infection. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1151.0s)]
*  That's the protocol the president's under right now. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1161.0s)]
*  Researchers are still investigating Paxlovid rebound. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1164.0s)]
*  But for people who are taking that antiviral drug and excited to press excited to test negative at the end of that five day course. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1167.0s)]
*  The increasing visibility of Paxlovid rebound shows that a negative test at the end of that course of drugs might just be a temporary reprieve. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1176.0s)]
*  And your infectiousness might still be a live issue that has implications for everybody taking that treatment. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1184.0s)]
*  Definitely still gaps in our knowledge here. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1190.0s)]
*  But the president's announcement about this should spur new new research, if not new recommendations, hopefully sooner rather than later. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1192.0s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1200.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo0pitfWeZY&t=1206.0s)]
