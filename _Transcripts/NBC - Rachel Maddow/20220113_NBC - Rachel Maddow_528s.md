# Oath Keeper Seditious Conspiracy Indictment Describes A Threat Beyond January 6th
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM)
*  Person one, the leader of the Oath Keepers, is a guy named Stuart Rhodes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=0.0s)]
*  And yes, that is him with the eyepatch. You will be shocked to learn it had something to do with [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=4.88s)]
*  the unsafe handling of firearms. Yeah, a little accident with a gun. That's what happened to the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=9.76s)]
*  eye. But ever since the 2020 presidential election, as 17 Oath Keepers were arrested and charged for [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=14.64s)]
*  attacking the Capitol in various capacities, as some of those Oath Keepers pled guilty and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=22.56s)]
*  signed cooperation deals with federal prosecutors. Throughout all of this time, the Oath Keepers [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=27.84s)]
*  leader with the eyepatch, this guy Stuart Rhodes, has been unavoidable for comment. He has been [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  loudly telling any reporter who gets anywhere near him that yes, the election was absolutely [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=38.24s)]
*  stolen from Donald Trump. And yes, he absolutely encouraged Oath Keepers to be in D.C. on January [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=44.0s)]
*  6th. And yes, he was there at the Capitol that day communicating with his fellow Oath Keepers. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=49.2s)]
*  But he always takes pains to say that he definitely did not break the law because he is way too smart [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=53.92s)]
*  to have done anything illegal. Well, today, Stuart Rhodes was arrested just after lunchtime in Texas. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  That's his mugshot. Another Oath Keeper guy was arrested in Phoenix around the same time. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=67.36s)]
*  And they, along with nine other Oath Keepers who had already been arrested and charged in the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=74.64s)]
*  Capitol attack in various capacities, the 11 of them today were all indicted on the very serious [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=80.08s)]
*  charge of seditious conspiracy. Now, seditious conspiracy is a charge that derives from the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  concept of sedition, right? It is a charge that prosecutors have been openly mulling since the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  very beginning of the investigation. You might remember when the Justice Department used to do [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=100.32s)]
*  briefings for the public and the press in the immediate aftermath of the attack, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=104.16s)]
*  they talked not infrequently at those briefings about seditious conspiracy as a potential charge. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=107.68s)]
*  They did that right away. But now it is, of course, more than a year after the attack. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  This is the first time they have actually used it in the indictment unsealed today. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=117.68s)]
*  And seditious conspiracy basically means a conspiracy to commit sedition, a conspiracy [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=122.48s)]
*  against the government. Specifically, the way that's written in the statute, it's a conspiracy [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  to stop the government from carrying out its laws by force. Here's how the indictment [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=133.28s)]
*  describes it. They call it the plot to oppose by force the 2020 lawful transfer of presidential [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=141.28s)]
*  power. Quote, beginning in November 2020, Rhodes, defendant Stuart Rhodes, began disseminating [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  messages on encrypted applications that encouraged his co-conspirators to oppose by force the lawful [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=153.76s)]
*  transfer of. Number fifth, 2020, two days after the presidential election, Mr. Rhodes urged his [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=159.44s)]
*  followers to refuse to accept the election result and stated, quote, We aren't getting through this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=167.04s)]
*  without a civil war. Too late for that. Prepare your mind, body, spirit. On November two days [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=171.84s)]
*  later, on November 7th, 2020, the day that President Trump was projected to have lost [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=178.4s)]
*  the presidential election, Mr. Rhodes wrote to fellow oath keepers, quote, We must now do what [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=182.8s)]
*  the people of Serbia did when Milosevic stole their election, refused to accept it and march [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=188.48s)]
*  en masse on the nation's capital. He spelled en masse wrong, but that's okay. Mr. Rhodes appears [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  to be in those comments, referring to the storming of the the Serbian parliament in 2000. Mr. Rhodes [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  shared with his followers a video and step by step instruction guide to overthrowing the government [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=210.56s)]
*  that he said he received from a Serbian activist. That step by step guide specifically included [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=215.2s)]
*  storming the parliament in our country. We don't call it the parliament. We call it the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  capital because it's how it houses our Congress. But same idea. The indictment continues, quote, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=224.0s)]
*  on December 11th, 2020, Rhodes sent a message to fellow oath keepers that stated that if President [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=229.6s)]
*  Biden were to assume the presidency, quote, It will be a bloody and desperate fight. We are going [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=234.88s)]
*  to have a fight that can't be avoided. On December 25th, Merry Christmas. Mr. Rhodes wrote, quote, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=240.16s)]
*  I think Congress will screw him, meaning screw President Trump over. The only chance we slash [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=247.12s)]
*  he has is if we scare the out of them and convince them it will be torches and pitchforks time if [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=252.64s)]
*  they don't do the right thing. But I don't think they will listen. On December 31st, Happy New Year, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=258.56s)]
*  an Arizona quick reaction force team member messaged Mr. Rhodes on signal that people were [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=265.36s)]
*  coming to Washington, D.C. and that, quote, Everyone coming has their own technical equipment [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=271.44s)]
*  and knows how to use it. Adding a winky face emoji, Mr. Rhodes responded. Awesome. The Arizona [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=275.44s)]
*  Oath Keeper also said the group would have rifles and manpower. On January 6th itself, Mr. Stewart [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=282.64000000000004s)]
*  Rhodes and his fellow Oath Keepers did all go to Washington. Many of them were apparently stationed [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=290.8s)]
*  with what they called these quick reaction forces just outside the district where they stockpiled [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  weapons, presumably ready to be able to access them on short notice and come blazing in. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  And these, you know, these stacks of Oath Keepers began heading toward the Capitol and up the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  Capitol steps become the sort of point of the spear for actually breaking into the seat of the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=314.72s)]
*  nation's government. According to today's indictment, there was not one but two stacks [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=320.24s)]
*  of Oath Keepers who breached the Capitol at different places. Apparently one part of one [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=325.6s)]
*  of those stacks was specifically looking to try to find Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The indictment says, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=329.92s)]
*  quote, Just before 1 30 p.m. in response to a claim by an Oath Keepers affiliate that Antifa [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=336.0s)]
*  had breached the Capitol, Mr. Rhodes replied, quote, Nope, I'm right here. These are patriots. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=341.44s)]
*  Rhodes then wrote, quote, Pence is doing nothing. As I predicted, all I see Trump doing is [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=347.84s)]
*  complaining. I see no intent by him to do anything. So the patriots are taking it into [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=352.4s)]
*  their own hands. They've had enough. At approximately 1 30 p.m., Oath Keepers affiliates on the chat group [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=357.36s)]
*  with Mr. Rhodes posted messages about police officers deploying pepper spray at the Capitol [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=364.96s)]
*  and questioned what the rioters hoped would happen if they got inside the Capitol. Person with Rhodes [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=369.04s)]
*  at the time responded, quote, We are acting like the founding fathers can't stand down. Stewart and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=374.08s)]
*  I concur. Mr. Rhodes followed, quote, Hey, the founding generation stormed the governor's mansion [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=380.08s)]
*  in Massachusetts and Tarden feathered his tax collectors and they seized and dumped tea in the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=384.96s)]
*  water. They didn't fire on them, but they street fought. That's where we are now. Next comes our [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=390.0s)]
*  Lexington. It's coming. Just one more thing. I just want to share with you from today's indictment [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=395.76s)]
*  because it actually continues beyond January 6th. There's a section of the indictment titled [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=403.2s)]
*  Co conspirators continue plotting after the January 6th attack on the Capitol. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=408.0s)]
*  Throughout the evening of January 6th, 2021, the co conspirators discussed the need to continue [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=413.52s)]
*  fighting to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power in the weeks after January 6th. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=419.68s)]
*  Rhodes purchased a large volume of firearms and related equipment. The indictment then lists [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=425.84s)]
*  thousands of dollars, tens of thousands of dollars worth of sites and bipods and scopes [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=432.4s)]
*  and mounts and backpacks and gun grips, ammunition, firearms, parts, gun cases, holsters [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=437.28s)]
*  and gun maintenance equipment all purchased by Mr. Rhodes at that time. You see the dates there, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=443.2s)]
*  January 10, January 11, January 12, January 13, January 14 through 19. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  Adding up all the purchases listed in the indictment that Rhodes made of firearms and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=454.23999999999995s)]
*  related equipment over that short burst of time, he spent something like $40,000 [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=458.16s)]
*  right around January 6th just on weaponry. Quote, on inauguration day, January 20th, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=464.0s)]
*  2021, one oath keeper messaged another quote, after this, if nothing happens, it's war, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=471.12s)]
*  civil war 2.0. Around this time, quote, Mr. Rhodes messaged others to organize local militias [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=476.64000000000004s)]
*  to oppose President Biden's administration. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=484.16s)]
*  For the oath keepers, January 6th was not the end point. It was apparently the beginning of a new [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=489.44s)]
*  phase of their fight against the government. As of today, 11 of them are facing seditious conspiracy [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=494.56s)]
*  charges, which is a serious felony count brought by U.S. federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=500.88s)]
*  . [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJuPIIRoLoM&t=513.6s)]
