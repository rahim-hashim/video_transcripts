# Concerns about violence from Trump supporters in connection with federal indictment
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc)
*  Back on this historic day of news, my colleague Rachel Maddow has been monitoring some of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=0.0s)]
*  the, for lack of a better word, bitch for y'all, coming out from the right. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=5.92s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Well, Nicole, one of the things that we're watching today is not only what this means [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  personally for Donald Trump and for his political future and all the rest of it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=16.34s)]
*  What we're watching is to see what this means for the country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  And Donald Trump has been pretty explicit in warning that if the legal system is used to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=24.12s)]
*  hold him to account, that he will call on his supporters to respond through means of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=29.36s)]
*  protest or through means of fighting or other terms like that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=36.98s)]
*  Well, we've certainly seen already in pro-Trump message boards and things online, we've seen [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=41.12s)]
*  people definitely calling for violence. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=46.92s)]
*  We saw some of that after his first indictment as well. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=48.78s)]
*  But we've also seen a couple of things from Republican members of Congress. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  What's on the screen right here is from Congressman, Republican Congressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  President Trump said this is from last night. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=59.4s)]
*  President Trump said he has been summoned to appear at the federal courthouse in Miami [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=62.96s)]
*  on Tuesday. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=65.88s)]
*  This is a perimeter probe from the oppressors. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=67.04s)]
*  Hold. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=70.48s)]
*  Our POTUS has this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=72.0s)]
*  Our POTUS is a thing that Trump people use, which means real president of the United States, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=73.52s)]
*  implying that he actually was reelected, even though he was not. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=77.48s)]
*  This is a perimeter probe from the oppressors. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=81.2s)]
*  Hold. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=83.48s)]
*  Our POTUS has this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=84.48s)]
*  Buckle up. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=85.76s)]
*  1 over 50K, which I think is a reference to the scale on military maps. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=86.76s)]
*  Know your bridges, which presumably means like be ready when it comes to knowing about [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  critical infrastructure. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  Rock, steady, calm. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=100.56s)]
*  That is all. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=102.48s)]
*  So, this is a perimeter probe from the oppressors and then this reference in military jargon [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=103.48s)]
*  to what people should be doing in response to it with the specific reference to which [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=108.72s)]
*  courthouse Trump is going to be in on Tuesday and at what time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  That was from Clay Higgins last night. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  I think you saw some sort of alarmed response to that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=118.92s)]
*  What exactly is Congressman Higgins doing here? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=122.4s)]
*  But then this afternoon it got a little bit worse. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=124.3s)]
*  Republican Congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona posting this this afternoon. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  Quote, we have now reached a war phase. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=132.88s)]
*  Eye for an eye. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=136.24s)]
*  So again, we are seeing Trump supporters and Trump, you know, media pro Trump media personalities [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=137.68s)]
*  on the right effectively calling for violence, at least cause it calling for some sort of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=143.72s)]
*  physical resistance to this act by the Justice Department. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=148.68s)]
*  But to have members of Congress using language like this, I'm glad it is not more than two [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=152.24s)]
*  of them thus far. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=158.54s)]
*  But we are seeing at least a couple of them get pretty far out on a limb to the point [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=159.64s)]
*  where that limb starts breaking in terms of whether or not we are a country that's going [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=163.96s)]
*  to accept that everybody's bound by the rule of law and we have to let the process play [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=167.4s)]
*  out. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=171.2s)]
*  So, Rachel, we have one investigation, the January 6th select committee probe that was [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  able to track the impact of the December 19th tweet come, you know, quote, will be wild [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=177.64s)]
*  to the acts for which two groups, militia members were found guilty of seditious conspiracy. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  We have a current warning by DHS and the FBI governing our whole country right now saying [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=192.32s)]
*  that around political events and political actors, basically every group except for [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=198.68s)]
*  Republican men are a potential target for violence. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=203.68s)]
*  And we have in the era of Trump acts of political violence that have been carried out against [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=208.22s)]
*  the speaker's husband against election workers in New Mexico. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=213.72s)]
*  I mean, it's not a will it happen? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=217.8s)]
*  It's a has it happened and will it happen again? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=221.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=224.44s)]
*  And, you know, it's interesting to see. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=225.44s)]
*  We also have Florida, Rachel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=228.16s)]
*  We have Florida. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=229.76s)]
*  We have the fact that, you know, that is Enrique Tarrio's base. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=230.76s)]
*  It has become a proud boy's hotbed and it has become those who watch national security [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  are concerned about Florida becoming a magnet for extremists and extremism. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=241.84s)]
*  It is the planning base of, you know, MAGA right now. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=246.92s)]
*  It is the headquarters. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=250.56s)]
*  And I, you know, it's concerning that a member of Congress, a member of the body that was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=252.28s)]
*  attacked on January 6th would actually do a stand back and stand by type tweet in, you [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=256.76s)]
*  know, in reference to Donald Trump. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=264.76s)]
*  And if that was last night, that's before anybody got a chance to read the indictment. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  It is actually frightening. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=270.6s)]
*  And I think, you know, the security around that Miami courthouse had better be it better [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=271.88s)]
*  be real tight because this isn't having to fly people into D.C. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=276.8s)]
*  Miami already has the problem. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=281.36s)]
*  Miami already has it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=284.2s)]
*  And let's be reminded that Florida is now a no permit carry state. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=285.32s)]
*  It is now a state where the governor is encouraging it to become more like Texas in terms of, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  you know, wielding firearms. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  It's this stuff is the stuff that makes you lose sleep because Florida ain't the Florida [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=300.36s)]
*  that I lived in. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=305.2s)]
*  Florida has become much more extremist. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=305.92s)]
*  And it's a little scary to have members of Congress stoking this. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes. And I think the thing to watch to joy is what Trump himself calls for from his supporters, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  because I think one of the underappreciated things about the other his earlier indictment [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  a couple of months ago in New York is that I do think it was somewhat humiliating for [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=323.04s)]
*  Trump that he called for nationwide protests like the country has never seen in response [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  to that indictment. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=333.32000000000005s)]
*  And it was like, you know, a handful of people on a bridge going to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=334.68s)]
*  It was a handful of people on a bridge going to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  It was whoever just turned off the screen behind me. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  It was an incredible protest. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=343.16s)]
*  But it was, you know, in New York on the day of his indictment in New York or his arraignment [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=345.6s)]
*  in New York. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there was like a busload of people in New York. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  But he really wanted the whole country shut down by mass pro-Trump civil disobedience. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=352.76s)]
*  And he didn't get it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  And it was a humiliation. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  And he's very, you know, he's very attuned to his crowd sizes. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  And so it may be that he approaches this differently in terms of asking for something that he [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=363.8s)]
*  might not get. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=368.24s)]
*  But you're absolutely right, Joy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=369.24s)]
*  The geography here matters. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=370.6s)]
*  And asking for it in Manhattan might be a totally different kettle of fish than asking [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=371.88s)]
*  for it in Florida. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=375.92s)]
*  Alex, I was going to say, you know, I think it's really meaningful that it's members of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=377.52s)]
*  Congress that are saying this, that are using this military lingo. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=381.92s)]
*  A, as someone who's spoken to former militia members in advance of January 6, a lot of [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=385.36s)]
*  these guys that were responsible for January 6 are ex-military, current military. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=390.64s)]
*  They're in law enforcement. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=394.8s)]
*  They understand what that means. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  And we're not talking about an ousted former president calling for this. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  We're talking about people who are currently in Congress, who, by the way, the president [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=400.68s)]
*  has tasked with getting him off the hook and who have so far been falling in line. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, if you see what the Oversight Committee has been doing in recent weeks, if you look [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  at what the Judiciary Committee has been doing in recent weeks, they're listening to Trump [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=412.48s)]
*  and they have power. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=416.72s)]
*  And that is a real distinction, right? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=418.8s)]
*  I mean, we know that Congress has tried to mess around with Alvin Bragg, but we know [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=422.44s)]
*  Jim Jordan, Comer, the rest of them, they are very fired up about this. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=427.04s)]
*  And now you have these tweets that are really in no uncertain terms calling for military [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=432.08s)]
*  footing. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6Jzg2zcrgc&t=436.08s)]
