# Morale Remains High In Kyiv Despite Concerns About Food Supply, Basic Needs
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA)
*  We heard a lot from our viewers about a man we talked to on Friday's show, a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=0.0s)]
*  resident of Keefe, a restaurant owner named Alexander Prokorenko. He told us [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=5.54s)]
*  he was still in the capital city but he was actually planning to leave after the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  show after we spoke with him. He has still not been able to leave. He and his [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=12.9s)]
*  family can't get gas for a car, also the trains are just packed. For those who [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=16.66s)]
*  have had to stay like Alexander and his neighbors, they've been forced to adapt [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=22.18s)]
*  over these last few days to make sure they're ready for what they think may be [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=26.54s)]
*  coming. This is some new video he just sent us of the very cold underground [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=29.72s)]
*  parking garage where he and his neighbors have been spending their [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=34.44s)]
*  nights. He tells us they did pick up some weapons this weekend, the ones the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=36.54s)]
*  Ukrainian government has been handing out. Neither he or any of his neighbors [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=40.94s)]
*  have any military training but Alexander said they're teaching themselves. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=45.06s)]
*  They're now taking turns guarding their building. His turn started today at 3am. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=48.54s)]
*  They're also making rounds to try to find food. Alexander says he decided to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=53.84s)]
*  get a special permit to allow him to move around Kiev. When he got that permit, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=58.78s)]
*  the government put these yellow markers on his car to alert authorities that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=63.32s)]
*  he's cleared to travel, that he's not a threat. Still though, people manning [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=66.78s)]
*  checkpoints aren't taking any chances. He's been stopped and checked repeatedly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=71.02s)]
*  In this case, he thanked the armed forces that stopped him, took a photo with [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=75.18s)]
*  them. He called them my guys. Alexander is using his ability to drive in the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=78.82s)]
*  streets of Kiev to help. He's driving neighbors to the train station buying [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=83.46s)]
*  groceries for people. Here he is driving neighbors to the train, going to a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  nearby cafe to pick up food to donate. You can tell that not a lot of people [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=91.32s)]
*  have gotten permits to move around or people who've, you know, not a lot of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=96.72s)]
*  people have stayed if they could leave. The streets, as he shows us here, are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=100.52s)]
*  empty. Of course, the thing that disrupts the silence are sirens and bombs and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  airstrikes. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  They're attacking Kiev. Every time we just hear it, then big explosion, like a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=111.61999999999999s)]
*  huge one. Yes, we have to run because of the airstrikes. They just went up to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=116.64s)]
*  the apartment to get some, you know, rest because there wasn't any any [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=124.04s)]
*  bombing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=129.72s)]
*  that you have to go now. Alexander and his neighbors are still in that [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=131.44s)]
*  freezing underground parking garage, protecting themselves, trying to protect [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=136.0s)]
*  their building, trying to stay safe. They are keeping the couple of guns they [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=139.5s)]
*  have and the few bullets they have nearby. But that doesn't mean they want [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=142.78s)]
*  this fight. Joining us again is Kiev resident and restaurant owner Alexander [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=146.78s)]
*  Prokorenko. Mr Prokorenko, I'm happy to see you. I'm sorry you're still there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=151.14s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=155.54s)]
*  Rachel, hi. How have the last 72 hours been? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=158.38s)]
*  Well, it's been it's been hard because every time you know it's the bombs are [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=162.78s)]
*  closer. The shots are closer. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=167.24s)]
*  We heard the gunfire every night and you know the mass media is always telling [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=171.16s)]
*  us that it will be an air strike again and again and again. But still, you [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=177.28s)]
*  know, we got used to it. And the thing is we all, you know, became more [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=181.84s)]
*  more united. We became together and we support each other. And this is so good. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=188.56s)]
*  You know, our nation is has never been stronger than before than now. And [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=194.62s)]
*  as you told previously, yes, I went yesterday and there was a huge queues [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=201.62s)]
*  to buy some food. But and we couldn't. But we went to our restaurants. We took [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=207.34s)]
*  some food that we had there. And my friends also from the restaurant business, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=215.74s)]
*  we all walk together and we have some food. We prepare some food for the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=221.32s)]
*  kindergartens, for the hospitals, for for the army. So basically, you know, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  and this time I would say I don't want to leave. This is this is our land and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  we want to stay. We don't want to run away because this is where I belong to. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=238.72s)]
*  This is our [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=243.32s)]
*  home. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=244.61999999999998s)]
*  Homeland. This is Ukraine. This is Kiev. Are you worried about access to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=245.61999999999998s)]
*  basic supplies, to to water, to food, to even for ammunition? It seems like [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=251.22s)]
*  supply lines aren't supply lines aren't there. And so what you've got, you've [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=256.78s)]
*  got. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=260.9s)]
*  Yes, we are worried. But I think I hope and I believe that our president and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=262.74s)]
*  our major will cope with that, you know, because that will be a big problem [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=268.26s)]
*  because yesterday even to the drug stores and and the supermarkets, I [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=273.62s)]
*  couldn't my neighbors got in because we divided what we each have to do. But [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=279.56s)]
*  but we managed to get some to get some food for for the next week. And we'll [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=288.08s)]
*  see what will happen in a week. But there is a lot of garbage on the streets [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=292.88s)]
*  because there is no cleaners and this is and this city looks like a mess. But [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=296.66s)]
*  people, you know, we we strongly believe because of our president's Lensky, he [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=306.70000000000005s)]
*  gives us so much hope because he talks to us and he every time he saying what [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=313.66s)]
*  he did and how he did. And, you know, we're never been stronger than than [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=322.68s)]
*  before. And I would say, you know, let's need to join us, not us join NATO. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=327.56s)]
*  I think that sentiment is something that a lot of people can identify with right [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  now. Alexander, I know it's five in the morning right now, and this is a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=340.8s)]
*  stressful time. But I'm going to warn you right now that we're going to keep [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=344.12s)]
*  asking you to come back to keep us updated on on you and your family and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=346.76000000000005s)]
*  your friends. Godspeed. Good luck. Thank you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=349.72s)]
*  Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBI1ho5RQTA&t=352.66s)]
