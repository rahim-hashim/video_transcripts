# Heedless Russian Military Risks Catastrophe With Ukraine Nuclear Plants
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4)
*  Joining us now is James Acton. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=1.6s)]
*  at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=3.68s)]
*  Mr. Acton, I appreciate you taking the time [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  to be with us tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=7.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=9.76s)]
*  I'm not an expert on these things. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=12.16s)]
*  I am a lay observer, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=13.8s)]
*  just trying to sort of absorb this information. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=15.0s)]
*  You are an expert. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=17.16s)]
*  Let me just ask you if I described any of that wrong [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=18.0s)]
*  or if I got any of it the wrong way around. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=20.36s)]
*  No, I think that was a very good picture, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=23.84s)]
*  a very good summary of the nuclear situation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  on the ground at the moment. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=28.04s)]
*  My primary concern is about the nuclear power plant [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=30.16s)]
*  that Russia is currently occupying at Zaporizhzhia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=33.88s)]
*  That's an operating plant. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=38.4s)]
*  It needs much more active cooling than Chernobyl does. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=39.72s)]
*  The spent fuel on the site is much more highly radioactive. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=43.0s)]
*  It's not surrounded by a large exclusion zone. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=46.44s)]
*  So Russia's behavior at Chernobyl was reckless. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  It was dangerous. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=53.08s)]
*  But I think the big immediate nuclear power accident [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  at risk during this war [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=59.4s)]
*  has always been the operating plants. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=60.92s)]
*  And fortunately, Russia has now left Chernobyl, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=63.32s)]
*  albeit in a much worse state than it found it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=66.24s)]
*  But as you importantly pointed out, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=70.48s)]
*  Zaporizhzhia is still under occupation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=72.12s)]
*  And Zaporizhzhia, forgive my pronunciation, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=75.56s)]
*  that's as close as I can get. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  It is a gigantic plant. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=79.32s)]
*  It is currently operating. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=80.56s)]
*  And as you say, one of the imperatives there [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=81.8s)]
*  for a currently operating plant is active cooling. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=85.4s)]
*  For a plant that generates a lot of power, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=88.88s)]
*  it also needs to have a power source [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=90.48s)]
*  that allows it to actively and constantly cool [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=93.36s)]
*  the hot fuel rods that are a byproduct [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=97.0s)]
*  of the production of nuclear power at a facility like this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=99.92s)]
*  In a war zone like Ukraine, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=102.6s)]
*  especially one that's grinding on into this many days of war [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=104.2s)]
*  with this kind of artillery-driven combat, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=107.08s)]
*  it seems like keeping the power on for a big plant like that, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=109.68s)]
*  or for any of the nuclear power plants in Ukraine, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=112.68s)]
*  is not at all a sure thing. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=114.76s)]
*  And that that alone could potentially [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=116.44s)]
*  be a very dangerous thing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=118.4s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, under normal conditions, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=123.0s)]
*  an accident at a nuclear power plant is very unlikely [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=124.88s)]
*  because you have all of these different safety systems [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=129.0s)]
*  in place. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=132.64s)]
*  So you have an electricity grid connection [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=133.68s)]
*  to provide energy to the cooling. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=137.16s)]
*  You have multiple electricity grid connections. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=138.72s)]
*  If they fail, you have emergency backup, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=141.48s)]
*  diesel generators. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=143.64s)]
*  You often have other kinds of batteries on the plant. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=145.36s)]
*  The problem is in a war, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  a failure of all of these different systems together [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  becomes much more likely than it does in peacetime. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=154.0s)]
*  You know, you can easily imagine a fire starting in a war, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  which is in fact what we saw at Zaporizhzhia [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=160.52s)]
*  a month or so ago. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  You can imagine that fire knocks out the grid connection. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  It could threaten emergency diesel generators. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Under normal circumstances, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  you could have fire crews come to the plant [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=172.32s)]
*  to try to put out the fire. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=175.92s)]
*  But when that happened a few months ago, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=177.6s)]
*  we saw those firefighters were literally shot at. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=180.12s)]
*  They couldn't get to the plant for a while. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=183.0s)]
*  Now, fortunately, the fire that we saw a month or so ago [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  was in an auxiliary building, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=187.84s)]
*  wasn't in the actual reactor itself. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=189.2s)]
*  But given that Zaporizhzhia is illegally occupied [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  at the moment, like other parts of Ukraine, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=195.28s)]
*  it's hardly, seems that unlikely we could see [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=197.76s)]
*  renewed fighting around that plant. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=201.0s)]
*  And deliberately or inadvertently, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=203.72s)]
*  one could imagine damage to that plant or a fire [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=206.8s)]
*  or damage to power supplies or cooling systems [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=212.48s)]
*  that led to a serious accident [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=217.52s)]
*  because all of these different layers of defense [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=219.56s)]
*  that are normally in place around a nuclear power plant. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=221.72s)]
*  And that under normal circumstances, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=227.16s)]
*  simultaneous failures, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=229.0s)]
*  all of these different cooling systems, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=230.16s)]
*  all of these different safety systems [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=231.72s)]
*  would be very unlikely. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=233.44s)]
*  It's much more imaginable in a war [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  that you could have this kind of series [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=236.56s)]
*  of cascading failures leading to a serious accident. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=238.08s)]
*  I think that Vladimir Putin has proven himself [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=240.88s)]
*  to be unpredictable and that he's proven [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=242.72s)]
*  to be willing to do things [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  that were previously thought of as unthinkable. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=246.84s)]
*  Today, I'm conscious of the fact [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=250.16s)]
*  that the Finnish parliament in Finland, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=251.8s)]
*  they just started debating [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=253.8s)]
*  whether or not they're gonna join NATO. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=254.68s)]
*  That's one of the things where he threatened [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=256.2s)]
*  that he would put nuclear weapons more in play, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=257.96s)]
*  put nuclear weapons in the Baltics, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=259.76s)]
*  if Finland and perhaps Sweden think about joining NATO. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=261.68s)]
*  We also saw this test of the very highly touted test [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=265.08s)]
*  of a presumably new type of nuclear weapon today by Russia. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=268.68s)]
*  CNN today quoted US officials saying [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=273.28s)]
*  they're more concerned about the threat of Russia [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=275.64s)]
*  using nuclear weapons than at any time since the Cold War. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=277.56s)]
*  How do you feel about that risk [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=281.0s)]
*  as somebody who studies these things for a living? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  I absolutely cannot rule out [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=284.92s)]
*  the possibility of Russian nuclear use. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=286.92s)]
*  I am less worried about this than I was a month or two back. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=290.0s)]
*  At the beginning of war, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=294.32s)]
*  you remember that first Sunday of the war, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=295.76s)]
*  Putin came out and made a very explicit nuclear threat. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=297.32s)]
*  And I was pretty nervous at that point, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  not about immediate Russian nuclear use, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=304.44s)]
*  but about the possibility of nuclear escalation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=306.56s)]
*  I can't exclude that possibility today. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=311.0s)]
*  But the war has progressed in a way [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=313.88s)]
*  that makes me think it's less likely [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=315.92s)]
*  than it was a month or so ago. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=318.24s)]
*  Putin has scaled back his war aims. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=322.32s)]
*  He's now mostly focusing on east of Ukraine, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  which means that he has, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=329.08s)]
*  if you scale down your aims and you don't achieve them, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=332.92s)]
*  the gap there is not as big as if he'd been continuing [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=337.52s)]
*  to go after the whole of Ukraine. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=340.4s)]
*  I think another condition that would make him more likely [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=342.84s)]
*  to use nuclear weapons is if his hold on power [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  was seriously threatened. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=347.52s)]
*  We're not seeing that at the moment. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=349.11999999999995s)]
*  He still appears to be very popular in Russia [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=350.76s)]
*  because he has complete control of the media, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  but nonetheless. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=355.2s)]
*  And the Russian economy, while it's in a bad state, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=357.84s)]
*  it doesn't appear to be on the verge of complete collapse. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=360.44s)]
*  So I think from Putin's perspective, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=365.52s)]
*  I think he absolutely realizes that using nuclear weapons [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  would be a risky and dangerous thing to do. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=372.32000000000005s)]
*  And I think he would only use them [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=375.0s)]
*  if he thought the risks of using them [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=376.44s)]
*  were smaller than the risks of not using them [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  because the consequences of not using them [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  were so dire in his opinion. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=382.0s)]
*  I think the good news is we're not all that close [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=383.88000000000005s)]
*  to that position today. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=386.16s)]
*  Now, none of this detracts from Putin's exceptionally [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=387.8s)]
*  reckless and dangerous behavior of Russian forces, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=391.0s)]
*  the nuclear saber rattling that we're continuing to see [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=393.92s)]
*  in the form of the test of the new ICBM today. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=396.6s)]
*  But I am somewhat less worried than I was a month or so ago [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=400.52s)]
*  about the possibility of Russian nuclear use. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQmceUSwF4&t=403.71999999999997s)]
