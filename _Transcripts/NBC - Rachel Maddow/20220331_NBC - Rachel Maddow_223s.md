# DOJ Reportedly Investigating 'Officials In Donald Trump's Orbit' Tied To January 6th
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0)
*  Well, joining us now is Devlin Barrett, who was the lead byline on yesterday's Washington Post story, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=0.0s)]
*  which first broke the news that the Justice Department is branching out in its January 6th [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=5.28s)]
*  investigation. Devlin, good to see you. Thank you for joining us. Your reporting is that the subpoena [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=9.84s)]
*  requests have gone out in the past two months to what your officials describe or what you describe [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=15.52s)]
*  as officials in former President Donald Trump's orbit. What do we make that? What do you take that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=20.8s)]
*  to mean? Who are these officials? Could they include members of his administration, they close [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=27.12s)]
*  associates, financial backers? Well, I think the way to think about this set of information demands [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=31.68s)]
*  is that they're looking for what everyone's role was in January 6th. Remember, there's a lot of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=40.24s)]
*  different things happening on January 6th, and part of the challenge for investigators is unpacking [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=46.8s)]
*  all the different pieces and seeing how all those different pieces work together. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=51.68s)]
*  So obviously, I think this was a long-awaited step. Obviously, you mentioned that there has been some [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=56.08s)]
*  criticism of the Justice Department for not doing this type of thing sooner, but I think there was [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=62.08s)]
*  an expectation that they would eventually get here. It's just, you know, for some folks not in the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=67.6s)]
*  Justice Department, they think they could have done it sooner than they did. But really, what they're [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=72.4s)]
*  trying to do is they're trying to essentially broaden the picture of all the activity on January [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=76.16s)]
*  6th, and frankly, the activity before January 6th is becoming more and more important to investigators. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=81.28s)]
*  We know that the committee met virtually for six hours with Jared Kushner. What do we know about [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=88.88s)]
*  what happened there? So we haven't heard a lot about that. One thing to keep in mind, and I think [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=95.12s)]
*  this sometimes gets a little confusing because there are so many different arms of the government, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=101.2s)]
*  is the committee's work is very different from the criminal investigation, and it's pretty unusual [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=104.96s)]
*  to have a full-throated committee congressional investigation going on at the same exact time [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  as the criminal DOJ FBI investigation. That's fairly unusual, even in sort of the hyperactive [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  world of Washington the way it is now, and I think some of the tension points you're seeing and some [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  of the distrust or confusion or concern you're seeing is because those two forces are rarely [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  in play at the same time, and there's not a great deal of understanding or information sharing between [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=134.64s)]
*  those two things. And there's been some very vocal criticism, particularly by members of the January [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=139.6s)]
*  6th committee, about what the Department of Justice is or isn't doing. What's your sense of it? Are [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=148.16s)]
*  they starting to converge? Are they working on parallel tracks? And is the Department of Justice, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  as you mentioned, possibly responding to that criticism? Or is this just unfolding the way the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=158.88s)]
*  Department of Justice was going to see it unfold? I think the Department is very much aware of the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=163.52s)]
*  criticism, but I think one way to the best way to think about this is parallel tracks. The other [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  thing to keep in mind is that the Justice Department investigations tend to go much slower than the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=174.24s)]
*  public or the Congress expects or wants them to go. So I think there's, I don't think this tension [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=179.44s)]
*  is going away, especially because the committee is trying to wrap up its work this spring and early [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  summer. But I do think you're going to see essentially parallel courses going through this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=189.52s)]
*  process. And I think you're going to see more and more indications that the Justice Department is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  looking at some of these things that are of concern to the committee, that are of concern to the public, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=202.56s)]
*  but they're going to do it at their own pace. And I don't think the criticism that that's not fast [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=207.28s)]
*  enough, I think that criticism will stay there. But obviously, this indication is a big step forward [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  in a lot of people's minds in the direction they wanted to see the Justice Department going. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDoAKvCapp0&t=217.84s)]
