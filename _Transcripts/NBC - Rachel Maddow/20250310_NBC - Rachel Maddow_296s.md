# Republicans struggle to answer for Trump, Musk to alarmed constituents back home
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs)
*  And this is an interesting one. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a Republican. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=1.92s)]
*  In Western Michigan, Republican Congressman Bill Hizenga—I think that's how you say [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=3.68s)]
*  his name. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  It's H-U-I-Z-E-N-G-A, Hizenga. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=8.52s)]
*  He held a tele-town hall this weekend with his constituents. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=12.06s)]
*  He actually told his constituents on the call that he didn't want to do an in-person town [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=15.56s)]
*  hall because he thought people would be disruptive if he showed up in person. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  So he just did it by phone. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=23.92s)]
*  And still, even though it was just on the phone, that still led to his local ABC affiliate [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=26.16s)]
*  in Western Michigan getting him on the record and on tape from that tele-town hall with [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=32.24s)]
*  this. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=38.4s)]
*  Take a listen to what one person asked and how he in part responded. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=41.22s)]
*  I've got a lot of angst. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=45.8s)]
*  Hopefully, I'm hoping the Congress will stand up and say, yes, you are allowed to do this, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=48.8s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=56.36s)]
*  No, Mr. President, this has to go through Congress. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=57.36s)]
*  Is that something that Congress is willing to do? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=58.36s)]
*  I will fully admit, I think Elon Musk has tweeted first and thought second sometimes [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=61.12s)]
*  and has plunged ahead without necessarily knowing and understanding what he legally [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  has to do or what he is going to be doing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=76.12s)]
*  The actions of Donald Trump and Elon Musk are indefensible, according to Republican [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=82.24s)]
*  members of Congress, and they do not want to have to admit that on camera in front of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  their constituents. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  But I think that's a good point. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  But I think that's a good point. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  And they do not want to have to admit that on camera in front of their constituents, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=107.84s)]
*  let alone face them eyeball to eyeball. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=112.84s)]
*  But doing a tele town hall still gets you on tape, even when you're just there on the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=115.84s)]
*  phone. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=120.84s)]
*  In Kansas this weekend, Republican Congressman Ron Estes thought that he figured out how [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=123.84s)]
*  to fix this problem. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=126.84s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=128.84s)]
*  Congressman Estes called for a rally. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=129.84s)]
*  He called for a big pro-Trump rally and protest event in his district, and it was to be sponsored [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  by a right-wing group called Americans for Prosperity. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  So this event, it was Saturday in Wichita, Kansas, again, called by the congressman to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  telling his constituents to show up to protest for Donald Trump. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  And the event was drowned out by a much larger group of anti-Trump protesters who showed [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  up to protest against Donald Trump and also against their congressman Ron Estes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=160.44s)]
*  If you look at any of the signs, you'll see something, everything from protect DEI to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=165.44s)]
*  protect women, to help Ukraine. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=171.44s)]
*  It's just a little bit of everything all at once. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=174.44s)]
*  Defend Democracy organizers use the rally as a lightning rod, aiming to express their [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=179.44s)]
*  opposition to state leaders on a variety of topics. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=183.44s)]
*  The DEI, who said, you know, the firing of so many people for no reason, the park rangers. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=187.24s)]
*  Arguing that the job cuts by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=194.24s)]
*  Efficiency are only hurting Kansans. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=198.74s)]
*  Again, that was supposed to be the pro-Trump event. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=201.74s)]
*  Dang nabbit! [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=205.74s)]
*  Republican Congressman Ron Estes of Kansas trying to get people to rally for Trump, trying [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=208.24s)]
*  to get some good press for the Republicans and Trump, but then the number of people who [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=213.24s)]
*  turn out in Kansas to protest against him and against Trump just totally dwarfs what [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=217.24s)]
*  he was trying to do. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=221.24s)]
*  Let me just show you like one more little 10 second blip of this. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=222.24s)]
*  This is the very end of that local news package on KSN in Kansas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=225.24s)]
*  Congressman Estes, how'd it go trying to get some good press for your pro-Trump event [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=230.24s)]
*  that was totally swamped by anti-Trump protesters? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=234.24s)]
*  How did it go? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=238.24s)]
*  We intended to speak to Ron Estes, but he left the rally before addressing the media [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=241.24s)]
*  present. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=245.24s)]
*  Here for you, Peyton Steiner, KSN News 3. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=246.24s)]
*  Republican Congressman Ron Estes of Kansas, step one, invite the media. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=249.24s)]
*  Step two, forget that your own constituents are horrified at Donald Trump and looking [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=254.24s)]
*  for any opportunity to protest him. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=259.24s)]
*  Step three, leave without talking to the media. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=261.24s)]
*  Very important. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=265.24s)]
*  Hope that they forget that you are the one who invited them to be there, to show off [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=267.24s)]
*  all the Trump love in your district. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKL1gnzdsJs&t=272.24s)]
