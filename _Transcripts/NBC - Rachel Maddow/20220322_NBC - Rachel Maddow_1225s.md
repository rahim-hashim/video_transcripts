# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 21
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ)
*  Joining us now live from Keeve is NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel Richard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for your excellent report and the excellent reporting that you continue to do [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=4.84s)]
*  I do want to get a sense you're on the ground. You're seeing how some of these [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=8.1s)]
*  These fights and resistance are going on the ground and you also have [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=13.14s)]
*  access to this high-level [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=18.0s)]
*  Evaluation that there's a stalemate. Tell me tell me how you evaluate that statement against what you're seeing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=20.22s)]
*  So right now we're seeing two kinds of resistance [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=25.5s)]
*  We're seeing military resistance, which is so far keeping Russian forces from Keeve [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=29.580000000000002s)]
*  Russian forces have been kept back to the northern [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=36.02s)]
*  Suburbs of the city and they have not been able to advance in days [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=40.260000000000005s)]
*  So we're seeing conventional military resistance and we're also seeing civil disobedience. We're seeing that in herson and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=43.42s)]
*  Herson is one of the only places where Russians actually [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=51.42s)]
*  Occupy the the city they patrol they patrol on foot. They've [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=55.260000000000005s)]
*  Imposed a kind of shadow government, but people are not accepting it and herson was considered one of the more [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=60.46s)]
*  Pro-russian communities here before this war began [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=67.86s)]
*  And I think this was one of the things that Vladimir Putin was counting on there were deep divides here [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=71.38s)]
*  There were divides between East and West and then there was a lot of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=76.14s)]
*  Deep divides here there were divides between East and West there were divides between [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=79.02s)]
*  Those who spoke Russian and those who speak? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=82.89999999999999s)]
*  Native Ukrainian and herson was considered the closest to Russia [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=85.86s)]
*  As is as was Mariupol, but if you look at what's happening in Mariupol, and if you look at what is happening in herson right now [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=91.3s)]
*  There's real hatred for Russia people are [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=98.97999999999999s)]
*  Swearing blood oaths. They are leaving the city if they can they're being strip searched when they're leaving Mariupol [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=102.78s)]
*  As the guards check to see if they have some sort of Nazi [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=109.02s)]
*  Insignia tattooed swastikas tattooed on their body and in herson. They're standing up to gunfire [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  so the Russian plan both from a [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  Hearts and minds campaign if you will [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=124.38s)]
*  Plan to occupy and easily pacify areas that were thought to be pro-russia [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=126.86s)]
*  That's not working and it's conventional military plan to drive into the cities is not working for now [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=131.5s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit more about Mariupol at this point [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=139.02s)]
*  There's been an offer or request by Russia that Ukraine simply cede Mariupol the Ukrainians have rejected that offer [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=141.98000000000002s)]
*  but the idea that that may be [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=149.46s)]
*  The Vladimir Putin is giving up on the idea of taking Kiev and the government and instead would be satisfied by more [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=152.38s)]
*  territorial gains [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=159.94s)]
*  Explain that to us give me some context around that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=161.34s)]
*  So [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=164.42s)]
*  Throughout this conflict we've been guessing about Vladimir Putin's intentions and unfortunately [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=166.42s)]
*  We've often been guessing them incorrectly [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=171.7s)]
*  There was a camp that thought that Vladimir Putin wouldn't invade that camp included the Ukrainian government and included President Zelensky [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=174.06s)]
*  By the way, who thought right until the end that Russia wasn't going to launch a full-scale invasion [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=180.7s)]
*  Then there was a camp that maybe Putin would take a piece that he would just take the Dombass or Mariupol [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=186.33999999999997s)]
*  Dombass or maybe he would take a land bridge to Crimea now if he wants a land bridge to Crimea [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=192.7s)]
*  That would be able to connect the territory of Russia to the Crimean Peninsula [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=199.98s)]
*  Which Russia annexed after it took it over in 2014 [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=204.29999999999998s)]
*  Then he would have to take the city of Mariupol and herson and a few other areas in that in that southern region [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=209.22s)]
*  along the Black Coast and the Sea of Azov [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=216.54s)]
*  From Putin's perspective that would give him a win it would allow him to secure [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=219.26s)]
*  Crimea and secure the water supply to Crimea which which also flows through that area [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=225.26s)]
*  but is that going to be enough and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=231.01999999999998s)]
*  If people misjudged Putin the first time I think we would be [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=233.5s)]
*  Foolish to allow ourselves to be fooled twice and assume that he would just be satisfied [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=239.1s)]
*  With a slice in the east especially when his troops are continuing to dig in there's new satellite images show that the troops are still [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=245.1s)]
*  Mobilizing around the borders of this country particularly up in the north of Belarus [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=254.66s)]
*  So it is not at all clear that he wants to only take Mariupol and would somehow be satisfied with that and walk away [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=259.02s)]
*  I think those calculations we were having those one of the other things in the beginning [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=266.94s)]
*  But now that he is in this war it's not clear [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=271.42s)]
*  So let's talk about in the beginning there was also a calculation and and potentially not officially [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=274.54s)]
*  But we heard there may have been an offer or a plan by the us to get [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=281.74s)]
*  Vladimir Zelensky out of Kiev either to western Ukraine a place like Lviv or somewhere else that might have been safer [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=285.18s)]
*  Or even to Poland to have a government in exile [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  He refused to leave Kiev as did his members of parliament and government government officials [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  And Kiev still stands and they are still in Kiev and you are still in kiev [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=299.98s)]
*  We do know that there continue to be assaults on that city. There was a deadly assault overnight at a shopping mall [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  What is the situation on the ground where you are in kiev? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=310.22s)]
*  So [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=316.14000000000004s)]
*  There was also a big intelligence failure that I think we should acknowledge that the us [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=317.66s)]
*  Correctly predicted that Vladimir Putin would do some sort of invasion [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=322.54s)]
*  But they the the intelligence failure was that they thought the ukrainian government was going to imminently collapse and that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=327.58s)]
*  Zelensky would have to become some charles de gaulle figure operating in exile when now he is still here and he's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  leading an effective resistance [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=341.02s)]
*  You asked about the mood here in kiev. It is a very strange city right now [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=343.34s)]
*  There are two million people here according to the mayor give or take [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=348.46s)]
*  I think most of them are men because men are not allowed to leave this country [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=351.34s)]
*  If you notice where you are the lots of the refugees it's it's women children and and the elderly [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=356.21999999999997s)]
*  The men are still here [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=362.06s)]
*  There's there's no real work. So to speak. Nothing is open [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=364.14s)]
*  Uh, there's not the ability to shop so you have lots of men in their houses with no families [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=368.3s)]
*  Living presumably on crackers and salami. There's no alcohol in the city. The whole city has been declared dry by the mayor [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=374.46s)]
*  Everyone is participating in in some form in civil defense [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=381.42s)]
*  people walk around in [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=387.26s)]
*  sort of militarized clothing with colored armbands around their around their [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=389.26s)]
*  Upper arm either yellow or blue to show that they're loyal to the to the army. There's checkpoints on the streets [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=394.78s)]
*  Uh, you ask you're asked for your papers every time you go through a checkpoint or often when you go through a checkpoint [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=401.34s)]
*  It is a it [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=407.82s)]
*  Harkens back to an earlier time when you are asked to see your papers [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=409.58000000000004s)]
*  Every time every place you go in a city full of men bracing for war [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=414.14s)]
*  NATO allies are set to meet this week [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=420.3s)]
*  likely against the backdrop of a protected uh, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=423.34000000000003s)]
*  Protracted war in ukraine that will put considerably more ukrainian [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  Civilian lives at risk and it's a war that ukrainian president zelensky is arguing could have been avoided altogether [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=430.85999999999996s)]
*  Saying this weekend that quote if we were a nato member a war wouldn't have started [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=438.06s)]
*  And further calling on nato to give ukraine some sort of clarity as to whether or not they will ever ever be able to join [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=443.02s)]
*  the alliance [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=449.34s)]
*  Joining us now is heather connelly president of the german martial fund [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=450.53999999999996s)]
*  She's also a former deputy assistant secretary of state for europe and eurasian affairs where she co-led [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=453.65999999999997s)]
*  The us interagency effort to enlarge nato heather good to see you. Thank you for joining us again [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=460.14s)]
*  Certainly the growth of nato [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=465.82s)]
*  In the beginning and then subsequent to the collapse of the warsaw pact and the the fall of the berlin wall [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=468.7s)]
*  It's not clear. I think to most of our viewers how these former warsaw pact countries came to be nato [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=474.29999999999995s)]
*  Countries and and why some of them didn't but what's the what's the the cliff's notes version of that? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=480.85999999999996s)]
*  And and what zelensky is asking for let us in now [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=487.02s)]
*  Well, the cliff notes is uh, the washington treaty which established the north atlantic treaty organization in 1949 [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=491.41999999999996s)]
*  There's an article article 10 that says [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=499.65999999999997s)]
*  A membership is available and open to those european countries that can assume the responsibilities [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=503.02s)]
*  Of becoming a nato member. So this is why nato enlargement has [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=510.85999999999996s)]
*  Proceeded since 1949 up to now 30 members of nato [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=516.06s)]
*  Obviously as nato expanded it becomes more challenging to make decisions at 30 [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=522.06s)]
*  But it is a strong and vibrant alliance now the members that want to join nato [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=527.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes nato members have to accept them and we closely scrutinize every aspirant country's [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=534.14s)]
*  Application they have to have a strong defense. They have to have um, you know strong democracies [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=542.06s)]
*  And being able to accept the responsibility [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=549.02s)]
*  So it's not just a let us in it is a process [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=551.98s)]
*  But it is open to all european countries that can accept those responsibilities [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=555.26s)]
*  So the thing is it's very difficult to bring in a member [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=560.4599999999999s)]
*  When you have such a dramatic situation at hand [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=564.62s)]
*  But I will tell you what what vladimir putin is doing is making more countries want to join nato neutral countries like sweden [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=568.0600000000001s)]
*  Like finland because the russians are really threatening their freedom of choice to to join alliances [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=575.1800000000001s)]
*  So the more threatening vladimir putin becomes the more countries that want to seek the security umbrella [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=580.94s)]
*  Of nato so he's creating these conditions in 2014 the ukrainian constitution [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=588.14s)]
*  Ensured that ukraine was a neutral country by annexing crimea and invading don boston 2014 [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  It was vladimir putin who forced the ukrainian [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=600.0s)]
*  Government to change its constitution to want to be more closely aligned with nato [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=602.9599999999999s)]
*  So again, moskow has to accept its strategic failures the more it takes these actions the more countries want to join nato [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  That was such a great crystal clear explanation about why countries join how they join [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=616.4799999999999s)]
*  So and thank you for that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=622.0s)]
*  But now I want to get your reaction to the other thing that president zelensky said over the weekend arguing that quote [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  If we were a nato member this war would not have started those were his words. Is he right? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=628.16s)]
*  Would this war never have taken place? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=633.76s)]
*  Would russia have just not done it not gone across a border if ukraine were a nato member because really the second part of my [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=636.0s)]
*  Question is that countries like i'm in poland really do fear russian expansionism and they feel that if they get away with ukraine [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=642.64s)]
*  The russians could just continue to move further west or northwest and take other countries. Is that possible? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=648.96s)]
*  Well, I think there is some truth to what president zelensky said because you look at the three baltic states of estonia latvia, lithuania [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=655.6s)]
*  Poland is another example when these countries joined nato [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  Uh, they they did have a strong sense of of defense of deterrence of reassurance [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=667.36s)]
*  That should russia become the russia that it is today an aggressor state a revisionist state [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=674.42s)]
*  They would be protected. This is what president zelensky is asking for ukraine right now the challenges ali [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=680.1s)]
*  It's the geopolitical conditions that allow [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=686.9s)]
*  This membership to proceed so we had us two geostrategic openings [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=690.18s)]
*  particularly in 1999 that brought in poland hungary and the czech republic in [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=695.4599999999999s)]
*  2002 the nato enlargement round that I was involved in it brought in the three baltic states as well as slovenia slovakia romania bulgaria [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=700.02s)]
*  NATO has continued to enlarge even past that point, but it was that we had that opportunity to do it [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=708.18s)]
*  But now we have a very different russia and so we have to bring that into consideration [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=714.42s)]
*  But look nato enlargement is not done that geopolitical window will open and this is where we have to have the closest possible [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=719.14s)]
*  Relationship between nato and ukraine between nato and other [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=726.6600000000001s)]
*  former soviet states like the republic of georgia because when that geopolitical window opens [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=731.62s)]
*  We want their candidacy to be strong them to be in the best position [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=737.7800000000001s)]
*  Uh for for nato and the european union if that's possible to to continue to expand eastward [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=742.34s)]
*  That's what mr. Putin fears. This is really not though ali. Let me be very clear. It's not about membership in nato [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=748.4200000000001s)]
*  It's not membership in the european union what latimer putin fears is the freedom of choice and the dignity of the individual [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=754.82s)]
*  He cannot allow that in russia and retain his power if if ukraine becomes a thriving prosperous and secure [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=762.74s)]
*  democracy that is his greatest threat and membership in nato or membership in the european union just [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=770.8000000000001s)]
*  Represents that freedom of choice and that dignity and that is what mr [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=777.0400000000001s)]
*  Putin will not allow to stand in ukraine and he's trying to destroy ukraine before he allows them to join that family of democracies [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=781.0600000000001s)]
*  President linden b johnson nominated constance baker motley to the federal judiciary in january 1966 [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=791.38s)]
*  By the end of that summer she became the first black woman to serve on the federal bench in the history of the united states [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=797.7s)]
*  But by that point judge baker motley had decades of experience litigating civil rights cases [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=803.38s)]
*  While working as the only woman lawyer at the n-double a cp legal defense and education fund [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=809.62s)]
*  She was the protege of third good marshal who of course went on to become the first black supreme court justice [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=814.6600000000001s)]
*  She wrote the original complaint in brown versus board of education [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=820.74s)]
*  She represented clients like martin luther king jr after his arrest in birmingham in 1963 [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=824.26s)]
*  And the more than 1 000 students who skipped class to protest segregation in birmingham under the threat of police violence [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=830.34s)]
*  Motley was the first black woman to argue cases before the supreme court. She did it 10 times [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=837.3s)]
*  She won nine of those 10 times [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=842.1s)]
*  And that is the story legal legacy that president biden's supreme court nominee judge katanji brown jackson invoked today [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=844.66s)]
*  When she spoke to the senate judiciary committee on day one of her confirmation hearings [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=852.02s)]
*  During this hearing [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=858.18s)]
*  I hope that you will see [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=859.86s)]
*  How much I love our country? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=862.18s)]
*  And the constitution and the rights that make us free [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=865.62s)]
*  I stand on the shoulders of so many who have come before me [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=873.06s)]
*  including judge constants baker motley [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=878.8199999999999s)]
*  Who was the first african-american woman to be appointed to the federal bench and with whom I share a birthday? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=882.1s)]
*  And like judge motley [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=890.02s)]
*  I have dedicated my career [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=892.42s)]
*  To ensuring that the words engraved on the front of the supreme court building equal justice under law [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=894.9s)]
*  Are a reality [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=903.3s)]
*  And not just an ideal [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=905.22s)]
*  Judge katanji brown jackson the first black woman nominated to the supreme court spoke to the committee for 10 minutes about her personal [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=911.06s)]
*  And professional background and her dedication to equal justice under the law [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=917.78s)]
*  She spoke only after several hours of remarks by committee members [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=921.7s)]
*  Which featured some prominent republicans lobbing a range of critiques as she sat quietly listening [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=925.22s)]
*  There were complaints about her previous work as a public defender her membership on a school board [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=930.34s)]
*  And the fact that president biden did not choose a different black woman to be his nominee [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=935.0600000000001s)]
*  Other senators reminded the room that judge jackson had stood before the committee before [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=939.78s)]
*  She faced senate confirmation hearings in 2009 for her nomination to the u.s [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=944.18s)]

*  Uh, I i'm trying to get a sense from these people who you've talked to who are out of mary opal [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1049.96s)]
*  What life must be like for those who are inside and for whom we cannot bear witness right now [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1055.24s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean the people we spoke to are the lucky few they're people who had [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1060.1200000000001s)]
*  Personal vehicles and were able to actually make it out of the city [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1066.04s)]
*  Humanitarian corridors have broken down time and again [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1070.5s)]
*  And so you haven't seen an organized full-scale evacuation that's allowed the majority of the population out [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1073.72s)]
*  Everyone we spoke to had been sheltering in basements with dozens of other people [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1080.68s)]
*  Who stayed behind because they didn't have cars and they didn't have a way out and and as you you said [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1085.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, they described to us flushing out their heating systems to get access to water [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1091.0s)]
*  Um, you know going to springs melting snow [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1095.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, and and the people we spoke to all said that food stocks were really dwindling when they left other [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1099.72s)]
*  People behind in the basements they had been sheltering in you you wonder when this is going to end and you hope it's going [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1106.84s)]
*  To be better [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1111.7199999999998s)]
*  But in mary opal we have a situation in which there's not the availability of water and it is winter and people don't have heating [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1112.1999999999998s)]
*  They don't have power [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1119.08s)]

*  Absolutely, and I think the the point that you make about those left behind and and and how they're affected [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1130.76s)]
*  Particularly by the lack of electricity is is significant for those people that we interviewed most of them [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1135.8600000000001s)]
*  Before they made it out spent two weeks hiding in basements and sheltering from this ongoing shelling all around them [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1143.72s)]
*  Um, just hoping that they wouldn't be injured and they you know, eventually would be able to make it out [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1151.88s)]
*  The most haunting stories that that I heard were actually from older people and people with disabilities [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1157.0s)]
*  For these people they they couldn't make it down to the basement. So they were in their apartment buildings [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1163.56s)]
*  I spoke to a man in his 80s who was on his six-floor [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1169.4799999999998s)]
*  Apartments, uh another couple who were uh on a third in a third floor apartment [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1173.06s)]
*  And for them there was no way down and and they described to me how they essentially spent those two weeks [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1177.7199999999998s)]
*  Sitting on their couch, uh in a room with uh blown out windows [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1183.72s)]
*  So nothing blocking the cold outside as you said it was below zero degrees celsius [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1187.88s)]
*  And and they were sitting there freezing and they were just watching the bombs [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1194.04s)]
*  And the explosions going off outside of their windows absolutely terrified that any moment would be their last [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1198.36s)]
*  You [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVequ5jm7IQ&t=1213.24s)]
