# Why are some crimes described by Bragg not among Trump's charges?
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0)
*  The indictment doesn't specify that because the law does not so require. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=0.0s)]
*  In my remarks, I mentioned a couple of laws which I will highlight again now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=3.84s)]
*  The first is New York State election law, which makes it a crime to conspire to promote [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=9.84s)]
*  a candidacy by unlawful means. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=16.06s)]
*  I further indicated a number of unlawful means, including more additional false statements, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=19.36s)]
*  including statements that were planned to be made to tax authorities. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=25.28s)]
*  I also noted the federal election law cap on contribution limits. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=29.52s)]
*  I'm not going to go into our deliberate process on what was brought. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=35.24s)]
*  The charges that were brought were the ones that were brought. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=38.56s)]
*  The evidence in the law is the basis for those decisions. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=40.64s)]
*  Ahead of the indictment today being brought against former President Donald Trump, we [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=44.56s)]
*  had an unpretty good authority. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=48.8s)]
*  Everybody had pretty well surmised that there were going to be multiple charges related [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  to falsified business records. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=54.32s)]
*  But we all learned in Crash Course Cable TV Law School that in addition to those charges, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=56.92s)]
*  there needed to be something that made those charges into a felony. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  On their own terms, those things would just be misdemeanors. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=66.64s)]
*  Those things would not likely therefore result in Donald Trump being indicted. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=69.48s)]
*  If he was going to be indicted, those falsified business records would have to be linked to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=72.7s)]
*  the attempt to commit or conceal some other crime. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=77.44s)]
*  Today we found out what the other crimes would be, except those crimes aren't charged today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=81.8s)]
*  We saw Alvin Bragg just run through them briefly in his Remarks News answering questions today [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=88.6s)]
*  from reporters. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=93.36s)]
*  He said under New York state election law, it's a crime to conspire to promote a candidacy [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=94.36s)]
*  by unlawful means. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=99.84s)]
*  He described additional false business records charges, not the ones that were charged against [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=101.36s)]
*  Trump today, but additional false business records that were allegedly carried out by [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  the company that owns the National Enquirer. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=112.92s)]
*  He also described federal election law caps on contributions. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=114.8s)]
*  Again, those were not charged today, but he cited those crimes as being essentially the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=119.08s)]
*  aggravating factor that made the charges against Trump today into felonies. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=124.62s)]
*  How does that work if those crimes he described today were not actually themselves charged? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=130.44s)]
*  I put this question to two of our legal experts who are here with us today, Catherine Christian [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=136.92s)]
*  and Andrew Weissman, both veteran prosecutors who've seen this both from a federal and a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=141.68s)]
*  state perspective. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=146.92s)]
*  Can either of you walk us non-lawyers through this part of these charges? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=148.12s)]
*  You want me to take a crack? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=154.44s)]
*  You go ahead. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=156.72s)]
*  So the first thing to know is that the statute in New York that says you can bump this up [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=158.2s)]
*  to a felony requires that you have an intent to commit some other crime. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=164.64s)]
*  You don't actually have to commit that crime. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=170.76s)]
*  So that's why you wouldn't necessarily need to charge it, and that's something that Alvin [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=173.36s)]
*  Bragg said. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=176.88s)]
*  Also, if one of the crimes that you're thinking can be used as that bump up is a federal crime, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=177.88s)]
*  then that is not something that you could charge in state court anyway. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=184.72s)]
*  Now, this really goes to Chris's question in the last segment where he sort of said, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=188.48s)]
*  isn't this really still a tenuous case? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=193.84s)]
*  Isn't there a problem because this is really a legal issue in this case, more than a factual [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=196.0s)]
*  issue? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=201.28s)]
*  And this is where I actually was impressed in terms of what was charged here because [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=202.28s)]
*  there's so many different ways in which the DA has laid out how he can get to a felony. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=207.32s)]
*  He suggested in his oral remarks that one way is the federal campaign laws. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=214.24s)]
*  Another way is the state campaign laws. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=220.68s)]
*  A third way is he talked about AMI issuing false statements, and this was in furtherance [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  of those false statements. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=230.12s)]
*  And a fourth way was tax charges, exactly what you had laid out, Rachel, in terms of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=231.8s)]
*  have Michael Cohen commit tax fraud, which, by the way, is exactly the kind of thing that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=238.92s)]
*  was alleged in the Trump Organization Weisselberg case that just resulted in convictions in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=245.11999999999998s)]
*  November. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=251.6s)]
*  So those give the DA a lot of room. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=252.6s)]
*  So even if there is an attack on one or two of them, particularly the state crimes of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=256.08s)]
*  tax fraud and the AMI false statement charge seem very solid. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=261.32s)]
*  It seems very hard to imagine a motion to dismiss that's going to knock out all of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=265.36s)]
*  that and reduce all of the charges to misdemeanors. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=270.48s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that the — when you describe, Andrew, the district attorney as [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=274.12s)]
*  having laid out a lot of different paths by which he can get to a felony, sometimes, like, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  when you see that in a movie script or something, you think, oh, they've given you a whole bunch [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=283.5s)]
*  of different options because they don't have one good, strong one. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  But in this case, you're saying that's not a sign of weakness, that's a sign of strength [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=290.0s)]
*  of the case because even if one of them gets knocked out, they've still got other viable [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=293.48s)]
*  means. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=296.48s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=297.48s)]
*  That's when I would charge, and I'm sure Katherine charged, you know, obviously, if [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=298.48s)]
*  you have a really weak one, you don't want to do that and have it sort of taint all of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  the other ones. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=306.32s)]
*  But if you have, like, four really good options, lay them all out. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=307.32s)]
*  The defense is entitled to make motions and to — and you never know what a judge is [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  going to do. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=314.68s)]
*  That's the reason you lay out your strongest ones. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=315.92s)]
*  And here, there are just too many options that I'm sure when the defense looked at [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=319.12s)]
*  this, they were actually thinking this is more than we had sort of bargained for. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGXJJxy8_d0&t=324.24s)]
