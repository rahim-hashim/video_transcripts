# For Hospitalized Children, Escaping Putin's Brutality In Ukraine Carries Extra Peril
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs)
*  My time here in Hungary, I've watched thousands of people pass through, many with harrowing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=0.0s)]
*  stories of having to figure out what and who to leave behind and how to get across the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  border safely. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=9.8s)]
*  But there's another group of displaced and endangered people for whom getting out is [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=10.8s)]
*  even harder and more dangerous. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=15.16s)]
*  I'm talking about the children of Ukraine who are suffering from serious illnesses, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=17.6s)]
*  the children who are undergoing life-saving cancer treatment, and the ones on dialysis, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=21.84s)]
*  the children who need to stick to their treatment regimen in order to survive. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=27.04s)]
*  Dozens of Ukraine's hospitals have been destroyed or badly damaged by Russian bombs, but the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  ones that are standing are overrun. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=36.12s)]
*  There's no infrastructure to care for these children who desperately need complex and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=38.84s)]
*  sustained medical treatment. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=42.76s)]
*  They can't leave with the millions who are fleeing for safety, but they do have one place [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  to go. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=48.42s)]
*  In addition to becoming a safe haven for those fleeing the rest of the country, the city [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=49.56s)]
*  Ukraine is quickly becoming the hub for children seeking special medical care. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=54.26s)]
*  Some of the sickest kids from the eastern part of the country have made it to relative [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=58.94s)]
*  safety in Lviv, with some parents, some of them with parents and some of them without. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=63.22s)]
*  But the hospital is still nearly bursting at the seams. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=67.74s)]
*  NBC News foreign correspondent Molly Hunter visited Western Ukraine's specialized children's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=70.7s)]
*  medical center in Lviv. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=76.44s)]
*  Children's hospital mom Ines, eight-year-old son Danny Lou, was diagnosed with blood cancer [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=80.42s)]
*  on February 5th. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=84.18s)]
*  Then the war started. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=86.18s)]
*  Three days ago, they fled the besieged city of Kharkiv in an ambulance. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  It was full-scale war. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  Everything was bombed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=96.82s)]
*  We were living in the basement all the time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=97.82000000000001s)]
*  What does it feel like as a mother just to have all of this out of your control? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=100.34s)]
*  I have to be strong. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=107.42s)]
*  She says, I'll do whatever it takes to get him the treatment he needs. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=108.92s)]
*  From that children's hospital in Lviv, the children are sent across the border to continue [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=115.36000000000001s)]
*  their treatment, many of them in Poland. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=119.12s)]
*  I want to go now to Julia Nogovitsina, the program director at the Tablektoczki Charity [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=121.28s)]
*  Foundation, which is Ukraine's biggest childhood cancer foundation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=127.12s)]
*  She's been helping coordinate the treatment and evacuation process for these children [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=131.0s)]
*  since the start of the war. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=135.08s)]
*  She joins us live from Lviv. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=136.32s)]
*  Ms. Nogovitsina, thank you for joining us tonight. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's talk about these children. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=142.56s)]
*  What kind of care can you continue to give them and what can you not? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=144.2s)]
*  How do they continue their care that they can't miss for when you can't provide it? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=147.84s)]
*  Hi, thank you for inviting me. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=155.92s)]
*  Yes, indeed, they collect children all over Ukraine from big hospitals and from small [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=157.92s)]
*  villages where they stay as our patients and bring them to Lviv. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=162.96s)]
*  Here in Lviv, they either stay for continuation of their treatment or they just stay for a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=166.88s)]
*  couple of days to have their health conditions stabilized and then they transfer across the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=173.12s)]
*  Polish border to the Polish Triage Center in Kielce, which is a current unicorn clinic, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=178.0s)]
*  for further distribution among the European and North American clinics to have the proper [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=184.48s)]
*  advanced anti-cancer treatment. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=191.52s)]
*  Let's talk about the kinds of people who you need to offer this treatment. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  This is specialized medical work. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=199.84s)]
*  You need specialized supplies. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=201.84s)]
*  Do you have the supplies you need and do you have the people you need [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=203.12s)]
*  to provide the treatment even for a short term in Lviv? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=206.16000000000003s)]
*  Yes, the Lviv hospital is now overcrowded and it's overwhelmed, but they still cope with this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=210.4s)]
*  They stretch their capacities almost to exhaustion, but they cope with this workload. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=216.72s)]
*  Their medical teams are very devoted and they were enforced by some doctors from other parts of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=222.24s)]
*  Ukraine, from Kiev, from Nikolai. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  They just moved to Lviv with their patients and now they send their patients to abroad, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=230.8s)]
*  but they stay here to make this team stronger and they provide all necessary care and treatment [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=236.0s)]
*  to children who arrive every day and night, dozens of children. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=242.88s)]
*  Medical supplies are still available for a short period of time because the hospital had its stock [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=247.12s)]
*  and it has not run out of its stock, but we do need humanitarian assistance with some [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=252.64s)]
*  essential hemophiliac drugs and some antibiotics, antibiotics, and so on. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=259.44s)]
*  Julia, you talked about the kids who go across to Poland. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=267.52s)]
*  Is there a global effort to help these children? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=270.8s)]
*  Is there enough being done or is there more that can be done to make sure that these kids [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=274.24s)]
*  go somewhere, whether it's Poland or somewhere else, to get the continued treatment that they require? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=278.24s)]
*  In childhood cancer, we are so much lucky and so much honored to have such a gorgeous partner [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  as St. Jude Global, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=291.44s)]
*  They are our main international partner who stepped in from the very first day [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=295.12s)]
*  of the war and they developed the logistics mechanism through which we bring children [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  from Lviv to Poland for them being further assessed by the Polish doctors and then triaged [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  to various European clinics. The network of these international hospitals who are ready to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=314.64s)]
*  admit our children is growing every day and so Jude Hospital takes responsibility for negotiating [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=320.47999999999996s)]
*  with these hospitals, foreign hospitals, and adding them to the list. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=327.76s)]
*  Our children are already in Germany, in Italy. From this week, they are flying to Spain, Canada, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=334.0s)]
*  France, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We would not be able to do this without the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=340.64s)]
*  partnership with St. Jude Global and Polish organization Hiroshi Foundation. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, thanks to St. Jude for that, but thanks to you and the people around you who are helping [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FfF87nySAs&t=351.2s)]
