# No Stealthy Escape For Cyber Ninjas, Says Judge
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg)
*  There are two words I really didn't want to keep saying in 2022, but here we are. Cyber [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=0.0s)]
*  ninjas. You may recall that last year, pro-Trump elected officials in Arizona hired a small [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=7.7s)]
*  cybersecurity firm called the Cyber Ninjas to conduct a so-called audit of Maricopa County's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=13.1s)]
*  2020 presidential election. Even though the audit turned out to be complete bullpucky, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=19.02s)]
*  it's worth noting that due to the nature of their work, the Cyber Ninjas were subject [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=25.14s)]
*  to public records requests. Back in June, the Arizona Republic sued for those records, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=28.7s)]
*  and the Cyber Ninjas were told to turn over the documents. But to this day, the Cyber [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=33.78s)]
*  Ninjas have not complied. Given that, the paper asked the judge overseeing the case [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=38.5s)]
*  to fine the Cyber Ninjas $1,000 a day. Well, yesterday, the judge says he doesn't think [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=43.62s)]
*  $1,000 a day would do any good. Maricopa Superior Court Judge John Hannah ruled that the company's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=49.54s)]
*  noncompliance was worth 50 times that amount. He wants the company to pay $50,000 a day, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=56.06s)]
*  saying he issued that ruling to, quote, put Cyber Ninjas on notice. And appears the company [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=64.54s)]
*  took notice. In a text message to NBC News, a company spokesperson said, quote, Cyber [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=70.66s)]
*  Ninjas is shutting down. All employees have been let go. But if that is an attempt to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=75.34s)]
*  avoid financial damages, like, say, the $50,000 a day for refusing to turn over documents, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=80.62s)]
*  the company might be out of luck. Yesterday, the judge explicitly warned that he would [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=86.42s)]
*  issue orders against the individuals responsible for providing those records should the company [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=91.7s)]
*  refuse to turn them over. Judge Hannah said, quote, the court is not going to accept the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=97.86000000000001s)]
*  assertion that Cyber Ninjas is an empty shell and that no one is responsible for seeing [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=103.84s)]
*  that it complies. Those fines will begin accruing today. The clock is officially ticking. The [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=109.24s)]
*  contractors, formerly known as Cyber Ninjas, can either be transparent and deliver whatever [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=116.24s)]
*  records are outstanding or they can pay up. I wonder which door they will choose. As Rachel [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=120.88s)]
*  would say, watch this space. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzJAfIxlYg&t=127.6s)]
