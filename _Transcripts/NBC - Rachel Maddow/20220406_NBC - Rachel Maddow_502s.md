# Patriotism Supplants Political Ideology In Ukrainian Fight To Repel Russian Invasion
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc)
*  Now, if you've been watching our coverage of the war in Ukraine these past six weeks, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=0.0s)]
*  you've probably heard me mention something called the Azov Battalion. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=4.04s)]
*  It's one of the more complicated and controversial parts of the story of Ukraine's defense against [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  the Russian invasion. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=12.72s)]
*  The Azov Battalion began as a far-right, ultra-nationalist militia that sprung up to fight Russia's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=14.32s)]
*  invasion of Crimea in 2014. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=20.14s)]
*  The group was known to have ties to neo-Nazi movements, and its leader was even quoted [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=23.12s)]
*  as saying Ukraine's purpose was to quote, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=27.8s)]
*  lead the white races of the world in a final crusade against semi-led [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=30.16s)]
*  Untermenschen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Untermenschen being the Nazi term for inferior races. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  Their members were known to display Nazi iconography on their uniforms, and today that same group [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  has about 10,000 forces fighting Russia across Ukraine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  It's been incorporated now into the Ukrainian military and is leading the fight against [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=52.96s)]
*  Russia in places like Mariupol on behalf of a pluralistic, liberal Ukrainian government [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=57.4s)]
*  led by a Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=64.4s)]
*  So like I said, this is complicated. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=68.12s)]
*  The Azov Battalion of today denies being motivated by any neo-Nazi or fascist ideology. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=70.64s)]
*  They say they've grown to include fighters of all different ideologies, though they admit [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=77.72s)]
*  they still count neo-Nazis among their ranks. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=82.48s)]
*  Now Russian President Vladimir Putin has tried to use the Azov Battalion's ties to the far [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=86.56s)]
*  right as justification for his campaign of so-called denazification in Ukraine, and we're [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  going to talk more about that a little later on in the show. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  It's no secret that war makes for strange bedfellows. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=101.0s)]
*  Ironically, the most famous example of this is probably the alliance between Western countries [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=104.04s)]
*  and the Soviet Union in World War II. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=109.48s)]
*  Between 1939 and 1941, almost two years, the Soviet Union and Germany, Nazi Germany, were [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=112.72s)]
*  allies. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=120.04s)]
*  That worked until Hitler decided to invade the Soviet Union in 1941. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=121.08s)]
*  But the question of how to think about the Azov Battalion looms large today. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=125.26s)]
*  The Washington Post, Sudarsan Raghavan, along with three other Post reporters, published [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=130.94s)]
*  a new detailed report today examining the Azov Battalion's role in the current fight [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=135.12s)]
*  against Russia. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=140.6s)]
*  He interviewed fighters from across the battalion as they shot at pictures of Vladimir Putin [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=141.98000000000002s)]
*  for target practice. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=146.0s)]
*  Some of the soldiers with whom he spoke had neo-Nazi tattoos and espoused far-right ideologies. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=147.62s)]
*  The leader of the Azov Battalion told the Washington Post that their force now includes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=153.96s)]
*  writers and other liberals, even members of the extreme left and anti-fascists. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=158.68s)]
*  Quote, we are at war for the very existence of Ukraine at the moment. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=164.6s)]
*  In the past month, I've never asked a person that came to join us about his political views. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=169.24s)]
*  Today, Ukrainians have only one option of political orientation, for or against Ukraine, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=174.36s)]
*  end quote. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=180.56s)]
*  He told the Washington Post that they are trying to weed out the neo-Nazi tattoos and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=181.56s)]
*  other symbols among Azov fighters, but in the current war, he cannot afford to lose [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=185.4s)]
*  any soldier because of political ideology, left or right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=189.72s)]
*  Quote, every soldier that fights for Ukraine is of value now, he said, and of value to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=194.04s)]
*  the Western world because if Ukraine will break, the next in trouble will be the collective [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  West, end quote. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=204.24s)]
*  Joining us now is Sudarsan Raghavan, a Washington Post correspondent who is the lead byline [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=206.12s)]
*  on that report. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=210.44s)]
*  He's just left Ukraine after a long time here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=211.44s)]
*  Sudarsan, good to see you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=213.88s)]
*  What did the soldiers you talked to think about the Azov battalion's bad history? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=216.72s)]
*  Good to be with you, Ali. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=224.28s)]
*  The soldiers we spoke to were pretty much dismissive of the Azov neo-Nazi links. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=228.0s)]
*  In fact, everyone we spoke to believed that this was all part of Russian propaganda, and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  many of them who joined the, those who joined the forces had friends already in the forces, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=241.28s)]
*  and they didn't see them, they didn't perceive their friends as Nazis or other form of, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=247.68s)]
*  espousing other forms of extremism. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=254.24s)]
*  What do you make of Vladimir Putin's use of the Azov battalion as justification for the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=260.12s)]
*  idea that Ukraine needs denazification? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=268.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=271.92s)]
*  You know, the thinking on the Azov is outdated from what we found. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=272.92s)]
*  I mean, it's based on what happened eight years ago and all those statements you mentioned [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=278.44s)]
*  earlier that came out publicly. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=284.8s)]
*  But since then, there's been a big effort, certainly by the Ukrainians, to alter the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=287.56s)]
*  Azov. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=293.76s)]
*  I mean, when they joined the Ukraine's National Guard, there were strong efforts to weed [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=294.88s)]
*  out extremists within the ranks. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  Also, we're looking at a much different situation here in this war. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's less about political ideology, more about patriotism and just moral outrage [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=308.96s)]
*  of what the Russians are doing in Ukraine, especially with all of the civilian casualties [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=314.44s)]
*  that we've been seeing and all the brutal potential war crimes that have been unfolding [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=320.88s)]
*  by Russia. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=326.28s)]
*  So yeah, so I mean, it's an outdated view. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=328.47999999999996s)]
*  And it's also, I mean, you have to understand that what Vladimir Putin is saying is something [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=331.52s)]
*  about a very small amount of Ukrainian society. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=337.47999999999996s)]
*  Even the analysts we spoke to, the fighters we spoke to, leaders say, yes, there are still [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=342.2s)]
*  extremists amongst our ranks, but it's a very small portion. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=345.96s)]
*  And one clear indication of how small the far-right elements are in Ukraine is that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=348.8s)]
*  the political arm of the Azov ran for elections a couple of years ago, and they only generated [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=354.76s)]
*  about 2 percent of the entire vote, even when they combined with other far-right parties. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=360.84s)]
*  So the battalion is extremely popular because they are fighting in Mariupol and not only [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=366.68s)]
*  defending Ukraine. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=372.52s)]
*  But in terms of the political arm, it doesn't generate that much popularity in Ukraine. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=374.28s)]
*  You know, the obviously men of a fighting age are not allowed to leave the country. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=382.84s)]
*  The president has invited people back. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  You and I both have run into people in Kiev or in Lviv who have come from other countries [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=389.28s)]
*  to fight. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=394.76s)]
*  They may be of Ukrainian heritage. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=395.76s)]
*  Some of them are Canadians and Americans who come here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=396.76s)]
*  Why would anybody join the Azov battalion as opposed to the open invitation to join [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=399.08s)]
*  the Ukrainian military or the National Guard? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=404.0s)]
*  It's a very good question. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=408.28s)]
*  I mean, a clear answer is that this is one of the most adept fighting units in Ukraine [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=410.0s)]
*  right now, and they're considered to many Ukrainian heroes, especially because of what [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=416.84s)]
*  their special forces units are doing in Mariupol. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=422.68s)]
*  They've been able to literally singlehandedly hold down, prevent the Russians from taking [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=425.0s)]
*  entire control of the whole city. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=429.96s)]
*  So there's a lot of goodwill from that. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=431.68s)]
*  I think the second thing is, look, it's impossible to avoid, to prevent any kind of extremists [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=434.08s)]
*  coming from Europe or the United States to join the Azov. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=440.84s)]
*  I mean, analysts we spoke to said that there are still coming, but it's a very small number. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=443.4s)]
*  So perhaps that is one reason. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=448.4s)]
*  I mean, the big danger, of course, is what we won't know now. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=449.8s)]
*  Perhaps we'll learn it in a few months or even years, is that whether or not some extremists [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=452.8s)]
*  did join the Azov and will return back to their home countries and possibly create, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=459.36s)]
*  you know, engage in violence or some sort of anti-government activity. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=463.84s)]
*  But we don't know that for sure. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=468.88s)]
*  For now, the big concern amongst everyone here is just liberals, left wing, right wing, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=469.92s)]
*  is getting together, picking up arms and fighting back the Russians. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VE2Ka2Arpc&t=477.15999999999997s)]
