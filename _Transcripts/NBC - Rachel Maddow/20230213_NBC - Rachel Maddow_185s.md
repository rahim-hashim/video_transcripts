# Why the Georgia prosecutor investigating Trump wants to keep the grand jury report sealed
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4)
*  We have a simple and very powerful concept in the U.S. judicial system. Prosecutors in the courts [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=0.0s)]
*  are not supposed to air accusations against anyone without giving the accused person the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  opportunity to refute the allegations and to defend themselves. It's a pillar of American [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=10.32s)]
*  justice that is due process, that is innocent until proven guilty, that is fair play. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=16.8s)]
*  And in Fulton County, Georgia, the district attorney there, Fannie Wallace, cited that need [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=23.04s)]
*  to be fair to any future defendants when she told a judge last month that she did not want [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=27.28s)]
*  release to the public a special grand jury's report on its investigation into 2020 election [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=33.68s)]
*  interference by Donald Trump and his associates. District Attorney Wallace was basically saying, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=40.72s)]
*  I know there is this grand jury report. I know that special grand jury said they want their [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=46.8s)]
*  report released to the public, but I say, no, don't do it. Don't give it to the public. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=51.6s)]
*  She's basically saying, wait for me to file indictments in court or not. Let the allegations [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=56.8s)]
*  be aired that way against people who will then be given a fair shot to defend themselves against [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=62.0s)]
*  those charges in court. Otherwise we should keep them secret. Well, today we know the judge hearing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  this case agreed with her argument in part. The judge in the case ruled against releasing the full [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  grand jury report at this juncture, except he decided he does want to release three sections of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=79.92s)]
*  it. The introduction, the conclusion, and this other part, which is interesting and sort of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=86.32s)]
*  unexpected. It's what he describes as the part of the grand jury's report in which the grand jury [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=94.16s)]
*  expresses its concerns about witnesses potentially lying to them under oath. The judge says that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=98.72s)]
*  section can be released because it doesn't name individual names of people who the grand jury is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=104.96s)]
*  accusing of lying. The judge says in his ruling, quote, because the grand jury does not identify [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=110.0s)]
*  those witnesses, that conclusion may be publicly disclosed at this time. But it's two bottom lines [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=116.0s)]
*  from this judge's ruling today. First, material from this report, at least the introduction, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=123.28s)]
*  the conclusion, and this part about people lying under oath, it's going to be coming out to the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=128.96s)]
*  public as of Thursday this week. And secondly, we know this also from the judge's ruling, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=132.8s)]
*  it does seem crystal clear from his wording today that the grand jury has recommended that people [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=139.44s)]
*  should be indicted under Georgia state law in this case. This again from Judge McBurney's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=145.04s)]
*  order today, quote, the final report provided the district attorney with exactly what she requested, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=151.12s)]
*  a roster of who should or should not be indicted and for what in relation to the conduct and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  aftermath of the 2020 general election in Georgia. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqV1_h7Fgz4&t=161.36s)]
