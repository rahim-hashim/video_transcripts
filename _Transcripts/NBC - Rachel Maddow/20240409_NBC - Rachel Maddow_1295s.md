# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 8
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To)
*  The story of this super high interest car loan company threatening its customers and getting in trouble all over the place for doing it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=0.0s)]
*  That story has crossed over now from the businesses and from the news of fraud and crime into national politics news. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=9.0s)]
*  Because this is the source of funds now that is supporting the man who has a very good shot of being the next president of the United States. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=20.0s)]
*  This is now the major source of funds for former president Donald Trump as he prepares to sit as a defendant in his first felony criminal trial, which starts one week from today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=28.0s)]
*  While he simultaneously is running for president as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=38.0s)]
*  The bank in question here, it really did used to be called Bank of Internet USA. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=43.0s)]
*  It has now changed its name to Axos Bank. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=49.0s)]
*  When Donald Trump left office in 2021, normal banks and businesses, at least for a while, purported to be shocked and horrified by him using mob violence to attack the U.S. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=53.0s)]
*  capital to try to stay in power by violence despite losing the election. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=65.0s)]
*  That was a particularly acute financial problem for him right when he left office, because in 2021, as he left office, he was facing looming deadlines to pay back huge amounts of money. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=70.0s)]
*  He was facing looming loans to pay back huge loans on both his Trump Tower property in New York and his golf club in South Florida. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=82.0s)]
*  Those loans were coming due when normal banks wanted absolutely nothing to do with him. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=90.0s)]
*  But not every bank, it turns out, is normal because this bank, Axos Bank, bailed him out of both of those huge loans. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=96.0s)]
*  They came out of nowhere, provided $225 million to Trump just before the deadline by which he needed to pay off those loans. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=104.0s)]
*  And that absolutely rescued him. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=111.0s)]
*  He also, at the time, wanted to get out of one of his big money-losing ventures, the Trump-branded D.C. Hotel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=115.0s)]
*  While Trump was president, that hotel was, of course, a convenient place to accept, effectively, small bribes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=121.0s)]
*  Any place, you know, a customer wanted to put money, any customer who wanted to put money in the sitting president's pocket could, in effect, do so by spending money at that hotel, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=127.0s)]
*  either on rooms or at the restaurants or what have you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=139.0s)]
*  And while I'm sure that was a great source of pleasure and flattery to the former president while he was president, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=142.0s)]
*  even with that weird secondary motivation for people to do business there, the hotel overall was a big economic loser. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=149.0s)]
*  While Trump was president, that hotel lost $70 million. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=156.0s)]
*  So he wanted to unload it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=162.0s)]
*  And then this weird thing happened because it's a money-losing property. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=164.0s)]
*  But nevertheless, after he left office, when he put it up for sale, he was able to get a surprisingly high price for it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=168.0s)]
*  Why was that? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=176.0s)]
*  Well, in part, it was because this same bank, Axos Bank, provided $190 million to grease the deal. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=177.0s)]
*  Now, is that a lot of money for them to put into it? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=187.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=189.0s)]
*  But Trump and his companies pocketed nearly half that amount when the deal was done. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=190.0s)]
*  So it seems like maybe that was plenty enough money to put into that deal to make it a sweet deal for him. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=194.0s)]
*  So this one entity, this financial entity linked to this usurious Carloans guy, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=201.0s)]
*  they've already dumped over $400 million on Trump since he left office. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=211.0s)]
*  Not counting the tens of millions of dollars they dumped on Jared while Jared was in the Trump White House. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=218.0s)]
*  And after. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=223.0s)]
*  And now it's these same folks who have come back and offered yet more. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=224.0s)]
*  In the fraud trial against Trump's real estate business, he was told by the court to put up a bond for $464 million [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=228.0s)]
*  to cover the huge judgment against him in that fraud trial. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=235.0s)]
*  Trump's lawyers, you will remember, told the court they'd approached 30 different firms about providing that bond. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=239.0s)]
*  All the firms, they said, said no. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=245.0s)]
*  They said everybody they went to said no. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=247.0s)]
*  Because of that, they said they had proven in practical terms, it's an impossibility to get a bond that big. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=250.0s)]
*  No one will do it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=257.0s)]
*  We've gone to 30 different firms. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=258.0s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=260.0s)]
*  We would have to put up real estate to be the collateral for a bond that big. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=261.0s)]
*  Nobody willing to consider a bond that big will accept real estate as a collateral. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=265.0s)]
*  Real estate as collateral. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=270.0s)]
*  It cannot be done. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=271.0s)]
*  Turns out maybe that wasn't true. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=273.0s)]
*  Turns out could have been done because this same guy, the Carloans guy, the pretend you're the pizza place, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=277.0s)]
*  super high interest, call your boss, call your mom, Carloan guy, the biggest shareholder in the bank that has one after another, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=286.0s)]
*  one after another been paying off all of Trump's debts for him since he left office. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=292.0s)]
*  This same guy says actually he'd be happy to put up the bond. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=297.0s)]
*  He says that he told Trump's lawyers he would put up that bond. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=302.0s)]
*  And yeah, explicitly, he'd take real estate as collateral. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=307.0s)]
*  That was no problem for him. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=311.0s)]
*  Trump's lawyers apparently never told the court that this guy had offered to post the bond. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=314.0s)]
*  In fact, they told the court that no one would post this bond. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=319.0s)]
*  The appeals court, apparently believing that no one would post the bond, then lowered the bond, lowered it down to $175 million, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=322.0s)]
*  which, ta-da, was then covered by this guy who had already offered to put up the much larger amount, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=331.0s)]
*  even though the court was told by Trump's lawyers that no one would do that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=341.0s)]
*  What did Trump have to do to be the recipient of such generosity from a man who, after all, is not that generous, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=346.0s)]
*  a man who, after all, would threaten illegally to lock you up for missing a car payment, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=355.0s)]
*  according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=361.0s)]
*  whose bank charged a Harlem soul food restaurant 268 percent interest on their business loan, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=364.0s)]
*  a guy who demanded daily payments from a small business in Massachusetts that he was charging over 90 percent interest to, right? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=372.0s)]
*  This does not seem like a guy who's involved in a lot of super generous business dealings. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=380.0s)]
*  What's he charging Trump for this $175 million favor? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=385.0s)]
*  And certainly there is a disturbance in the cosmos to have a man whose company was sued by the Justice Department [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=389.0s)]
*  for charging illegally high interest rates to active duty members of the U.S. military [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=397.0s)]
*  and illegally repossessing soldiers' cars so he could become a billionaire. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=402.0s)]
*  There is a disturbance in the cosmos that that same guy is now volunteering to a news organization. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=408.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a real low fee. I charged him for this most recent $175 million favor I posted for him [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=413.0s)]
*  after I already shoveled him, after me and these entities with which I am associated, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=420.0s)]
*  already shoveled him more than $400 million before this. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=424.0s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't charge him much. Why should I? Maybe I should have charged him a little more. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=428.0s)]
*  There is something that blots out the sun in that story, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=432.0s)]
*  except not in a way that makes you appreciate the wonders of the universe. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=436.0s)]
*  It makes you want to pound nails into something with your forehead, if you're like me. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=439.0s)]
*  Here's how the New York Times put it in a headline today. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=443.0s)]
*  Trump says abortion restrictions should be left to the states. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=448.0s)]
*  After months of mixed signals, Donald Trump said that whatever states decide must be the law of the land. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=453.0s)]
*  Similar headline over at the Washington Post. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=461.0s)]
*  In new video, Trump says abortion policies should be left to states. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=464.0s)]
*  Reuters had effectively the same takeaway. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=469.0s)]
*  It was the Reuters headline. Trump says abortion laws should be decided by US states. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=472.0s)]
*  Similar in The Guardian, Trump says each US state should determine different abortion laws. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=475.0s)]
*  Same thing over the Wall Street Journal. They gave theirs a little flourish. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=481.0s)]
*  Trump says states should chart their own paths on abortion. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=484.0s)]
*  Today, Donald Trump did put out a video statement in which he did indeed say that restrictions on abortions are things that should be decided by individual states. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=489.0s)]
*  Looking at these headlines, you might get the impression that that was somehow Trump moderating his position on abortion. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=500.0s)]
*  These headlines are exactly what Donald Trump wanted after delivering his remarks on abortion today. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=507.0s)]
*  Sadly, that is exactly what he got, even though the actual content of Donald Trump's remarks today indicated something very different than what was in those headlines. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=514.0s)]
*  The substantive new and important thing articulated by Donald Trump today was that he has now abandoned any criticism he once had for the strictest abortion bans that are now in effect or under consideration. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=525.0s)]
*  And I love me some New York Times and I love The Washington Post and I love Reuters and I love The Guardian and I love The Wall Street Journal. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=540.0s)]
*  I revere the free and fair press and I could not do 98 percent of what I do without reporting from institutions like these to give us the facts on which we base everything that we do in the news business. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=550.0s)]
*  But the headline spin today from multiple excellent news agencies about what Trump did was just absolutely at odds with the importance of what he said. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=565.0s)]
*  I mean, Florida has a total ban on abortion, a six-week ban on abortion that is set to go into effect on May 1st. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=577.0s)]
*  Trump, until now, was critical of strict abortion bans like Florida's. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=584.0s)]
*  He used to call abortion bans like that too severe. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=589.0s)]
*  He called the Florida abortion ban a quote terrible mistake. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=592.0s)]
*  Today, Trump eliminated that from his vocabulary. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=595.0s)]
*  He voiced no concern whatsoever with Florida's abortion ban or any other abortion restriction any state might want to impose. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=599.0s)]
*  Trump used to be a critic of six-week bans. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=607.0s)]
*  Now he's apparently fine with them. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=610.0s)]
*  Trump was also silent on the issue of a national abortion ban, which his own party has been relentlessly pushing. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=612.0s)]
*  A national ban is something he himself reportedly said he supports as recently as a few weeks ago. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=619.0s)]
*  Trump today also, for what it's worth, falsely accused Democrats of executing children. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=625.0s)]
*  That's what he said Democrats' abortion policies are. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=633.0s)]
*  It's to execute children, which is a nice QAnon flavor to it, in addition to being completely, completely false. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=636.0s)]
*  And so perhaps a more accurate headline about Donald Trump's remarks today might have been something like, you know, channeling QAnon conspiracy theory. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=646.0s)]
*  Donald Trump falsely accuses Democrats of executing children or Trump abandons previous criticism of strictest state abortion bans. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=654.0s)]
*  Trump avoids mention of Republican proposals for national restrictions. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=661.0s)]
*  I mean, or maybe try something like this. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=665.0s)]
*  Donald Trump also said today that he is, quote, proudly the person responsible for the ending of the constitutional right to an abortion, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=668.0s)]
*  proudly the person responsible for the overturning of Roe versus Wade. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=678.0s)]
*  He did explicitly say that today, and that would have made for a great headline. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=682.0s)]
*  Trump takes personal credit for ending the constitutional right to abortion in America, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=686.0s)]
*  abandons criticism of most draconian abortion bans. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=692.0s)]
*  Short, snappy, accurate, rightfully spotlighting the issue that Roe versus Wade is gone and it's because of him. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=697.0s)]
*  That's not how it got covered today, which I'm sure Trump is delighted with. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=705.0s)]
*  But the substance of the matter here gets darker from here because when the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade, thanks to Trump, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=710.0s)]
*  we didn't just lose the Roe versus Wade ruling and thereby the constitutional protection of the right to an abortion. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=717.0s)]
*  We also got something new, right? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=725.0s)]
*  The case that overturned Roe versus Wade was called Dobbs. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=727.0s)]
*  That decision created a brand new legal standard, one that would provide a precedent for taking away civil liberties of all kinds, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=730.0s)]
*  one that could be applied not just to abortion, but also to say the rights of gay people. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=738.0s)]
*  I mention that because we're seeing ripple effects from that decision not only now in our own country, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=746.0s)]
*  but far, far away from us, a continent away in the nation of Uganda. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=752.0s)]
*  Activists there have been fighting a radical, deadly new law that effectively hunts gay people. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=756.0s)]
*  This new law in Uganda punishes people just for being gay, punishes them with life in prison in some cases. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=763.0s)]
*  In some cases, it punishes being gay with the death penalty. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=770.0s)]
*  The second highest court in Uganda just upheld most of that law, including the death penalty part of it. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=774.0s)]
*  In their ruling, the court in Uganda cited Dobbs as the justification for why the kill the gays bill is legally sound. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=780.0s)]
*  We didn't just get the overturning of Roe versus Wade thanks to Donald Trump. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=789.0s)]
*  We got the new standard that replaces it, this Dobbs standard that is now being cited internationally as evidence that even in America, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=792.0s)]
*  nobody has a right to bodily autonomy, not to get an abortion and not to survive your own government if they decide to kill you for being gay. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=800.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Melissa Murray, law professor at New York University. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=810.0s)]
*  Melissa, thanks very much for being here. It's really nice to see you. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=813.0s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=816.0s)]
*  I, despite appearances, do not love doing media criticism. It's not my forte. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=818.0s)]
*  I'm also not a lawyer, but I did feel like the legal or the headline coverage today, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=825.0s)]
*  the media coverage today of Trump's statements sort of missed the nut of what it is that he actually said and the implications of his statement. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=831.0s)]
*  As a lawyer, as a close observer of these things, do you agree? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=838.0s)]
*  I think that's right. Donald Trump has sort of tacked back on issues of reproductive freedom. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=843.0s)]
*  He had said that he was in favor of a ban on abortion at perhaps 15 weeks, 20 weeks. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=848.0s)]
*  That would still be actually quite a significant development. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=855.0s)]
*  I mean, it really shows how much the Overton window has shifted since Dobbs. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=858.0s)]
*  A 15-week ban, a 20-week ban would have been patently unconstitutional under Roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=863.0s)]
*  So we've really moved far beyond that. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=869.0s)]
*  But again, this has been an issue with him and with his party. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=871.0s)]
*  They keep moving further and further to the right, and it seems he's willing to go there. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=875.0s)]
*  And as you say, it's not just questions of reproductive freedom in this country. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=879.0s)]
*  Dobbs has unsettled a whole body of jurisprudence that guarantees privacy, dignity and bodily autonomy for all individuals. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=883.0s)]
*  And it has ripple effects in other areas like marriage, like consensual sex. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=893.0s)]
*  And we are seeing that not here in the United States just yet, but in other places. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=897.0s)]
*  And it's very clear that we could also feel those reverberations in this country as well. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=901.0s)]
*  Well, what do you make of this court in Uganda citing Dobbs as essentially as a way to hold up America as a country that also believes [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=907.0s)]
*  there is no bodily autonomy that the state is right to encroach on your bodily autonomy in this case, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=917.0s)]
*  including to institute the death penalty for certain offenses associated with homosexuality? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=923.0s)]
*  What do you make of them citing us in that way for that purpose? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=929.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, Dobbs is an authoritarian opinion, and this is a decision that promotes the kind of authoritarianism [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=933.0s)]
*  we thought we had said goodbye to in this country when Bowers v. Hardwick was overruled in 2003, decriminalizing same-sex sex. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=941.0s)]
*  But it's not just that the Ugandan court said that Dobbs eliminated any right to bodily autonomy in the United States. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=949.0s)]
*  What they said specifically was that this was a question that was reserved for the people and was being returned to the people. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=957.0s)]
*  And the people were debating this. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=963.0s)]
*  And essentially, it's just a claim that majority will, can, and should prevail even over basic protections for minorities and protections for fundamental rights. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=965.0s)]
*  So it is essentially a call for mob rule, and we're seeing it in Uganda. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=975.0s)]
*  And we could certainly see it here. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=979.0s)]
*  I mean, people forget that Justice Thomas's concurrence in Dobbs was basically an invitation to begin litigating a range of different protections, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=981.0s)]
*  like protections for contraceptions, protections for intimate life, like same-sex sex and same-sex marriage. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=989.0s)]
*  All of those are on the table now that Roe has fallen, and Dobbs is the law of the land. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=995.0s)]
*  Early in my term, I announced a major plan to provide more than 40 million working middle-class American student debt relief. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1000.0s)]
*  Tens of millions. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1009.0s)]
*  Tens of millions of people's debt was literally about to get canceled. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1015.0s)]
*  But then some of my Republican friends and elected officials and special interests sued us, and the Supreme Court blocked us. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1020.0s)]
*  But that didn't stop us. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1026.0s)]
*  Today, I'm proud to announce five major actions to continue to relieve student debt for more than 30 million Americans. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1029.0s)]
*  President Biden speaking in Wisconsin today, announcing a new plan to lower student loan payments for tens of millions of Americans who have student loans. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1038.0s)]
*  The substance of this is straightforward, right? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1047.0s)]
*  Help people who are drowning under big student loan payments. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1050.0s)]
*  Our country wants people to go to college, so our country should reduce the disincentive to go to college by making it less economically disastrous to do so. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1053.0s)]
*  People who are having trouble with their student loans relieve that economic pain, make it easier on them. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1062.0s)]
*  The substance of it is straightforward. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1068.0s)]
*  The politics of it is straightforward, too, right? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1070.0s)]
*  Here's the president going to a critical swing state, unveiling a program that he hopes will be particularly popular with young people. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1072.0s)]
*  Young people, of course, particularly crucial for his bid for reelection. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1078.0s)]
*  So the substance is straightforward and important. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1083.0s)]
*  The politics are straightforward and important for President Biden. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1087.0s)]
*  But just as important are the politics on the other side. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1090.0s)]
*  Republicans already sued and successfully blocked one of President Biden's plans for forgiving student loans after President Biden pivoted to use a different program to forgive more student loans. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1094.0s)]
*  Republicans sued to stop that one, too. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1106.0s)]
*  Now, President Biden has announced this latest plan today in Wisconsin. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1108.0s)]
*  And so new Republican lawsuits against that one are expected any minute as well. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1112.0s)]
*  And just think about what that means. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1118.0s)]
*  Just like step back from that for a second. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1120.0s)]
*  Republicans are suing over and over again in multiple states. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1122.0s)]
*  Republicans are suing to make sure that Americans have to pay more in student loans to make sure that you have to pay more interest to banks on your student loans. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1126.0s)]
*  That is what they are offering America in this election year. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1139.0s)]
*  Isn't that what America most needs for banks to make more money off people who took out loans to go to college? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1143.0s)]
*  Isn't that really, you know, morally, isn't that a real justice issue for America? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1149.0s)]
*  Everything is so personality driven and the way we talk about politics, it sometimes just doesn't get covered. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1157.0s)]
*  But what the Republicans are offering in terms of policy right now, what they're actually doing in places where they have power, it's all stuff like this. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1163.0s)]
*  I mean, they really are trying desperately in a concerted effort across multiple Republican controlled states. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1171.0s)]
*  They are trying as hard as they can to make you pay more to the banks for your student loans in states where they are in power. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1176.0s)]
*  They are repealing child labor laws because, yeah, American voters are desperate for a solution to our long national nightmare of children not being allowed to work overnights in super dangerous jobs. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1185.0s)]
*  The most influential group of Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives just officially proposed raising the retirement age for Social Security [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1200.0s)]
*  because surely it's a huge problem in America that we're not forcing our elderly to work into more of their senior most years before they can collect their Social Security. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1209.0s)]
*  Raising the retirement age. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1220.0s)]
*  They're also still crusading against in vitro fertilization. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1222.0s)]
*  The Republican study group in the House still pushing against IVF and still pushing for a national abortion ban, even in the blue states, right? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1226.0s)]
*  On top of the draconian state bans that they've already put into place in almost every state in the country where Republicans are in control. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1235.0s)]
*  This is not a popular suite of policy proposals and policy options from the Republican Party. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1241.0s)]
*  The things that Republicans are setting themselves up against are supported by 70, 80, 90 percent of Americans in some cases. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1248.0s)]
*  So, yeah, if I were them, I'd prefer personality driven politics coverage as well. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1257.0s)]
*  So, here's how to do it. You tap on the App Store on your phone. You hit search on the bottom right corner. You type in MSNBC. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUhB5c2I7To&t=1278.0s)]
