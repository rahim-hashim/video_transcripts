# 'The IRS is freaking out': Trump pushes to give Musk acolyte access to Americans' personal tax data
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc)
*  Quote, Elon Musk's U.S. DOGE service is seeking access to a heavily guarded IRS system that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=0.0s)]
*  includes detailed financial information about every taxpayer, business and nonprofit in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=7.18s)]
*  the country, according to three people familiar with the activities, sparking alarm within [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=12.44s)]
*  the tax agency. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=17.92s)]
*  The Washington Post reporting that DOGE could get access to what's called the Integrated [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=19.64s)]
*  Data Retrieval System, which enables tax agency employees to access IRS accounts, including [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=24.12s)]
*  personal identification numbers and bank information. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  It also lets them enter and adjust transaction data, eek, and automatically generate notices, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=34.4s)]
*  collection documents and other records. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=41.72s)]
*  IDRS access is extremely limited. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=43.84s)]
*  Taxpayers who have had their information wrongfully disclosed or even inspected are entitled by [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=46.68s)]
*  law to monetary damages. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=51.96s)]
*  The request for DOGE access to the system has raised deep concern within the IRS. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=54.72s)]
*  According to the Washington Post, the White House is pressuring the IRS to give access [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=60.44s)]
*  to the system to one of Elon Musk's gang of young software engineers, a 25-year-old [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=63.96s)]
*  who has recently been trying to delete his online history of amplifying white supremacists [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=70.36s)]
*  praising the writing of a man who became a leading Holocaust denier. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=76.58s)]
*  This comes as the Washington Post newly reports tonight, and NBC News has also now confirmed [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=83.34s)]
*  that the acting head of the Social Security Administration has suddenly stepped down after [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=88.38s)]
*  what's described as a clash with Musk's team over access to very sensitive data in that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  system, in the Social Security system. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=100.22s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the reporters who broke this story, the Washington Post's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=103.58s)]
*  Jacob Bogage. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=106.46s)]
*  Mr. Bogage, thank you so much for being with us tonight. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=107.46s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=109.78s)]
*  Oh, thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=110.78s)]
*  Did I get any of that the wrong way around? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  Did everything I say there comport with your reporting and what you understand? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=115.7s)]
*  Totally checks out. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=119.62s)]
*  Great. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=121.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=122.5s)]
*  So as of tonight, do we know whether this young staffer from Elon Musk's team has access [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=123.5s)]
*  to that sensitive IRS system, has even given entree into that system yet? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=128.02s)]
*  We do know he has not gotten access to that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=133.17999999999998s)]
*  This memorandum of understanding between the White House and the IRS has not been codified [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=135.85999999999999s)]
*  yet. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  There's some details to work out. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  The IRS is freaking out, basically, about if and how and whether they should and if [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=145.61999999999998s)]
*  they can give that access and who would give it and how is it overseen and do they trust [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=153.06s)]
*  that that data can be secured. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=161.85999999999999s)]
*  The White House kind of sees this as a fate accompli and for good reason, which is because [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=164.06s)]
*  if the IRS says no, they could just start firing people. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=170.45999999999998s)]
*  And that's exactly what we saw over at Social Security. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=175.06s)]
*  It's a fate accompli to the White House that their representatives will get this information [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=177.78s)]
*  and if they don't get it, then people are going to quit or they're going to be fired. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=182.18s)]
*  That's what we're seeing across these agencies when the sensitive data is on the line. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=187.22s)]
*  Jacob, in that sequence that you just described, they can obviously, if they want to and they [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=192.3s)]
*  clearly do, they can fire their way through people who are resisting them one after the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=199.02s)]
*  other. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=202.98s)]
*  In some cases, we've heard in some agencies about what sound like almost physical altercations [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=204.46s)]
*  trying to keep Doge people out of skiffs, places where there's classified information [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=208.98s)]
*  and that sort of thing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=212.86s)]
*  But the other thing that's often operative here is the potential for a legal challenge, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=213.9s)]
*  some sort of injunction to stop these staffers, these Doge people from accessing systems like [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=218.5s)]
*  this one at the IRS or the one at the Social Security Administration that led to the head [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=224.34s)]
*  of that agency resigning over the weekend, as you also reported. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=228.66000000000003s)]
*  Do we know about whether legal threats are sort of part of the mix here with these sensitive [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=232.3s)]
*  systems? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  They are, but it's a little bit trickier. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=237.26000000000002s)]
*  When we've talked about legal threats at IRS, the main one we're watching right now is these [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=242.18s)]
*  mass firings that we expect at IRS. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=248.46s)]
*  They could be nine, 10,000 employees in one fell swoop. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=251.22s)]
*  Legal challenges there are really potent. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=258.14s)]
*  When it comes to systems control, eventually these people just serve at the pleasure of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=260.94s)]
*  the president of the United States. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=266.9s)]
*  It's pretty easy to fire them down the line. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQZCM-ADvc&t=269.02s)]
