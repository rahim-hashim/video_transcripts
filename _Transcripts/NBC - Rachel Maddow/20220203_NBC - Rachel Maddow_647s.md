# Neo-Nazis, Trump, Treat Racial Disparity Fix As Attack On White People In Health Care
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws)
*  Before 1980, there were two different Brigham hospitals in Boston that were both Harvard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=0.0s)]
*  med school teaching hospitals. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=6.04s)]
*  There was also the Boston Hospital for Women, which is kind of a weird concept, but that's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=8.36s)]
*  a thing that used to exist in medicine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=13.52s)]
*  In 1975, those three different Harvard medical school teaching hospitals, they all merged [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  and they got a new name. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=23.64s)]
*  They got the still awkward to this day name of Brigham and Women's. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=24.68s)]
*  That is the name of the hospital. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=29.88s)]
*  It's a major teaching hospital. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=31.4s)]
*  As I said, it is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=33.04s)]
*  It's really prestigious. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=35.76s)]
*  It's really accomplished. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=36.76s)]
*  It's actually one of the most highly rated hospitals not only in the United States. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=37.8s)]
*  It's one of the most highly rated hospitals in the whole world. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=41.4s)]
*  And a week and a half ago at Brigham Women's Hospital in Boston, this happened. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=46.36s)]
*  They had an outbreak of Nazis. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=53.56s)]
*  This is a neo-Nazi group based in Worcester, Massachusetts. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=56.72s)]
*  We know that because they put their email address on the threatening flyer that the [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=60.38s)]
*  group handed out at the hospital. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=63.92s)]
*  Hi ProtonMail, your servers are being used as contact information for literal Nazi recruitment [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=65.96s)]
*  efforts in the United States. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=71.44s)]
*  Did you know? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=72.8s)]
*  The Nazi group was out in front of Brigham and Women's Hospital. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=75.24s)]
*  A week ago Saturday, they handed out flyers targeting two doctors by name, accusing them [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=78.24s)]
*  of anti-white genocidal policy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=84.08s)]
*  And these guys lined up in their little khaki pants and their little matching shirts and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=87.8s)]
*  their masks. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=93.12s)]
*  And they held up this big sign. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=94.8s)]
*  Brigham and Women's Hospital kills whites. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=96.4s)]
*  Really. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=100.12s)]
*  The hospital kills whites, kills white people. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=102.36s)]
*  And so the Nazis are out there in front of the hospital on Saturday morning defending [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=105.58s)]
*  all the poor white people from the doctors in the hospitals that are trying to kill all [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=109.68s)]
*  the white people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=113.76s)]
*  Why do the Nazis think that the hospitals are trying to kill the white people? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  Where do they get this from? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=119.36s)]
*  Well, this happened exactly one week prior. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=121.48s)]
*  The left is now rationing life-saving therapeutics based on race, discriminating against and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=126.84s)]
*  denigrating just denigrating white people to determine who lives and who dies. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=134.96s)]
*  If you're white, you don't get the vaccine or if you're white, you don't get therapeutics. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=141.68s)]
*  If you're white, you have to go to the back of the line to get medical help. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=147.0s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=151.52s)]
*  If you're white, you go right to the back of the line. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=152.52s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  If you're white, you go right to the back of the line. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  That was Trump speaking Saturday the 15th. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  It was Saturday the 22nd. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=162.44s)]
*  Exactly one week later, there's the Nazis outside the hospital in Boston with their big sign. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=164.02s)]
*  This hospital kills white people. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=169.68s)]
*  They're so pleased with themselves, they posted like a travelogue of themselves all taking [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=172.84s)]
*  the tea in Boston, wearing their little Nazi outfits and handing out their Nazi flyers [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=177.02s)]
*  to people on the platform waiting for their train. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=181.12s)]
*  The whole group of them throwing their little Heil Hitler's Nazi salutes on public transportation, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  doing the white power hand gesture thing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=189.52s)]
*  Oh wait, more Nazi salutes. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Never get tired of that one. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=194.16s)]
*  This is Massachusetts last weekend. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=196.92s)]
*  We're having a problem with this as a country right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  How are we dealing with it? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=203.28s)]
*  Part of the way we are dealing with it is by good investigative reporting. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=206.04s)]
*  Joining us now is Philip Martin. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  He is a senior investigative reporter for GBH News, which is an NPR station in Boston. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=211.04s)]
*  Mr. Martin, it's a pleasure to have you with us tonight. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=215.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  Rachel, thank you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  Much appreciated. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  Let me just ask if there's anything else that you've been able to report out about this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=220.88s)]
*  disturbing demonstration, this group that showed up at the hospital in Boston. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  Is there anything that you can tell us about the size of this group, the other kind of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  stuff that they've been doing? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=235.08s)]
*  We can talk about the size to some degree. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=237.4s)]
*  Your summary, by the way, was excellent. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=239.96s)]
*  The size, this has always been a minute and fringe organization, but right now they're [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=241.88s)]
*  part of what you see as a trend, the mainstreaming of extremism. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=248.36s)]
*  This is a French group that has suddenly attracted new members. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  We know that because the Anti-Defamation League of New England has been counting them and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=257.2s)]
*  said that the demonstration outside of the Brigham and Women's Hospital that you pointed [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=262.2s)]
*  out was larger than most of their demonstrations. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=267.76s)]
*  On most occasions, they might attract four or five people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=271.04s)]
*  This time they've attracted about two dozen people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=274.64s)]
*  So, the size is still small when we talk about organizations. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  But as far as an extreme right neo-Nazi organization, it's considered significant. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  One of the things that I thought was really interesting about your reporting, Philip, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  was to contextualize this over time. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=293.24s)]
*  This is not the first time these doctors have been targeted, including by name. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=297.44s)]
*  And in this case, it was very disturbing to have their photos distributed, right, at their [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=302.12s)]
*  place of work. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=305.52000000000004s)]
*  And at the same time, the hospital has been targeted. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=306.52s)]
*  I was really interested to have you put that in context in terms of the kinds of scholarly [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=308.2s)]
*  work they've done. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=313.0s)]
*  Some of the pioneering research those doctors took part in was about heart failure. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  Patients in the hospital with heart failure have better outcomes when they're put on the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=321.88s)]
*  cardiology unit rather than being treated in general medicine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  These doctors were among a research team that found that, all things being equal, Black [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=328.76s)]
*  and Latino patients with heart failure were less likely to be put in the cardiology unit. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=332.76s)]
*  And that's where you get better outcomes. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  It was a really specific kind of racial health disparity that they identified, that they [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=339.0s)]
*  proved, and that they've since been trying to fix. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=343.8s)]
*  I just want to make sure that I understand that right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=347.8s)]
*  That's the first time I had known about the link between those doctors and that research [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  in your reporting. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=353.64s)]
*  And is that part of the way they're being targeted for that kind of work? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=355.24s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=358.96s)]
*  What you and many others, most people would call sort of striving for equity and equality [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=361.68s)]
*  in medicine, trying to get past the legacy of what Harriet Washington called medical [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  apartheid, trying to create justice within the medical field, they identified a specific [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  problem that is, as you pointed out, that Black, Latino, Latinx patients were not receiving [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=384.0s)]
*  the same quality of care. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=390.96s)]
*  And therefore, they wanted to level the playing field within the hospital system. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=393.12s)]
*  That has been described by neo-Nazis who are essentially echoing others, such as Donald [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=400.96s)]
*  Trump, I'm afraid. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=407.52s)]
*  That has been described as preferential treatment and anti-white. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=408.52s)]
*  They are indeed echoing a sentiment that is widespread on social media, where the minute [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=414.88s)]
*  you mention equity in the context of medicine and many other things for that matter, it's [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=423.24s)]
*  construed as anti-white. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=427.76s)]
*  It's a very insidious type of propaganda that we're hearing right now that years ago would [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=430.06s)]
*  be considered fringe. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=437.08s)]
*  And it has now seeped, not seeped, it's flooded into the mainstream. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=439.04s)]
*  And that's what we're dealing with right now, Rachel. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=444.58s)]
*  Mr. Martin, I'm sort of trying to put this in context a little bit in terms of the medical [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=446.78s)]
*  community in Boston, because Boston has a big, powerful health care community. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=452.78s)]
*  It is some of the best hospitals in the world. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=458.94s)]
*  They do attract medical talent from all over the world. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=460.79999999999995s)]
*  Now that this harassment and targeted harassment of individual doctors and to a certain degree, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=464.26s)]
*  hospitals has reached this level of scary and frankly, to my eyes, disgusting levels. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=470.86s)]
*  Is there any sign that these doctors who have been personally targeted and terrorized like [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=479.42s)]
*  this and the hospital too, are they getting support? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=484.54s)]
*  Are they getting backup from the broader and as I say, powerful, influential medical community [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=487.38s)]
*  in Boston and around New England? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=493.62s)]
*  To a large degree, yes. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=497.62s)]
*  The American Medical Association, for example, the AMA, traditionally a very conservative [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=499.46s)]

*  Their led, their equity efforts are led by a doctor who has done quite a bit, Aletha [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=511.14s)]
*  Maybank, who has been working tirelessly to basically create equity as the chief equity [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=519.9399999999999s)]

*  They recognize that there are internal problems within the organization and they're basically [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=555.1s)]
*  zeroing in on that. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=561.5400000000001s)]
*  It's the reason also why this report today, the GBH report that you referenced, we focused, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=563.26s)]

*  Very important. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=578.58s)]
*  That research is in fact receiving support around the country of doctors like Manisha [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6yEA5whgws&t=579.9s)]
