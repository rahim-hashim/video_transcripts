# Media largely ignores Trump press event, but not his newly released tax returns
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU)
*  So here's some news that is about the news, which is usually my least favorite thing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=0.0s)]
*  But tonight, this is oddly cheering. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=7.0s)]
*  This feels like we're growing up maybe. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=9.88s)]
*  Something's changing, maybe in a good way. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=12.08s)]
*  So New Year's Eve was Saturday night, and on Saturday night, former President Donald [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=15.22s)]
*  Trump announced that he would be holding a press conference. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=19.52s)]
*  He would be holding a media availability at his resort house golf thingy in South Florida. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=21.76s)]
*  And because he is a former president, one who was very much in the news, and he's a [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=29.78s)]
*  candidate for president in 2024, and he's declared that he's doing a live press conference, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=34.5s)]
*  right, there's a certain responsibility in news circles to make sure that there is coverage [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=38.660000000000004s)]
*  available for that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=42.86s)]
*  And it was NBC, actually, who was assigned to be what's called the pool camera for that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=44.86s)]
*  event. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=48.66s)]
*  News agencies take turns doing that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=49.66s)]
*  They send a pool camera so a whole bunch of news networks can effectively share that footage. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=51.22s)]
*  So we know there was a pool camera. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=57.22s)]
*  Because of that, we know that lots of outlets had the technical ability to cover Trump's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=59.46s)]
*  New Year's Eve press conference. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=64.5s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  Nobody did. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=70.02s)]
*  Not even Fox. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=71.62s)]
*  Not even that one that's called Newsmax. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=72.88s)]
*  The only outlets that did run with Trump's press conference were like these guys. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=77.18s)]
*  Hope and optimism filled the air as President Donald J. Trump concluded the year of 2022 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=84.58s)]
*  in style at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=88.86s)]
*  There you go. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=89.86s)]
*  Obviously, first lady looking stunning. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=90.86s)]
*  Stunning in style. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=93.86s)]
*  Hope and optimism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=98.86s)]
*  Now, we would normally expect outlets like the Fox News Channel to be doing similar coverage [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=99.86s)]
*  to these guys. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=104.82s)]
*  But instead, this is what Fox News was airing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=106.94s)]
*  I kid you not. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=109.62s)]
*  The segment right before Trump gave his media availability that they did not air. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=110.98s)]
*  He inflated the value of his properties when he was borrowing from the banks, but then [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=116.54s)]
*  turned around when he was doing his taxes and was like, actually, the property value [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=122.82000000000001s)]
*  went way down. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=126.38000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, I don't know what's going on with the shirt or whatever, but they were talking [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=129.38s)]
*  Trump taxes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=132.76s)]
*  They were actually airing a weird snarky segment going through all of the Trump 2022 tax scandals, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=133.76s)]
*  including what's in his recently released tax returns. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=140.66s)]
*  And they were not covering his live press conference, which was just about to start. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=144.9s)]
*  To misquote a different former president, rarely is the question asked, is our media [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=150.74s)]
*  learning? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  But maybe we are. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  What if Trump gave a substance-free press conference and nobody came? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  Nobody covered it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=163.1s)]
*  Last Friday, the House Ways and Means Committee did release all of Trump's tax returns to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  2015 to 2020. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  And critics of that decision keep saying, well, they did it to Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=170.1s)]
*  Now they'll do it to everybody. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=173.01999999999998s)]
*  Everybody since everybody else running for president since Richard Nixon has done it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=175.82s)]
*  So saying, oh, now they'll do it to everybody. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=182.29999999999998s)]
*  All the other presidential candidates already do it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=185.34s)]
*  This isn't a gigantic pool of people we're talking about here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=187.5s)]
*  It's just Trump who tried to run for president and be president without releasing his tax [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  returns. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=195.85999999999999s)]
*  If the Congress takes it upon itself to release any other candidate or any other president's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=196.86s)]
*  tax returns because they chose not to do it themselves, I'm not sure why anyone would [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=201.18s)]
*  complain. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=205.74s)]
*  Still, though, you can see why Trump might have fought so hard to keep these things secret [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=206.74s)]
*  all these years. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=211.82000000000002s)]
*  There is the mere fact that while Trump was paying next to nothing in taxes in the United [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=213.06s)]
*  States, he was paying lots of taxes in foreign countries, which is an interesting take on [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=216.74s)]
*  America first. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=222.34s)]
*  The returns are full of red flags like sketchy and arguably illegal inflation and deflation [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  of the value of his assets, repeated large supposed loans to his adult children that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=229.7s)]
*  don't make any sense unless he was trying to avoid gift tax. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  There's the classification of huge amounts of what appear to be personal expenses as [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=239.42s)]
*  if they are tax deductible business expenses. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=243.22s)]
*  There's the bottom line fact that Trump's wealth is almost entirely inherited from his [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=246.82s)]
*  and he himself as a businessman has done next to nothing other than lose the money that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=251.78s)]
*  he inherited. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=256.02s)]
*  I mean, you can see all of that as reasons why he didn't want these things to be public. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=257.02s)]
*  But the top line unresolved issue with Trump's taxes is how he got away without scrutiny [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=262.66s)]
*  from the IRS. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=268.46s)]
*  Every president since Nixon was revealed to be cheating on his taxes has been required [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=270.3s)]
*  to undergo a presidential audit by the IRS. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=277.1s)]
*  It is a mandatory thing that the IRS has to audit presidents every year. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=279.94s)]
*  President Obama was president for eight years. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=284.82s)]
*  He underwent an IRS audit eight times. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=287.74s)]
*  Biden has been president for two years. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=290.14s)]
*  He has already done two IRS audits, but somehow they never got around to doing it to Trump. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=291.94s)]
*  Somehow Trump's taxes just didn't get scrutinized. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=296.9s)]
*  Now, this is an ongoing story as it pertains to Trump, as the thousands of pages of his [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  returns get combed through by the experts who know how to read these things. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=306.86s)]
*  But the IRS blowing him off, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=311.5s)]
*  The IRS blowing off the mandatory audit they were supposed to do about Trump. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=313.94s)]
*  That is an inexplicable story that appears to be about them, the IRS, not about Trump [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=319.18s)]
*  himself, which means that's a live news story right now for which the IRS undoubtedly has [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=323.22s)]
*  to answer. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iaa0_il8eyU&t=330.06s)]
