# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 28
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo)
*  We heard a lot from our viewers about a man we talked to on Friday's show, a resident [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=0.0s)]
*  of Keefe, a restaurant owner named Alexander Prokorenko. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=6.08s)]
*  He told us he was still in the capital city, but he was actually planning to leave after [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=9.36s)]
*  the show, after we spoke with him. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=12.72s)]
*  He has still not been able to leave. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=14.84s)]
*  He and his family can't get gas for a car. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=16.32s)]
*  Also, the trains are just packed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  For those who have had to stay, like Alexander and his neighbors, they've been forced to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=21.76s)]
*  adapt over these last few days to make sure they're ready for what they think may be coming. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=26.16s)]
*  This is some new video he just sent us of the very cold underground parking garage where [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=30.76s)]
*  he and his neighbors have been spending their nights. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=35.16s)]
*  He tells us they did pick up some weapons this weekend, the ones the Ukrainian government [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=37.88s)]
*  has been handing out. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=41.64s)]
*  Neither he nor any of his neighbors have any military training, but Alexander said they're [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  teaching themselves. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  They're now taking turns guarding their building. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=48.56s)]
*  His turn started today at 3 a.m. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  They're also making rounds to try to find food. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=53.96s)]
*  Alexander says he decided to get a special permit to allow him to move around Kiev. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=57.6s)]
*  When he got that permit, the government put these yellow markers on his car to alert authorities [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=61.84s)]
*  that he's cleared to travel, that he's not a threat. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=66.56s)]
*  Still though, people manning checkpoints aren't taking any chances. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=69.92s)]
*  He's been stopped and checked repeatedly. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=72.64s)]
*  In this case, he thanked the armed forces that stopped him, took a photo with them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=75.2s)]
*  He called them my guys. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Alexander is using his ability to drive in the streets of Kiev to help. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=81.68s)]
*  He's driving neighbors to the train station, buying groceries for people. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  Here he is driving neighbors to the train, going to a nearby cafe to pick up food, to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=88.08s)]
*  donate. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=93.92s)]
*  You can tell that not a lot of people have gotten permits to move around or people who've, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=95.56s)]
*  you know, not a lot of people have stayed if they could leave. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=99.68s)]
*  The streets, as he shows us here, are empty. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=102.12s)]
*  Of course, the thing that disrupts the silence are sirens and bombs and airstrikes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=104.6s)]
*  They're attacking Kiev everywhere. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=111.64s)]
*  We just hear them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=113.92s)]
*  Big explosion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=114.8s)]
*  Like a huge one. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=116.4s)]
*  Yes, we have to run because of the airstrikes. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=117.84s)]
*  They just went up to the apartment to get some, you know, rest because there wasn't [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=121.12s)]
*  any, any bombing that you have to go now. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=128.36s)]
*  Alexander and his neighbors are still in that freezing underground parking garage, protecting [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=134.0s)]
*  themselves, trying to protect their building, trying to stay safe. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=138.32s)]
*  They are keeping the couple of guns they have and the few bullets they have nearby. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=140.84s)]
*  That doesn't mean they want this fight. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  Joining us again is Kiev resident and restaurant owner Alexander Prokorenko. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=148.4s)]
*  Mr. Prokorenko, I'm happy to see you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry you're still there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  Thanks for being with us. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=155.68s)]
*  Hi Rachel. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=156.68s)]
*  Hi. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=157.68s)]
*  How have the last 72 hours been? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=158.68s)]
*  Well, it's been, it's been hard because every time, you know, it's, it's the bombs are closer. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=162.0s)]
*  The shots are closer. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=168.64s)]
*  We heard the gunfire every night and, you know, the mass media is always telling us [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=171.27999999999997s)]
*  that it will be an airstrike again and again and again. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  But still, you know, we got used to it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  And the thing is, we all, you know, became more, more united. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=183.32s)]
*  We became together and we support each other. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=190.66s)]
*  And this is so good. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=193.48s)]
*  You know, our nation is, has never been stronger than before than now. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=195.32s)]
*  And as you told previously, yes, I went yesterday and there was a huge queues to buy some food. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  But and we couldn't. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  But we went to our restaurants. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=212.32s)]
*  We took some food that we had there. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=214.72s)]
*  And my friends also from the restaurant business, we all walked together and we have some food. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=217.6s)]
*  We prepare some food for the kindergartens, for the hospitals, for for the army. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=224.08s)]
*  So basically, you know, and this time I would say I don't want to leave. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=229.84s)]
*  This is this is our land and we want to stay. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  We don't want to run away because this is where we belong to. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=239.72000000000003s)]
*  This is our homeland. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  This is Ukraine. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=246.66000000000003s)]
*  This is Kiev. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  Are you worried about access to basic supplies, to to water, to food, to even for ammunition? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=249.4s)]
*  It seems like supply lines aren't supply lines aren't there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  And so what you've got, you've got. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=260.08s)]
*  Yes, we are worried. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=262.64s)]
*  But I think I hope and I believe that our president and our major will cope with that, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=264.2s)]
*  you know, because that will be a big problem, because yesterday, even to the drug stores [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=270.52s)]
*  and and the supermarkets, I couldn't my neighbors got in because we divided what we each have to do. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=276.2s)]
*  But but we managed to get some to get some food for for the next week. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  And we'll see what will happen in a week. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=292.44s)]
*  But there is a lot of garbage on the streets because there is no cleaners. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=294.8s)]
*  And this is and this city looks like a mess. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=300.04s)]
*  But people, you know, we we strongly believe because of our president's Lenski, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=306.12s)]
*  he gives us so much hope because he talks to us and he every time he saying what he did and how he did. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, we're never been stronger than than before. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=324.0s)]
*  And I would say, you know, let's need to join us, not us join NATO. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=328.12s)]
*  So I think that sentiment is something that a lot of people can identify with right now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=335.48s)]
*  Alexander, I know it's five in the morning right now, and this is a stressful time. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=341.44s)]
*  But I'm going to warn you right now that we're going to keep asking you to come back to keep us updated on on you and your family and your friends. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=344.96s)]
*  Godspeed. Good luck. Thank you. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=350.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  Madam Secretary, one of the things that's happened in recent days is that people who have spent time with Putin, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=356.16s)]
*  who have sat across the table from him at negotiations and talks over the years, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=361.20000000000005s)]
*  say that as much as they might have either disliked or thought that Putin was ruthless before, he seems different. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=364.92s)]
*  He doesn't seem like himself. He seems like there might be something wrong with him, that he might be nuts. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=373.36s)]
*  We've heard that from people who have been in diplomatic negotiations with him before. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=380.16s)]
*  I wanted to get your take on that, both as somebody who has spent time with him, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=384.56s)]
*  but also your take on whether or not that should factor into how we strategize against him now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=388.68s)]
*  Well, it's a difficult question to answer from afar, obviously. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=395.72s)]
*  I think the reports coming out suggest both his temperament, his paranoia seems to have increased dramatically. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  His vindictiveness, his dictatorial approach to the people around him, including his own military leadership, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=413.12s)]
*  seems to have gone further and deeper than anybody had ever seen before. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=421.47999999999996s)]
*  People have also suggested that maybe physically he's facing some health challenges. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=426.28s)]
*  I think it's important for leaders, intelligence agencies, to get the best information they can. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  But ultimately, the people closest to Putin, those who have to deal with him, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=438.68s)]
*  those who he's keeping at the end of 40-foot tables while he issues bizarre orders, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=443.28s)]
*  they're the ones who need to act. They need to act for the good of Russia. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=450.08s)]
*  They need to stop him. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  Whether or not this has turned into some kind of physical or mental problems that he either had [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=458.44s)]
*  or has in some way come down with, we don't know. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=467.32s)]
*  But his behavior is dangerous, and it's dangerous to the future of Russia. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=471.68s)]
*  So my hope is that the people who are watching him, those who get close enough to see in person his behavior, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=477.76s)]
*  which is so erratic, that they can try to prevent him from doing things that will not only be tragic [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=486.96s)]
*  for Ukraine, but tragic for Russia, too. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=496.48s)]
*  This should be stopped for Russia's sake. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=499.92s)]
*  Joining us now live is former Secretary of State, First Lady, Senator, presidential nominee, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=504.16s)]
*  Hillary Rodham Clinton. Madam Secretary, thank you so much for making time to be here. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  I really appreciate you accepting our invitation. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=512.88s)]
*  Happy to talk with you tonight. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=516.24s)]
*  First, let me just ask you if you think we're asking the right questions here. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=520.08s)]
*  When you look at this war, when you look at these past five days, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=523.88s)]
*  what do you think is the most important thing for the American people to understand? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=527.28s)]
*  I think all of your questions are really important, but I would put a big umbrella over them, Rachel, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  for the American people, really for citizens of all democracies, that this may at first be somewhat confusing [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=539.9599999999999s)]
*  for those who are looking at it from the outside, but make no mistake, this is not just an unprovoked, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=550.32s)]
*  aggressive invasion by Russia. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=558.44s)]
*  It is an effort by Putin and those who prop him up and enable him to really wage war on the rule of law [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=562.5200000000001s)]
*  and democracy, on freedom. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=572.56s)]
*  And it's critically important that, as we've seen in the last days, that democratic governments and people [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=575.04s)]
*  rally to support Ukraine in this struggle, because it's also our struggle. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=584.16s)]
*  In terms of the Western response, I will not be the first observer to note that the speed and unanimity [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=592.2399999999999s)]
*  of the Western world's response has been a surprise. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  The idea that the Russian sanctions at this point would be multilateral, that even banking sanctions [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=603.64s)]
*  would involve countries like Singapore and Switzerland, of all places, that the Russian Central Bank [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=611.12s)]
*  would be sanctioned, that countries like Germany, which for very good historical reasons don't send weapons [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  abroad, would be sending weapons directly into Ukraine to help them, the European Union would be sending [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=623.5999999999999s)]
*  in weapons. I think it is a remarkable show of single purpose by the Western world to help. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=628.92s)]
*  It also feels like, while it simultaneously feels like more than we can imagine, it also feels like not enough. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=637.52s)]
*  How do you view the Western response thus far? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=643.56s)]
*  Well, I agree with you that it is remarkable. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=647.52s)]
*  I give President Biden and the Biden administration a lot of credit for leading the world to this point. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=649.9599999999999s)]
*  The strategy of disclosing intelligence to demonstrate very clearly that Putin was trying to do once again [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=659.0s)]
*  what he had done before, use disinformation, false flag operations in order to try to justify an [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  unjustifiable invasion, was incredibly smart, unprecedented, and it seems to have really woken up [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=677.28s)]
*  so much of the world and stymied Putin. And bringing not just Europe, but as you say, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=684.72s)]
*  countries as far-flung as Singapore, even Japan and others, to understand that this threat was [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=692.32s)]
*  global. It certainly is a direct threat to Western democracies right in the heart of Europe. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=698.5600000000001s)]
*  But to let an autocrat do what Putin decided to do is something that everybody has a stake in trying to stop. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=705.6s)]
*  So up until now, the kind of economic pressures that have been brought to bear, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=714.6s)]
*  I think are not only remarkable, but seem to be really biting. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=721.08s)]
*  And the second point you make, providing necessary weapons to Ukraine has begun. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=725.16s)]
*  It needs to be accelerated. The Ukrainians need Stinger missiles to shoot down Russian aircraft. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=732.9599999999999s)]
*  They need Javelin missiles to stop tanks. They need a lot of ammunition. They need as much support [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=738.7199999999999s)]
*  as they possibly can be given because it is a two-pronged approach now. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=746.4s)]
*  The president, Zelensky, who has been extraordinary and deserves the thanks and gratitude, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=753.5999999999999s)]
*  appreciation, admiration of all of us, is trying to operate on two levels. He's trying to continue [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=760.4s)]
*  to rally his people to fight the Russian invaders. But he's also saying, look, I'll talk to you. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=768.64s)]
*  I don't know what can come of it because that is a possible way out. If the Ukrainians, with our help, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=776.9599999999999s)]
*  can impose enough economic pain on Putin and, sadly, the Russian people, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=785.2s)]
*  combined with providing weapons, that that might be the only way that right now I can see us [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=792.88s)]
*  getting to a stalemate that might save the Ukrainian people from even greater tragedy. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=799.04s)]
*  Everybody should ratchet the pressure. I was disappointed to see that some of the so-called [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=814.48s)]
*  crypto exchanges, not all of them, but some of them, are refusing to end transactions with Russia, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  from some philosophy of libertarianism or whatever. Everybody, and if there has to be legal [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=839.6s)]
*  or regulatory pressure, everybody should do as much as possible to isolate Russian economic [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=846.6400000000001s)]
*  activity right now. That pressure will absolutely impact Putin. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=853.6800000000001s)]
*  The last time you were here, Madam Secretary, you raised that point. I hadn't asked you about [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=859.36s)]
*  it at all, and you said you wanted to put a sort of spotlight on the need for regulation of the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=864.08s)]
*  crypto market specifically for national security purposes so that they couldn't serve as an escape [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=868.24s)]
*  hatch in the case of multilateral action to try to lock people out from specific currency for [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=873.52s)]
*  national security reasons. In this case, crypto is looking like it could potentially be an escape [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=882.48s)]
*  hatch as even the Russian central bank is sanctioned and as we've seen these otherwise [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=887.84s)]
*  multilateral actions. I have to ask, since you've been raising those concerns, have you seen the [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=892.32s)]
*  Biden administration or even indeed other governments around the world start to take [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=897.6s)]
*  that seriously in terms of how the crypto markets could be undermining in national security [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=902.88s)]
*  environments like this one? Well, I think they're starting to take seriously the need to figure out [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=908.4s)]
*  the market and to provide guardrails, as you definitely should with any kind of large [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=914.48s)]
*  financial market like this has become. I think in the specific case of Ukraine, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=921.6s)]
*  I do think that the Treasury Department, I think the Europeans should look hard at how they can [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=928.0s)]
*  prevent the crypto markets from giving an escape hatch to Russia, both governmental and private [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=933.76s)]
*  transactions in and out of Russia. And I would hope they would do that because it's so ironic, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=940.88s)]
*  Rachel, because for people who live to make money, if they're making it [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=947.76s)]
*  legally, if they're not just a device or an excuse for money laundering, they should not want this [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=954.7199999999999s)]
*  invasion by Russia to stand. They should figure out that we don't need to be descending into [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=964.0s)]
*  some kind of global conflict where dictators can decide that they're going to try to take over [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=972.88s)]
*  countries just because they wake up one morning, no provocation at all. So it's really in the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=980.88s)]
*  interests of everyone who wants to do legitimate business to try to end this conflict as quickly [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=987.28s)]
*  as possible. And one of the two pillars that we can rely on right now is the economic pillar. So [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=992.56s)]
*  I would hope somebody at the Treasury Department is trying to figure out how they're going to [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=999.04s)]
*  rein in the leaky valves in the crypto market that might allow Russia to escape the full [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=1004.0s)]
*  weight of the sanctions. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPRmbV2vLzo&t=1012.48s)]
