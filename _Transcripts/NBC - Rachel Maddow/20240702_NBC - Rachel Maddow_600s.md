# Exclusive: Stormy Daniels shares new details of her traumatic encounter with Donald Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk)
*  Can we go over that test? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=0.0s)]
*  Would you be willing to go through that testimony with me right now? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  There's no cameras in the court. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=6.16s)]
*  Nobody's seen it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=7.16s)]
*  I mean, I printed out that section of the transcript. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=8.16s)]
*  Is this weird? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=11.92s)]
*  Do you mind doing this? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=12.92s)]
*  I've done a lot weirder. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=13.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=14.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=15.92s)]
*  So I'm going to be. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=16.92s)]
*  I have to put my glasses on. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=19.92s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=21.44s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=22.44s)]
*  Stormy Daniels' testimony in the criminal trial of former President Donald Trump was [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=23.44s)]
*  as consequential to the case as it was just show stopping for everybody who heard about [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=29.2s)]
*  it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=33.96s)]
*  We're going to recount that testimony here now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=34.96s)]
*  And I'm interrupting right now and not just jumping into it straight away, mostly because [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=37.88s)]
*  I need to warn you that some of this conversation is about to be graphic. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=41.4s)]
*  In these next couple of segments in particular, the conversation will not be appropriate for [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=45.64s)]
*  all audiences. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=49.56s)]
*  So if you are squeamish or if you're watching with kids or if you for any reason just don't [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=50.8s)]
*  want to hear descriptions of unwanted sexual contact, this is your cue to check out and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  come back and join us in a few minutes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=61.68s)]
*  But with that said, here we go. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Stormy Daniels with her own testimony and me very awkwardly playing the part of Susan [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=65.52s)]
*  Hoffinger, the prosecutor who questioned Ms. Daniels on direct examination. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=71.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=75.96s)]
*  This is on your direct examination. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=78.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=79.6s)]
*  Because at the end of this is when they asked for the trial. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=80.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=82.16s)]
*  I'll be the prosecutor and you be you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=83.16s)]
*  You're good, Susan. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=86.6s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=87.6s)]
*  What happened when you left the bathroom? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  When I came out of the bathroom, I expected to exit, go around the bed and back out to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=92.12s)]
*  where we had been sitting and talking and hopefully say, okay, time to go. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=96.32s)]
*  I've been here long enough. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  That was actually when I realized how long I had been there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=101.72s)]
*  And when I opened the bathroom door to come out, Mr. Trump had come into the bedroom and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  was on the bed, basically between myself and the exit. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  What was he wearing at the time? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  His boxer shorts and a t-shirt. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=113.72s)]
*  What was your reaction to seeing him like that? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=115.56s)]
*  At first I was just startled, like a jump scare. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=117.68s)]
*  I wasn't expecting someone to be there, especially mine. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=120.4s)]
*  It's a lot of clothing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  And that's when I had moments where I felt, that's when I, sorry, that's when I had that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  moment where I felt the room spin in slow motion. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  I felt the blood basically leave my hands and feet and almost like if you stand up too [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=132.88s)]
*  fast and everything kind of spins. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=136.46s)]
*  That happened too. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=139.0s)]
*  Then I just thought, oh God, what did I misread to get here? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=140.2s)]
*  Because the intention was pretty clear. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=145.08s)]
*  Somebody stripped down to their underwear and posing on the bed like waiting for you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=147.64s)]
*  I'm just going to stop for a second. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=151.84s)]
*  When you say the blood left your hands and feet, like you stand up too fast, everything [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=153.82s)]
*  spinned, you mean that you were shocked? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=158.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=163.12s)]
*  You were just surprised that he had come into the bedroom and had taken off his clothes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=164.12s)]
*  Honestly, even if he had his clothes on, I still would have been startled. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=169.04s)]
*  Then when I realized that he was minus a lot of clothing, then I was just like, oh no, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=173.88s)]
*  what's happening? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=181.84s)]
*  So, the prosecutor continues, what happened when you came out of the bathroom? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=182.84s)]
*  Did he stay on the bed? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=186.24s)]
*  When I exited, he was just up on the bed like this. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  And then I did a pose and I won't because I'm not wearing pants. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=191.0s)]
*  I say I have made them a joke sometimes that he was doing his best Burt Reynolds. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=194.64s)]
*  Oh, he kind of extended himself on the bed like to show you the length of his body? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=199.48s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=203.76s)]
*  Was he joking? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=204.76s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  I wish. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  That would have actually made it better. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=210.67999999999998s)]
*  Was there a bare skin rug? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  There was not. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=214.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=215.04s)]
*  Returning to the transcript, what happened after that? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=216.04s)]
*  When I went to step around, I laughed nervously and tried to make a joke of it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=220.2s)]
*  And step around and leave. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=224.48s)]
*  Even though I was moving like I was in a fun house, I felt like I was in slow motion. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=226.11999999999998s)]
*  I thought to myself, great, I put myself in this bad situation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=229.88s)]
*  Like what did I do? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  How did I misread everything? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  He stood up between me and the door, not in a threatening manner. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=236.88s)]
*  He didn't come at me. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=240.2s)]
*  He didn't rush at me. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=241.2s)]
*  He didn't put his hands on me and nothing like that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  I said, I have to go. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=244.76s)]
*  I got to go. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=246.44s)]
*  He said, I thought we were getting somewhere. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=247.78s)]
*  We were talking and I thought you were serious about what you wanted. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=250.88s)]
*  If you ever want to get out of that trailer park, basically, I was offended because I [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=254.02s)]
*  never lived in a trailer park. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=258.32s)]
*  Now at this point in the testimony, there are objections and there's a sidebar with [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=259.90000000000003s)]
*  the judge. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  You volunteer here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=267.14s)]
*  He was not physically coercing me. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=269.06s)]
*  No. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=272.06s)]
*  Are you at that point trying to establish that you didn't want to do it but he wasn't [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=273.06s)]
*  making you do it? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=278.18s)]
*  He wasn't... [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=281.3s)]
*  I didn't want to ever say that it was any sort of rape or that he used a weapon or physical [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=282.3s)]
*  violence or force. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=289.82s)]
*  Also, I could have taken him. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=290.82s)]
*  But you said, I put myself in this bad situation. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=295.38s)]
*  What is the badness of the situation? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=300.38s)]
*  I had an ex who also worked at a PR firm. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=302.1s)]
*  He had these little pearls of wisdom. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=306.7s)]
*  The press will always use the picture of you looking the worst, not the one of you looking [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=310.62s)]
*  the best. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=313.38000000000005s)]
*  Those sorts of things. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=314.38000000000005s)]
*  Put yourself in a bad situation and bad things happen. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=315.38000000000005s)]
*  Put yourself in a bad situation. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=317.98s)]
*  He used to say that to me all the time. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=318.98s)]
*  Don't get in a car with your friends who've been drinking. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=320.46000000000004s)]
*  Then it's your fault. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=322.66s)]
*  Something like, put yourself in a bad situation. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=323.66s)]
*  I had put myself in a bad situation. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=325.70000000000005s)]
*  But how did I misread it? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=328.54s)]
*  For friends who waste it, falling down drunk and you get in the car, you know they're drunk. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=332.34000000000003s)]
*  I was like, what cute and I missed. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  It told me to expect when I came out of that bathroom that he was there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=339.22s)]
*  After the sidebar, the prosecutor says you were both standing up at this time? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=345.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=350.5s)]
*  And what happened next briefly? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=351.86s)]
*  I think I just blacked it out. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=353.94000000000005s)]
*  Now here's something I want to say. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=356.1s)]
*  I think that they have a typo here. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=357.86s)]
*  I didn't say blacked out. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=360.38000000000005s)]
*  They've taken that and run with it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=362.22s)]
*  If you go back and look at my older interviews where I have the exact same thing, blocked [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=363.58000000000004s)]
*  it out. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=367.54s)]
*  So you think that what you actually said was I just think I blocked it out? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=368.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=372.3s)]
*  Because blacked out means I fainted. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=373.3s)]
*  I never lost consciousness. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=374.90000000000003s)]
*  I think I just blocked it out. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=376.62s)]
*  Well your next line in the transcript is I was not drunk. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=378.22s)]
*  Yeah, but people have taken this and run with it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=380.94s)]
*  Oh, you blacked out. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=383.78000000000003s)]
*  You woke up on the bed. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=385.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=386.90000000000003s)]
*  No, it blocked it out. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  Go back and look at old interviews. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=388.90000000000003s)]
*  It's the same. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=389.90000000000003s)]
*  I know I have an accent, but I think I just blocked it out. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  I was not drugged. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=394.74s)]
*  I never insinuated that I was on drugs. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=395.74s)]
*  I was not drunk and I never said anything of that sort. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=397.9s)]
*  I just don't remember. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=400.85999999999996s)]
*  And what you mean then again, there's some objections there that happen between the lawyers [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=403.17999999999995s)]
*  and the judge. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=407.21999999999997s)]
*  But what they're discussing there is whether you are implying that you had been drugged [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  or that you had been drugged. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=414.41999999999996s)]
*  It seems to me like what you're really trying to say is there's parts of the sexual encounter [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=416.9s)]
*  that I don't remember even now and that's because I blocked them out. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=421.29999999999995s)]
*  I have to tell you, Rachel, like, and I did write about this in my book. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=425.38s)]
*  When I was going and meeting with prosecutors over and over, and they were nice people, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=429.38s)]
*  they tried to be gentle with me. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=433.85999999999996s)]
*  They were asking me the questions over and over because they wanted to make sure that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=437.94s)]
*  they were doing their job correctly. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=441.09999999999997s)]
*  They were also probably trying to prepare me for how awful the defense was going to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=442.85999999999996s)]
*  be for me, although no one could have prepared me for how awful that woman was to me and [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=445.97999999999996s)]
*  how much she is such a mean or try to. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=450.7s)]
*  They asked me such like horrific specific questions like, did his tongue dart in and [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=456.58s)]
*  out of your mouth? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=464.62s)]
*  And I don't even know if you can use some of this. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=466.26s)]
*  You can just cut it out. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=467.86s)]
*  When he was touching your breast, did he like flick or roll or pinch your nipples? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=469.46s)]
*  Like what did his skin feel like? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=473.65999999999997s)]
*  Can you describe it? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=476.06s)]
*  Things that would prove, you know, when he said he didn't use a condom, well, what did [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=477.86s)]
*  you do with the semen? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=483.42s)]
*  And that made me remember things that I didn't remember until then. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=485.42s)]
*  Like, oh, I remember being in the car going back and having to wipe it off my leg. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=488.74s)]
*  Like, this is the graphic stuff that is not in the testimony that could have been. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=492.90000000000003s)]
*  As I remembered more of that, it still makes me, it narrows down the window of what I remember [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=500.3s)]
*  and don't remember. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=506.42s)]
*  There's still a tiny part that I don't. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=508.42s)]
*  And if what I have locked out, I have now started to remember is so terrible, what am [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=510.46000000000004s)]
*  I still not remembering? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=516.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=517.98s)]
*  Why do you think you have blocked some of it out? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=518.98s)]
*  Everything I just said. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=523.5s)]
*  And just your brain essentially protecting you from the memory? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=524.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=528.7s)]
*  I thought that there was something wrong with me or like that I didn't, I didn't say this [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=530.5400000000001s)]
*  stuff because I thought people would say that I was lying or making up. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=536.98s)]
*  Well, you'd remember if something in that pack will happen to you. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=541.58s)]
*  That was then. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=545.0600000000001s)]
*  And as I've gotten older and I've met people that have gone through similar things or I've [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=546.0600000000001s)]
*  talked to therapists about this, they're like, no, that's a defense mechanism. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=550.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=553.46s)]
*  It's way more common for you not to remember these pieces than for you to remember it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=554.46s)]
*  And it made me feel a little bit better in a messed up way or a little more normal. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=560.6600000000001s)]
*  But I'm not, I'm not a liar. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=566.0600000000001s)]
*  Stormy Daniels is my guest this evening. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=572.0600000000001s)]
*  I should tell you, we have reached out to the Trump campaign to ask for comment. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=573.86s)]
*  They have not responded. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_n9uQnH6wYk&t=577.02s)]
