# Russian influence becomes a feature of American elections when Trump is on the ballot
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw)
*  We shouldn't have to deal with any presidential candidates having secret communications with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=0.0s)]
*  a foreign dictator who is hostile to the United States, who is trying to determine who we [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=5.92s)]
*  choose as our next president. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=11.4s)]
*  That just shouldn't happen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=15.06s)]
*  But in the Trump era of Republican Party politics, this is now familiar. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=18.84s)]
*  In the 2016 election, we know that the Russian government interfered in the election to help [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=24.88s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=28.56s)]
*  They hacked and leaked documents from his opponent's campaign. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=29.56s)]
*  They mounted a big propaganda campaign, impersonating Americans, trying to mess with us, trying [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=31.4s)]
*  to turn the election toward Trump. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=36.04s)]
*  We also know in 2016 that Trump's campaign chairman was, during the campaign, sharing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=38.32s)]
*  proprietary non-public information from the Trump campaign with a Russian intelligence [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  officer, while Russian intelligence was mounting that operation against us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=48.64s)]
*  Then four years later, it was the 2020 election, and we know that Russia once again interfered [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  on behalf of Trump. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  That time, it was Trump's personal lawyer working with a sanctioned Kremlin agent to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=59.68s)]
*  try to derail Joe Biden's campaign against Trump. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=65.5s)]
*  Then now, four years later, happening again, now in the 2024 election, we've got Russia [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=69.96s)]
*  seemingly doing more than they've ever done. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=75.52s)]
*  They are straight up paying pro-Trump podcasters and media personalities. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=78.22s)]
*  We've got Russia making deep fake videos about Kamala Harris supposedly hurting someone [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=84.0s)]
*  in a hit-and-run accident and Tim Walz supposedly abusing one of his students. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=89.28s)]
*  Both of those videos are completely fake, but both circulated very widely online, and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=94.16s)]
*  both of them are now officially considered by U.S. intelligence agencies to have been [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=98.64s)]
*  created by Russia. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=102.6s)]
*  We've got Russian military intelligence paying and directing an American expat to make fake [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=105.16s)]
*  American-seeming news websites and to produce conspiracy theory videos that have been promoted [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=110.24s)]
*  widely by pro-Trump personalities and media outlets. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  Now we've got the director of national intelligence coming out and saying the recent fake video [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=119.96s)]
*  of ballots cast for Trump supposedly being destroyed in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  fake video, too, is an operation of the Russian government. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=130.12s)]
*  All designed to help Trump and hurt Harris and make us not believe in our own democracy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=135.8s)]
*  In 2016, it was Trump's campaign chairman talking to Russian intelligence while they [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=142.68s)]
*  did their campaign to help Trump. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=148.36s)]
*  2020, it was Trump's lawyer talking to the Russians while they did their campaign to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=150.0s)]
*  help Trump. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=154.08s)]
*  Who's the contact person this time for the Trump campaign while Russia's doing it again? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=155.4s)]
*  Cheaper to cut out the middleman. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=163.08s)]
*  Ah, this time it's Trump himself talking to Putin while Putin is mounting this big new [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=164.6s)]
*  effort to try to get Trump elected. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=169.52s)]
*  Reported in Bob Woodward's most recent book, at least seven times, excuse me, have talked [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=171.24s)]
*  as many as seven times since Trump left office as president. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=176.04s)]
*  When asked if it was true, Trump said, quote, I don't talk about that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=182.16s)]
*  Remarkable message discipline from him on this subject and only this subject. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=186.68s)]
*  What else is he so tight lipped about? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  In addition to Trump, it's also reportedly Elon Musk, Trump's top funder and cheerleader, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=195.64s)]
*  who has reportedly not only been talking secretly to Putin while Putin has been mounting this [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=201.67999999999998s)]
*  effort to try to get Trump elected, he's Musk specifically has also been talking to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  Putin's first deputy chief of staff. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=210.83999999999997s)]
*  Why would he be talking to that guy specifically in the Russian government? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  I don't know, but he is the specific guy in the Russian government who's apparently in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=217.04s)]
*  charge of operations targeting the American public. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=220.04s)]
*  Like say for this election. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  The guy who orchestrated the whole fake news websites that look like American news outlets, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=227.04s)]
*  that guy who's running that part of the pro Trump Russian campaign operation is in frequent [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=231.64s)]
*  communication with Elon Musk now. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=238.32s)]
*  While that campaign is underway, while Elon Musk has taken a leading role in the Trump [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  campaign. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=245.84s)]
*  That's who Elon Musk has been talking to while Russia has been doing this stuff. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=247.0s)]
*  Wonder what they talk about when they talk. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=252.68s)]
*  When the Republican candidate and his top funder are reportedly in frequent and secret [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=257.32s)]
*  communication with our country's most determined enemy, while that enemy is messing with us [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=263.16s)]
*  in our election to help the Republican campaign win. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  How do you play that wild card in this hand that we've been dealt? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=274.2s)]
*  Might help to check in with somebody who knows how Russia works, who has personal experience [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=278.2s)]
*  with it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=282.12s)]
*  Victoria Nuland retired this year after more than three decades of government service as [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=283.24s)]
*  the number she retired as the number three ranking official at the US State Department. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=287.4s)]
*  In her time in government service, she also became a top target of Putin and Russia's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=291.88s)]
*  intelligence agencies. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=297.48s)]
*  Putin's regime bugged her cell phone. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=299.48s)]
*  They leaked recordings of her calls with other diplomats in an attempt to undermine her relationship [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  and America's relationship with our allies. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=307.23999999999995s)]
*  Russian state media has consistently portrayed her as a kind of uber powerful American bogeyman. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=309.79999999999995s)]
*  They've blamed her, for example, for single handedly causing the revolution that ousted [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=317.79999999999995s)]
*  Ukraine's pro-Putin president in 2013. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=322.2s)]
*  That was 2013. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=325.64s)]
*  They're still blaming her for that now. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=326.64s)]
*  Victoria Nuland is an American government expert on Russian aggression. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=329.4s)]
*  She also personally knows what it's like to experience it firsthand. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=334.84s)]
*  Joining us now is Victoria Nuland, career diplomat, recently retired as Undersecretary [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=338.84s)]
*  of State for Political Affairs. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=342.96s)]
*  Madam Ambassador, thank you very much for being here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=344.84s)]
*  I know that TV interviews aren't your favorite thing in the world. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=346.64s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  It's great to be back with you and to talk about this issue as you and I did in 2016 [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  as we did as well in 2020. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=356.64s)]
*  This is the third election in a row in which Russia has tried to interfere to try to get [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  Trump into the White House. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=364.44s)]
*  How do you assess the magnitude and the type of interference they're attempting this year [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=366.68s)]
*  compared to what they've done in his previous two elections? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=373.24s)]
*  Well, as you said earlier, Rachel, he's at it again. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  He's not even trying to hide his hand, and he has far more sophisticated tools. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=383.4s)]
*  His AI is better, so he can make these fake videos. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=388.23999999999995s)]
*  He has done things like spend $10 million trying to buy American influencers and get [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  them parroting his lines and not even know it's happening. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  But he's also got a brand new, very, very powerful tool, which is Elon Musk and X. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  In 2020, the social media companies worked hard with the U.S. government to try to do [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=408.92s)]
*  content moderation, to try to catch this stuff as it was happening. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=414.44s)]
*  But this time, we have Elon Musk talking directly to the Kremlin and ensuring that every time [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=419.16s)]
*  the Russians put out something like this, it gets 5 million views on X before anybody [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=425.0s)]
*  can catch it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=429.72s)]
*  So it's quite dangerous, although I do think the American electorate has gotten more sophisticated [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=430.72s)]
*  and more savvy about this stuff. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=436.46000000000004s)]
*  If an American citizen is talking to senior officials in the Russian government about [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  anything, aren't they supposed to be reporting those contacts to the U.S. government? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=444.44s)]
*  And if so, is that just a nice thing to do, like a patriotic thing to do, or are they [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  required to do that? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=453.36s)]
*  It's not a legal requirement, but it obviously causes some suspicion and question about what [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=457.20000000000005s)]
*  Musk's motives are here, especially because Putin doesn't like it when he thinks we're [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=464.6s)]
*  interfering in his election, which we don't do, despite his views about that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=470.76000000000005s)]
*  But clearly, he's interfering in our election, and Musk is helping him. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=477.6s)]
*  And Musk is also helping Trump. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  So now you have this triumvirate all on the same team. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=484.04s)]
*  And Putin doesn't think it's important to try to look even with any semblance of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=489.68s)]
*  even-handedness in this election. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  He knows what he wants. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=499.04s)]
*  He wants Donald Trump elected. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=500.08s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about something else that was reported today in The New York Times, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=501.88s)]
*  which is that, according to The Times' reporting, one of the ideas that's circulating in Trump's [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=507.68s)]
*  campaign is that if he's elected, they should get rid of FBI background checks for security [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=514.28s)]
*  clearances, that instead the White House alone or the White House maybe with a private company [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=519.1600000000001s)]
*  that they appoint for this purpose should decide who gets security clearances without [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=525.44s)]
*  allowing the FBI to review, for example, people's past convictions, people's connections with [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=529.76s)]
*  foreign governments, people's susceptibility to blackmail or other reasons they might be [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=537.72s)]
*  denied a security clearance. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=541.76s)]
*  That feels like a very risky move in any circumstance. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  Given the circumstance that we're just discussing right here, it seems almost insanely reckless. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=549.08s)]
*  But I wanted to get your take on it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=555.76s)]
*  Insanely reckless is the right way to put it, Rachel. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=560.64s)]
*  That would mean that there would be no independent check on who anybody around Trump was talking [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=563.1600000000001s)]
*  to, might be influenced by, might be paid by. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=570.0s)]
*  And it would put Putin, it would put Xi Jinping, it would put Kim Jong-un directly into the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=574.36s)]
*  Situation Room and into Donald Trump's brain. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=581.36s)]
*  And that's very, very dangerous. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=585.5999999999999s)]
*  But equally dangerous, if I may, is what Trump is saying about what he would do inside the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=587.88s)]
*  United States, that he would turn the U.S. police, that he would turn maybe the U.S. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=594.7s)]
*  military against his enemies, that he would obviously use the courts to go after folks [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=601.7s)]
*  that oppose him. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=607.7s)]
*  He is already suing members of the media and that he would deny licenses to media organs [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=609.7s)]
*  that oppose him. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=616.0s)]
*  Who does this sound like? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=617.62s)]
*  It sounds like his friend Vladimir Putin and the way Putin operates in Russia and what [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=619.24s)]
*  Putin did to the tiny fledgling democracy that was starting to sprout in Russia. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=624.88s)]
*  So, Trump is also taking Putin lessons, as autocrats around the world are. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=631.88s)]
*  The idea of an American led by an admirer of Putin who puts the United States, not as [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=638.42s)]
*  the leader of the free world, but rather into effectively a sort of axis with the dictator [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=645.24s)]
*  of Russia and the dictator in China and North Korea. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=650.72s)]
*  And I mean, to join, for the United States to be allied with those countries instead [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=654.72s)]
*  of our traditional alliances, I'm not sure people have absorbed the magnitude of what [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=659.28s)]
*  you're just describing there. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=664.16s)]
*  But maybe we will. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=665.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKvVLDcgnw&t=666.16s)]
