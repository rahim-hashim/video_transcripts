# Citing Political Betrayal, Voto Latino Launches Campaign To Unseat Kyrsten Sinema
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk)
*  Over the weekend, the Arizona Democratic Party made an incredibly took an incredibly rare step to rebuke Senator Sinema. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=0.0s)]
*  They officially censured her for her role in helping Republicans stop that voting rights bill. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=9.84s)]
*  The head of the Arizona Democratic Party said in a statement, quote, The ramifications of failing to pass federal legislation that protects our constituents right to vote are too large and far reaching. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=16.2s)]
*  While we take no pleasure in this announcement, the Arizona Democratic Party executive board has decided to formally censure Senator Sinema as a result of her failure to do whatever it takes to ensure the health of our democracy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=26.92s)]
*  We do not see this from Democratic parties. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=41.0s)]
*  We do not see this very often at all from state Democratic parties about an incumbent Democratic member of Congress, let alone the United States Senate. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=44.24s)]
*  It is something we're used to seeing in Republican Party politics recently, particularly in this schismatic era of the Republican Party becoming the Trump Party. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=52.63999999999999s)]
*  And Trump's takeover has led to many attempts to exile Republicans who don't pledge full fealty to him. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  So we've seen a lot of this on the Republican side. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=68.16s)]
*  Democrats rarely, if ever, take this kind of an action, this kind of action against an incumbent. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=70.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, now tonight, there's something new. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=76.92s)]
*  Tonight, we can report exclusively that one of the nation's largest and most effective Latino grassroots organizations, Voto Latino, is announcing a big ad campaign to unseat Kirsten Sinema in her next primary and get her out of the United States Senate. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=78.92s)]
*  They've launched a new website. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=95.64s)]
*  It's called AdiosCinema.org. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  Senator Sinema is not up for reelection for another two years. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=101.08s)]
*  We still have an entire midterm election before voters will even get the chance to cast a ballot against her. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=104.32s)]
*  But Arizona Democrats and national progressive groups and now this very influential Latino voters group, they are preparing for that fight. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=110.27999999999999s)]
*  I did not expect it to go this direction, but it has with an exclamation point. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  Joining us now is Maria Teresa Kumar. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  She is president and CEO of Voto Latino. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=124.16s)]
*  Maria Teresa, it's really nice to see you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  Thanks for making time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=128.12s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=130.04s)]
*  So I don't mean to put Voto Latino and Indivisible in the same box. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=131.44s)]
*  Everybody has a different remit, a different mission and a different approach to these politics. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=135.16s)]
*  I do, however, think that Voto Latino under your leadership and Indivisible under Ezra's leadership and others, both share a very practical been there, done that experienced approach to politics. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  That's why it seems like a big deal to me. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=152.0s)]
*  It seems like it must have been a hard decision to take a big stand like this against a serving Democratic senator and what amounts to a very swingy state. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Arizona is a very swingy state. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=164.84s)]
*  And what was able to get Sinema over to the top to go to the Senate was literally the Latino vote. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=166.32s)]
*  And Rachel, we did not make this decision lightly. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=174.04s)]
*  We had conference calls. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=177.48s)]
*  We spoke to our board. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=179.0s)]
*  We spoke to individuals. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=180.12s)]
*  We engaged and we engaged with Senator Sinema. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=181.12s)]
*  We were very clear on the day of the vote where we stood and what we needed her to do. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=184.32s)]
*  We had her back when she needed us, the Latino community. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=189.04s)]
*  And she demonstrated that even though Arizona was ground zero for the big lie, the big audit that was fabricated, that was not true. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  She did not take seriously this idea that voting is the essence. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=201.92s)]
*  And as the president said, the threshold of our democracy where millions of Arizona and Latinos will be disenfranchised, millions of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  Americans across the country, if we do not have fair, free elections at the federal level, where everybody, regardless of party, is playing by the same rules. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=213.88000000000002s)]
*  Has Senator Sinema been willing to engage with you, with Voto Latino, with other groups that have had such a problem with her recent voting record and her recent actions on issues like this? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=222.56s)]
*  Has she been willing to talk? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=233.56s)]
*  She did on the very day that we were the big vote on the filibuster, whether or not we were even going to bring this to the floor. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=236.24s)]
*  We had a conversation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  We engaged with her, myself and several other Latino leaders. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=244.84s)]
*  And she referred to us to the 20 minute speech that she made and said that she was very clear. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=248.0s)]
*  And we were clear that we needed to make sure that we are all eligible to participate in our democracy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=252.8s)]
*  And again, everybody has a different perspective on what we should be doing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=260.16s)]
*  But when we look at the ramifications of what's happening at the state level on the rights of individuals, of young people, of people of color, it is disproportionately the Republican Party who is hell-bent on making sure that not everybody has equal access. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  Last year, in 2020, Rachel, we had all 50 states, regardless of political stripes, every single secretary of state verified a fair and free election. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=281.88s)]
*  But it was the people who voted. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=292.0s)]
*  It was young people, it was people of color, Latinos, African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans that voted in record number, this multi-generational America that came together to oust Trump, very clearly saying we want a different direction of our country. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=293.64s)]
*  And instead of Republicans celebrating this, instead of Sinema making sure that we can do this again, she is the first person that is basically the obstacle to ensure and get rid of the filibuster and have access to the voting booth and ensure that our democracy, little D democracy, continues to thrive. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=306.48s)]
*  In terms of big D Democrats versus small D democracy, I was looking at some of the polling for Senator Sinema at home, and it's terrible. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  One recent poll found that it was a poll of Arizona Democrats. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=333.68s)]
*  72 percent of Arizona Democrats would prefer that there was a different candidate for her seat than her next time around. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=337.23999999999995s)]
*  Another poll found that the best case scenario for her would be a very crowded primary for her seat, and in a very crowded primary, she would still lose the primary by four points. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=344.12s)]
*  If I'm Senator Sinema's campaign staff, political staff, and I'm looking at those kind of numbers among Arizona Democrats, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  and I'm looking at audio cinema dot org, I'm looking at this website that you've put up in this ad campaign that you're starting and the kind of similar arguments that we're hearing from so many people that represents key constituents that helped get her elected the last time, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  I might bail on the Democratic Party, become a Republican, potentially, I guess, become an independent, try to do this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=375.88s)]
*  The Lisa Murkowski path where you maybe don't fit in with the state party, but you try to hold on to your seat anyway. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=383.56s)]
*  Do you think that's a possibility? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=388.8s)]
*  So the Lisa Murkowski model, the difference is that you don't have a large ethnic population where she's from. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=390.96s)]
*  In Arizona, 30 percent of the electoral base is Latino, and by the time that Senator Sinema is once again on the ballot, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=397.36s)]
*  you're going to have 162,000 newly minted eligible voters that have just turned 18 within the last four years. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=404.8s)]
*  The fact that, and just to remind viewers, President Biden won Arizona by less than 12,000 votes. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=412.28s)]
*  These are absolutely opportunities at the margins, and it's going to, as anything, it's a contested primary, it opens up the field to find new dynamic [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=419.79999999999995s)]
*  voices that really serve the interest of the Arizona people. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=427.84s)]
*  We have to remind folks that it wasn't just the filibuster, but the filibuster, if we cannot access the voting booth, everything else that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  Arizonans say that they care about, whether it's the environment because they don't have they don't have water, whether it's access to health care, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  whether it's access to fair minimum wage. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=444.72s)]
*  None of that is possible because there's an obstructionist government right now that is being held by the minority party that is being espoused by the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=446.48s)]
*  minority of Americans, not the majority of Americans in this case. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZvcDOS4dk&t=453.08s)]
