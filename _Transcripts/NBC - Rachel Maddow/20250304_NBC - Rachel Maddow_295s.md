# 'For the record...': Rachel Maddow sets the record straight on Trump address falsehoods
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04)
*  The president, in his, what we believe was ad-libbing, we did not have prepared remarks [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=0.0s)]
*  from the president, which is unusual. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=7.2s)]
*  White houses usually distribute prepared remarks, so we don't know what was digressing from [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=9.6s)]
*  those remarks and what was ad-libbed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  But the president did repeatedly seem to be ad-libbing when he was remarking on the expected [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=16.16s)]
*  impact of the economic decisions he's already made six weeks in, saying that the American [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=23.04s)]
*  people would have to bear with him, that there would be a little disturbance, that there [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=28.2s)]
*  would be an adjustment period. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=31.8s)]
*  And again, he said a little disturbance, essentially suggesting that the roiling that we saw in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=33.8s)]
*  the markets is something that he knows he caused, but he hopes people will not mind. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  For the record, the worst inflation in this country was in 1980. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=46.96s)]
*  For the record, the economy that he was left by President Biden was not a catastrophe. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=52.64s)]
*  It was literally the best economy in the world. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=58.24s)]
*  It was described by The Economist magazine as the envy of the world. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=61.88s)]
*  That was the economy that was left to Donald Trump by Joe Biden. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=66.04s)]
*  For the record, Social Security is not paying benefits in large numbers to 300-year-old [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=70.08s)]
*  people or 250-year-old people or 200-year-old people or 150-year-old people. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=75.16s)]
*  In fact, the idea of Social Security as a bastion of massive fraud and overpayment [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=81.36s)]
*  is completely false. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=86.84s)]
*  For the record, U.S. auto company CEOs are not psyched and delighted and so excited about [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=89.2s)]
*  President Trump's economic policies, including his tariffs. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=97.08s)]
*  Take, for example, the CEO of Ford, Jim Farley, who said that Trump's tariff policies would [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=100.24s)]
*  in the U.S. auto industry that, quote, we've never seen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=106.44s)]
*  The president flat out lied about U.S. versus European spending to support what used to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=111.36s)]
*  be our allies in Ukraine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=118.32s)]
*  U.S. has committed about $125 billion to Ukraine's defense. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=120.44s)]
*  Europe has committed about $259 billion. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=125.68s)]
*  The president radically, radically misstating the character and quantity of our relative [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=130.28s)]
*  support for what used to be our ally now appears to be only Europe's ally and no longer ours. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=136.4s)]
*  For the record, Joe Biden did not close over 100 power plants. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=142.36s)]
*  There were more utility-sized power plants up and running in the United States when Joe [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=146.08s)]
*  Biden left office than when he achieved office. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=150.44s)]
*  For the record, there is no E.V. mandate. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=155.08s)]
*  For the record, oil and gas production in the United States hit all-time records under [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=159.2s)]
*  President Joe Biden. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=164.11999999999998s)]
*  For the record, even Doge has never claimed that they have saved hundreds of billions [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  of dollars in savings. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=173.32s)]
*  The largest items they have claimed to achieve as savings in the U.S. budget have been debunked [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=175.44s)]
*  and they've been taken down, but even they don't falsely claim hundreds of billions of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=180.72s)]
*  dollars' worth of savings. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=185.72s)]
*  For the record, and this is disgusting, the president made a spectacle out of praising [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=188.2s)]
*  a young man who thus far survived pediatric cancer as if the president had something to [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=195.79999999999998s)]
*  do with that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=202.26s)]
*  This was in the midst of him praising Doge. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=203.26s)]
*  The Doge cuts, among other things, have cut off funding for ongoing research into pediatric [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=205.64s)]
*  cancer. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=211.32s)]
*  For the record, I will note that Donald Trump did admit in his remarks today explicitly [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=213.3s)]
*  that Elon Musk is the head of Doge. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=219.38s)]
*  And while that comes as no surprise to anybody who's been following the facts of this matter, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=222.62s)]
*  that will end up in court because that is directly contrary to what the administration [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=227.78s)]
*  has overtly sworn to a federal judge about the leadership of Doge. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=232.22s)]
*  I should also note, and this doesn't have to be for the record, I'll just note it for [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=242.9s)]
*  our own experience tonight that at that point in the speech when the president talked about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  how we will no longer be ruled by unelected bureaucrats, Democrats in the chamber pointed [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=251.54s)]
*  and laughed at Elon Musk. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=257.08s)]
*  Unelected bureaucrat. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=259.06s)]
*  Nicole Wallace, I'm sorry to dump a lot of fact checks there and that's not even scratching [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  the surface of the things that need to be fact checked there. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=266.86s)]
*  That's literally what was off the top of my head. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=270.1s)]
*  So there's more to say along those lines. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04&t=272.90000000000003s)]
