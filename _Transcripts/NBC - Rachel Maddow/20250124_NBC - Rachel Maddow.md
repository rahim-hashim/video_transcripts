# 'Appalling': January 6 prosecutor voices outrage at Trump pardoning 'very dangerous people'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94)
*  From a Justice Department sentencing memo that was filed in court last year, quote, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=0.0s)]
*  defendant Christopher Joseph Quaglin was among the most violent of the January 6 rioters. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=4.2s)]
*  He viciously assaulted numerous officers in this court, convicted him of six counts of assault, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=8.76s)]
*  two counts of robbery, obstruction of the congressional certification vote, and other offenses. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=13.32s)]
*  On at least a dozen occasions, he stood face to face with officers as he screamed at, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=18.12s)]
*  pushed without stretched arms, punched, swatted, and slapped officers, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=23.92s)]
*  pushed bike racks into officers, and even choked one officer to the ground. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=27.72s)]
*  He used his body as a battering ram and employed a stolen police riot shield against the officers [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=32.6s)]
*  in an attempt to force his way into the building. He sprayed several officers directly in the face [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=37.64s)]
*  with chemical irritant. He joined the collective mob pushes against the police line. In total, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=42.44s)]
*  he was on Capitol grounds wreaking havoc for more than three hours. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=47.96s)]
*  Due to his egregious criminal conduct on January 6, his refusal to accept responsibility and the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  need to deter him and others from further wrongdoing, the government recommends that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=57.32s)]
*  the court sentence him to 168 months of incarceration. That sentencing memo was written by a Justice [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=61.4s)]
*  Department prosecutor whose name is Ashley Akers. And the Trump-appointed judge who heard that case [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=70.2s)]
*  and considered that memo agreed and sentenced the defendant to a dozen years in prison just shy of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=75.56s)]
*  what the prosecutors had asked for. Now, less than a year after that, he's out. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=81.64s)]
*  And one of the last things Ashley Akers did as a prosecutor for the U.S. Department of Justice [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=90.12s)]
*  was submit filings to dismiss charges against defendants in cases she spent years building. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=94.44s)]
*  Dismiss the charges because these people have been now pardoned by Donald Trump. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=102.84s)]
*  I say that's one of the last things she did for the U.S. Justice Department because after [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=106.92s)]
*  more than seven years as a federal prosecutor and involvement in many January 6 cases, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=111.24s)]
*  Ashley Akers left the U.S. Justice Department today. She's here tonight for her first television [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=116.36s)]
*  interview since leaving her post. Ms. Akers, thanks very much for being here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=124.6s)]
*  Thanks for your service. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=125.47999999999999s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=126.6s)]
*  After seven years of the Justice Department, did you want to leave? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=127.56s)]
*  No, I suppose yes because I left. But the circumstances came in a way that I didn't expect. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=132.28s)]
*  Yeah. What is it like to have worked on so many of these January 6 cases? I understand that you [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=140.52s)]
*  may have had as many, if not more, January 6 trials as any prosecutor in the department. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=149.8s)]
*  What is it like to have all of that work and all of those cases and all of those convictions and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=157.08s)]
*  all of those sentences wiped away by the president? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=163.24s)]
*  It was appalling, really. I think that the pardons that happened were disturbing. They [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  were disturbing for a number of reasons. They were disturbing because it condones the violence [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  that you just described and that the prosecutors on the team have been describing for years in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  court. It condones that. And this wasn't ordinary violence. As you described earlier, the police [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=184.52s)]
*  officers who were testifying in trials for years talked about this being the scariest day of their [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=191.0s)]
*  lives. They didn't know if they were going to come home. They talked about this being a medieval [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=196.04s)]
*  battle scene. And not only does it condone violence against those law enforcement officers, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=202.04s)]
*  but it undermines the rule of law. And as judges in our court have continually repeated [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=207.32s)]
*  that the cornerstone of our democracy is the peaceful transition of power from one administration [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=213.96s)]
*  to the next. And the crimes that were pardoned from January 6th were crimes that disrupted that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=219.72s)]
*  peaceful transition of power. The way these pardons were handed down, blanket pardons and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=226.52s)]
*  commutations without regard to criminal records, without regard to the specific crimes that were [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=232.28s)]
*  charged here, without regard to level of violence, without regard to anything else, anything [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=237.24s)]
*  potentially differentiating about these cases. Does that increase the threat that you are talking [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=243.0s)]
*  about? The reason I ask is because I think politically it's being greeted not just as a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=249.79999999999998s)]
*  favor to these individuals, but essentially it's being greeted as an attempted vindication of what [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  they did. Not just an erasure of any accountability for it, but in effect a celebration of what they [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  did. Are you worried about that? I'm worried, Rachel, because Donald Trump pardoned some very, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=266.92s)]
*  very dangerous people. Rioters who point blank bear sprayed officers in the face, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  rioters who beat police officers with a baseball bat, hockey stick, a hammer, a chair leg [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=282.36s)]
*  protruding with nails, rioters who brought firearms to the Capitol on January 6th expecting [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=289.64s)]
*  violence, rioters who choked officers to the ground, who gouged their eyes. So I don't know [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=296.76s)]
*  what's going to happen, but is America safer today after these pardons? Certainly not. Are you worried [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=302.76s)]
*  about FBI agents and Justice Department personnel and prosecutors such as yourself being personally [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=309.96s)]
*  targeted by the people who have just been pardoned and had their sentences commuted? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=317.32s)]
*  I think any prosecutor would say that that is a risk that comes with the job, and I hope not, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=321.96s)]
*  and I hope that these people who are pardoned and given a second chance take it. But the rhetoric [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=326.59999999999997s)]
*  online, the rhetoric from these people that the president pardoned, doesn't suggest that that's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=334.12s)]
*  true. And this rhetoric has held true before January 6th, during January 6th, and after, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=339.56s)]
*  and it's dangerous. There are some January 6th defendants who were charged with or even convicted [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=347.0s)]
*  for other offenses, especially guns and weapons charges, people having sawed off shotguns, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=354.68s)]
*  unregistered AR-15s, fragmentation grenades, explosives, and some of those charges were brought [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=360.2s)]
*  not directly related to their January 6th crimes, but maybe the FBI was at their house searching and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=367.4s)]
*  found those things because they were looking for them because of their involvement in January 6th [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=376.52s)]
*  crimes in the first place. Should we expect that people who have had secondary criminal charges, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=380.91999999999996s)]
*  who've had other courses of criminal charges that weren't necessarily just about their behavior on [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  January 6th, should we expect that those things are going to be in court for a long time while [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=391.24s)]
*  their lawyers try to persuade judges that the January 6th pardons also should expunge [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=395.56s)]
*  any responsibility for the other things they've been charged for? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=402.28s)]
*  I think, Rachel, it's not just their lawyers. It's now the Department of Justice that's asking [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=405.79999999999995s)]
*  courts to interpret this executive order, or excuse me, this pardon order, very broadly. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=410.67999999999995s)]
*  For example, I have a case where two defendants were subject to pretrial supervision. One of them [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=417.08s)]
*  had an ankle monitor. He cut it off. Him and his co-defendant fled the FBI for over a month, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=425.32s)]
*  and so they were charged with a failure to appear. Completely separate offense from January 6th [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=431.88s)]
*  conduct. They failed to appear for their court date. The Department of Justice has now interpreted [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=436.76s)]
*  that and has filed in court such asking the court to dismiss the whole case because the very basis [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=441.64s)]
*  of it was January 6th related. So I think you can expect that this department is going to ask for [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=448.6s)]
*  an incredibly broad reading of the president's pardon. The problem here is that means that if you [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=454.68s)]
*  committed an offense for which you pled guilty or were convicted on January 6th, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=462.36s)]
*  what you just described would imply that the Justice Department under Donald Trump, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=470.92s)]
*  their new position is that any crime that could conceivably described as derivative [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=475.8s)]
*  from something that happened on January 6th, even if it is cutting off an ankle bracelet, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=482.35999999999996s)]
*  even if it is harboring illegal silencers or explosives or other weapons or all these things, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=486.44s)]
*  that people get all of those things expunged, that there's no way to prosecute them for [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=492.91999999999996s)]
*  any derivative or non-derivative crimes. I don't know if the department's going to go that far, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=497.56s)]
*  but the evidence that we have now based on the filings of the department are there are two cases [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=502.2s)]
*  where the department is moving to dismiss in its entirety defendants cases who have fled the FBI [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=507.4s)]
*  in the courts jurisdiction. The Justice Department, people who work with the Justice Department, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=515.24s)]
*  career staff of the department and staffers sort of at all levels have been given a bit of a shock [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=521.24s)]
*  to the system, not just with the change in leadership this week, but also with I think [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=526.6s)]
*  what were some unexpected decisions, one of which related to the DOJ honors program. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=531.88s)]
*  You came to DOJ in the first place through the honors program. Can you explain what that is and [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=537.64s)]
*  and what's just happened to that program? Yeah, it's devastating. What happened to the program was, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  I believe it was yesterday, all DOJ honors hires, recent hires, were sent a somewhat crude email [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=546.8399999999999s)]
*  informing them that they were no longer going to be hired at the department, although they had [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=555.64s)]
*  already been hired. So these are people who already had an offer, already been hired. They had forwent [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=560.68s)]
*  law firm recruiting, they haven't been interviewing, they have jobs at the Department of Justice, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=564.52s)]
*  or at least an offer of a job. They expected and anticipated to work there and they were told this [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=569.64s)]
*  week that they no longer should expect that. It's devastating. One of the only ways to come into the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=576.04s)]
*  Department of Justice as a young lawyer is through the honors program. It's an incredibly prestigious [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=581.56s)]
*  program. It's hard to get in. The people who come in are very bright attorneys and so for those [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=587.56s)]
*  attorneys, top of their class, have all the awards, have all the credentials, decided not to go to a [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=593.3199999999999s)]
*  law firm, decided not to make all the money, they wanted to be public servants and they were hired [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=600.5999999999999s)]
*  as such and now unfortunately they're going to have to find something else. We're also seeing [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=606.4399999999999s)]
*  senior career staffers at the Justice Department, including people who have been [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=612.76s)]
*  seen as sort of the infrastructure of the department in terms of some of the way some of [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=617.0s)]
*  the most complex areas of the law work, essentially shunted into all seemingly into the same office [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=620.28s)]
*  where they're all being told they're now going to work on prosecuting sanctuary cities or some [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=627.56s)]
*  going after local jurisdictions that have proclaimed themselves to be opposed to the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=633.72s)]
*  administration's approach to immigration law enforcement. What do you think the impact of [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=639.16s)]
*  that will be? The intention seems to be to try to make all of those senior people quit. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=644.36s)]
*  That seems to be the intention. I think on the ground in this last week, what it's done is it's [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=649.48s)]
*  just terrified people. Everyone is worried if they're going to be fired or moved. If the goal was [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=654.12s)]
*  to make the department more efficient, I think this had the contrary effect. It's also, I mean, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=660.84s)]
*  in my assessment and I'm not part of this, but it's nonsensical. You have people who are [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=666.76s)]
*  subject matter experts in certain sections who have committed their lives to litigating [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKanROldD94&t=671.96s)]
