# Ukrainians Reel At The Horror Of Russian War Atrocities
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 04, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw)
*  Joining us now to discuss what she witnessed and what the world should do about it is Ukrainian [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=0.0s)]
*  member of parliament, Kira Rudik. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=4.92s)]
*  Ms. Rudik, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=6.92s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=8.84s)]
*  You have often taken time to be with us, and it's hard, and it's the middle of the night, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=9.84s)]
*  but it is harder tonight somehow. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Somehow, even though you have been out there with your phone documenting this war since [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=16.2s)]
*  the beginning, something more has happened now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=19.96s)]
*  Tell us what the world should know about what you saw. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=22.8s)]
*  Hello, Ali. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=26.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=28.16s)]
*  I have seen so many dead bodies today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=30.6s)]
*  I have seen people killed by—with their hands tied behind their backs. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=33.24s)]
*  And I talked to people who survived this, who have seen all of this with their own eyes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=40.56s)]
*  I have talked to women who were raped by Russians, who had their children watch it and their [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=47.08s)]
*  husbands killed. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=55.44s)]
*  I have talked to people whose children were dying of pneumonia because they had to stay [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=57.6s)]
*  in the basement for 39 days without any ray of light. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=63.68s)]
*  I have seen—talked to families whose relatives died and were burned alive. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=68.88s)]
*  We talked to families whose daughters were the ones who were burned by Russians and ran [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=77.08s)]
*  over tanks. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=83.28s)]
*  We have seen so much pain and destruction there that I cannot even begin to tell you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=86.68s)]
*  But the most important was—what happened was that we were able to get international [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=92.04s)]
*  journalists into Buche so they could film it themselves and share the information with [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=96.72s)]
*  the whole world. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=102.48s)]
*  Because what we witness right now is that Russia is already trying to say some obscene [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=104.16s)]
*  things that it is all made up. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=108.8s)]
*  And it is not. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=111.36s)]
*  We are gathering the evidence because every single person will have and will be taken [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=112.72000000000001s)]
*  accountable, will be prosecuted, and will be held to justice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=118.92s)]
*  I have seen people whose houses were destroyed still to the ground. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=125.0s)]
*  And you know, like, the most broken piece was the house that burned down and with only [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=130.84s)]
*  fence staying up. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=139.0s)]
*  And on that fence, there was a sign written by hand put into the plastic file and tied [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=141.48s)]
*  to the fence with the tape, you know? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=149.24s)]
*  And it was saying on this sign, we are peaceful people. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=152.8s)]
*  So people wrote that hopefully that Russians will admit them, that they will avoid death, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=159.44s)]
*  but they did not. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=165.48s)]
*  They were, in fact, peaceful people. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  They were not even resistance. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=169.88000000000002s)]
*  They did not bear arms. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  They just wanted to survive this war, and they did not. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=173.4s)]
*  And for that, we will demand justice. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=177.12s)]
*  We will never forget, and we will never forgive. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  There will be trials. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  There will be lists of soldiers that we are putting together so they will be held accountable. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=186.12s)]
*  And we want right now every single world leader to think twice if they are doing enough, because [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=191.44000000000003s)]
*  we think they are not doing it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  Because right now, at the same time when we are talking, there are people somewhere in [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=200.08s)]
*  the basements. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  There are people being killed with their hands behind their back. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=204.76000000000002s)]
*  There are people being raped because there are places that are occupied by Russians still. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  And we are not getting the weapons that we need to get. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=215.28000000000003s)]
*  Because on the day 40, we are talking about the same things that we need on the day one. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=218.62s)]
*  Because right now, on the day 40, there are still countries that are buying Russian gas [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=224.5s)]
*  and oil, who are basically sponsoring those horrors and terrors that are happening to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=229.06s)]
*  my people. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  Because right now, there are still countries who are hesitating about to help Ukraine or [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=236.34s)]
*  not. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=240.46s)]
*  And I can tell you, like, this is happening right now on everybody's behalf, on everybody's. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=241.78s)]
*  I want you to see this, because this is happening in my country, to my people, to my nation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  This is pure genocide. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  And we do need help to stop this. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=255.17999999999998s)]
*  We do need help to win this war. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=257.26s)]
*  We do need the whole world to stand up as one, to stop hesitating, to stop thinking [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=260.62s)]
*  of what to do, and start acting. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=266.3s)]
*  Start acting, because this needs to stop. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=269.36s)]
*  When you say start acting, there are people concerned that anything that feels like direct [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=274.3s)]
*  military intervention, including no-fly zones or Western NATO troops in Ukraine, will be [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=279.62s)]
*  an escalation that could result in nuclear war. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=288.5s)]
*  What do you tell those people? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=292.14s)]
*  Ali, we are not asking for NATO troops on our grounds. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  We are fighting Russians on the ground very well ourselves. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  We do need weapons, and we do need sanctions on Russian gas and oil. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=301.5s)]
*  We do need weapons to fight them in the air, because what you have shown right now, the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=306.46s)]
*  pictures, they are showing what happens to the houses, to the cities, when they are attacked [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=311.46s)]
*  by missiles. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  We need weapons to protect our skies. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=318.06s)]
*  We will protect them ourselves. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=321.14s)]
*  But please give us these weapons, rent us these weapons, sell them to us for $1 or whatever. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=323.52s)]
*  But we need them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=330.18s)]
*  Otherwise, we will be fighting on the ground, but we will still destroy it from the air. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=331.94s)]
*  And the second point that needs to happen is absolute ban on Russian gas and oil. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=338.22s)]
*  Every single dollar that's getting into Russia is being used to create this terror in Ukraine. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=343.82s)]
*  Every single dollar that is coming from businesses that are operating in Russia is being used [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=352.18s)]
*  to rape women here, to kill children here, to kill innocent people who didn't do anything [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=357.85999999999996s)]
*  wrong, who just exist and make Putin hate us for that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=365.65999999999997s)]
*  This is genocide, and this is happening in the 21st century. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=373.14s)]
*  And when the world was saying never again, I am calling right now for everybody who was [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=376.82s)]
*  saying never again to act on it right now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  Kira Rudek, we have been speaking for a long time, and you have had great force in your [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=388.78s)]
*  arguments and your videos and the fact that you have learned to use a gun that you have [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=394.09999999999997s)]
*  never done before. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=398.11999999999995s)]
*  But something is different tonight. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=399.11999999999995s)]
*  Something is different in your voice and in the matters that you saw in Bucza and that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=401.34s)]
*  you are bearing witness to. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=405.82s)]
*  And we are thankful to you that you have taken the time to share that with us tonight as [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=406.82s)]
*  horrible and horrible as it is. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=410.17999999999995s)]
*  Kira Rudek is a member of the Ukrainian parliament. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=412.29999999999995s)]
*  Please stay safe. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=415.11999999999995s)]
*  Thank you and glory to Ukraine. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skftnaB2UZw&t=416.12s)]
