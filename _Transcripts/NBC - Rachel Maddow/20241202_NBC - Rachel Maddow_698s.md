Video Description: Rachel Maddow talks with Jane Mayer, Washington correspondent for the New Yorker, about her new reporting on Trump secretary of defense pick, Pete Hegseth's disastrous leadership of veterans groups and reports of alcohol abuse. Ongoing reporting into the extent to which Hegseth is compromised as a candidate to lead the Pentagon suggests a lack of diligence by Trump in making his selection.

# Where Trump failed to vet Cabinet picks, journalism finds more scandal
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw)
*  So, there's a new reporting today from legendary reporter Jane Mayer in The New Yorker about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=0.0s)]
*  the man who's been announced as the choice for defense secretary in the incoming administration. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=5.12s)]
*  According to Jane Mayer's new reporting, before Pete Hegseth was hired to be a TV host [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=9.92s)]
*  at the Fox News Channel in 2017, he had been forced out of two small right-wing veterans [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=15.32s)]
*  advocacy organizations that he had been involved in. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  The first one was a group called Veterans for Freedom. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=27.36s)]
*  They hired him on to lead that organization in 2007, according to Mayer's reporting. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=30.8s)]
*  By 2008, the very next year, the group's finances had collapsed amid concerns about [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=35.56s)]
*  wild spending and, quote, sexually inappropriate behavior in the workplace. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=41.76s)]
*  The group's donors soon folded the organization into a different veterans group, basically, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  according to Mayer's reporting, in order to get Hegseth's hands off the checkbook. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=52.72s)]
*  So, that was Veterans for Freedom. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=57.72s)]
*  Then it was Concerned Veterans for America, where Hegseth was in charge from 2013 to 2016 [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=60.04s)]
*  before he was forced out of that organization, too. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=66.0s)]
*  From Mayer's reporting, quote, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=71.16s)]
*  while acting in his official capacity, to the point of needing to be carried out of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=82.72s)]
*  the organization's events. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=86.88s)]
*  The detailed report, which was compiled by multiple former employees and sent to the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=89.12s)]
*  organization's senior management, states that at one point, Hegseth had to be restrained [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=94.28s)]
*  while drunk from joining the dancers on the stage of a Louisiana strip club, where he [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=99.0s)]
*  had brought his team from the organization. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  The report also says that Hegseth, who was married at the time, and other members of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=107.32s)]
*  his management team, sexually pursued the organization's female staffers, whom they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=111.52s)]
*  divided into two groups, the, quote, party girls and the, quote, not party girls. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=116.52s)]
*  In a separate letter of complaint, which was sent to the organization, a different former [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=122.52s)]
*  employee described Hegseth being at a bar in the early morning hours of May 29, 2015, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  while on an official tour through Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=131.88s)]
*  He was drunkenly chanting at the bar, quote, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=135.66s)]
*  Mayor says, quote, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=142.4s)]
*  I spoke at length with two people who identified themselves as having contributed to the whistleblower [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=143.12s)]
*  report. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=147.52s)]
*  One of them said of Hegseth, quote, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=148.52s)]
*  I've seen him drunk so many times. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  I've seen him dragged away not a few times, but multiple times. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=152.28s)]
*  To have him at the Pentagon would be scary. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  Adding, quote, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=158.96s)]
*  When those of us who worked at Concern Veterans for America heard he was being considered [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  for Secretary of Defense, it wasn't no, it was hell no. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=164.52s)]
*  According to the complaint, at one such CVA event in Virginia Beach on Memorial Day weekend [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=170.56s)]
*  in 2014, Hegseth was, quote, totally sloshed and needed to be carried to his room because [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=175.04s)]
*  he was, quote, so intoxicated. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=180.76s)]
*  The following month, during an event in Cleveland, Hegseth, who had gone with his team to a bar [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  around the corner from their hotel, was described as, quote, completely drunk in a public place. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=187.6s)]
*  According to the report, quote, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=193.2s)]
*  that the report does not identify them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=201.44s)]
*  Nevertheless, in October 2014, the group instituted a no alcohol policy at its events. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=203.6s)]
*  The following month, however, Hegseth and another manager lifted the policy, lifted [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  the no alcohol policy, while overseeing a get out the vote field operation to boost [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=215.44s)]
*  Republican candidates in North Carolina. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  According to the report on the evening before the election, Hegseth, who had been out with [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  three young female staff members, was so inebriated by 1 a.m. that a staffer who'd driven him to his [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  hotel in a van full of other drunken staffers asked for assistance to get Hegseth to his room. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  Quote, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  the report says. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  took two male staff members to get Hegseth into the hotel. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=244.64s)]
*  After one young woman vomited in some bushes, another helped him to bed. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=248.16s)]
*  In the morning, a team member had to wake Hegseth so he didn't miss his flight. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=253.27999999999997s)]
*  According to the report, quote, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=257.2s)]
*  all of this happened in public while Concerned Veterans for America was, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=258.64s)]
*  quote, embedded in the Republican get out the vote effort. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=262.56s)]
*  The following month, in December 2014, the group held an office Christmas party [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=266.64s)]
*  at the Grand Hyatt in Washington. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=270.4s)]
*  Once again, according to the report, Hegseth was noticeably intoxicated and had to be carried up [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=272.24s)]
*  to his room. The report stated, quote, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=278.08s)]
*  his behavior was embarrassing in front of the team, but not surprising. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  People have simply come to expect Pete to get drunk at social events. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=283.92s)]
*  The 2015 federal tax filing by Concerned Veterans for America has an unusual note, saying, quote, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=288.08s)]
*  major problems developed in the last fiscal year were paused. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=294.08s)]
*  Filing also describes Pete Hegseth as, quote, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  president outgoing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=301.6s)]
*  By the start of 2016, Hegseth was out of his job. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=304.88000000000005s)]
*  I should tell you, NBC News has not independently confirmed the reporting in The New Yorker. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=310.32000000000005s)]
*  Pete Hegseth would not comment for the piece, though someone described as an advisor to him [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  told the magazine that the claims were, quote, outlandish. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=319.04s)]
*  Joining us now is Jane Mayer, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  chief Washington correspondent at The New Yorker magazine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=324.56s)]
*  Ms. Mayer, it's really nice to see you. Thank you for making time to be here tonight. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=327.44s)]
*  So glad to be with you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=332.4s)]
*  Did I get any of that the wrong way around, or is there anything else from your reporting [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=335.12s)]
*  that you want to highlight for our audience to understand in terms of what you learned about [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=339.28s)]
*  Mr. Hegseth? Well, thanks so much. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=342.88s)]
*  Thanks. You did a great summary. And the one thing I would say that is also clear from this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=348.0s)]
*  report is that we gave a spokesman, a lawyer for Pete Hegseth today is basically to respond, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=356.72s)]
*  and they have not denied a single thing in this report. So they just said no comment [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  after being given sort of very careful questions. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=371.52000000000004s)]
*  The other thing I'd like to say is just that it's been almost a day since this story came out, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=376.16s)]
*  and my phone has been ringing off the hook. I have been hearing from many more people who [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=380.8s)]
*  worked with Pete Hegseth who have come out of the woodwork to say they too have stories along the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=387.2s)]
*  same lines, stories of just drinking himself into sort of oblivion, all of which I think is, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  you know, I mean, I've got nothing against people having a good time in life, but it's when you [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=401.04s)]
*  combine it with running the Defense Department that it really does get to be an alarming picture. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=408.08s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about the first veterans group, chronologically the first veterans group [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=416.08s)]
*  that Hegseth was involved with, this group Veterans for Freedom. You say under his leadership, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  Veterans for Freedom soon ran up enormous debt and financial records indicate that by the end of 2008, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  the year after he became the leader of the group, it was unable to pay its creditors. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=433.76s)]
*  The group's primary donors became concerned their money was being wasted on inappropriate expenses. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=437.44s)]
*  There were rumors of parties that, quote, could politely be called [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=442.4s)]
*  trists. A former associate of the group put it, one early Hegseth sympathizer said, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=446.4s)]
*  I wasn't the first to hear there was money sloshing around and sexually inappropriate [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=452.32s)]
*  behavior in the workplace. Can I, I don't mean to be like dense here, but can you explain or [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=456.48s)]
*  just put in sort of different terms what exactly that allegation means about the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=462.72s)]
*  sort of combination of a fiscal problem at the organization, a financial problem [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  at the organization under his leadership, but also something about what was going on [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=474.0s)]
*  in the workplace and with these parties? Well, I mean, it's no secret to anyone who knows [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=477.92s)]
*  Pete Hegseth that he's had gone through at least two marriages and there are many, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=485.04s)]
*  many, many allegations of infidelity, which are the reason that his marriages ended and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=492.96s)]
*  that there's been a long pattern here that we've seen of sexually inappropriate behavior by him [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=498.24s)]
*  in the workplace and overspending as well. And so that's, that is what people saw even in the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=505.2s)]
*  beginning, but way back. That was back 2007. And as you said, by 2008, I mean, that, that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=514.96s)]
*  organization was on the brink of bankruptcy. And it was, the thing is, if you think about it as a, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=522.08s)]
*  a test of whether this person might be a manager of the largest federal department in America, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=528.16s)]
*  it was an organization that had between five and 10 employees and a budget of between five and 10 [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=536.0s)]
*  million dollars. I mean, it is, it's miniscule really. There's, there's just no history that he [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=541.5200000000001s)]
*  has that shows that he's capable of managing a large organization. Senator Richard Blumenthal [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  told you, much as we might be sympathetic to people with continuing alcohol problems, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=557.44s)]
*  they shouldn't be at the top of our national security structure. It's dangerous. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=562.16s)]
*  The secretary of defense is involved in every issue of national security. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=565.76s)]
*  He's involved in the use of nuclear weapons and trusting these kinds of issues to someone who [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=569.6s)]
*  might be incapacitated for any reason is a risk we cannot take. Did Jane last question for you, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=574.8s)]
*  as you were in reporting this and trying to get comment from Hegseth, did you come across any [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=579.8399999999999s)]
*  indication that the Trump transition or that former president Trump himself was aware of these [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-ougeByaMw&t=585.68s)]
