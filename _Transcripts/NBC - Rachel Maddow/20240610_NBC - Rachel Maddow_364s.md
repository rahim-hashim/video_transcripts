# Harbinger for 2024? Shocking European elections eyed for U.S. election foreshadowing
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8)
*  We are going through some weird stuff right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=0.0s)]
*  But we have gone through weird stuff before. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=4.72s)]
*  And I do think that we can learn from it and that we urgently need to. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=8.32s)]
*  That's why I've been working on all these projects. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  That's why I've got this new podcast out. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=16.56s)]
*  And I hope you listen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=18.48s)]
*  But it's not just the distant past and the very recent past. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=21.28s)]
*  When we got Donald Trump in the White House in the first place, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=24.48s)]
*  you might remember what preceded that shock election result here in the United States in 2016. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=27.44s)]
*  Our shock presidential election result in 2016 was preceded that year by some shocking and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=33.84s)]
*  surprisingly right-wing election results in Europe, including the Brexit vote in Britain, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  which happened just months before Trump's surprise presidential victory here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=46.8s)]
*  I asked Ben Rhodes to please join us here tonight in the wake of what is now, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=52.0s)]
*  another round of what seemed to be surprisingly right-wing election results in Europe this weekend. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  Was it right in 2016 to see right-wing election results in Europe [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=62.8s)]
*  as a harbinger of what was coming for us in the fall of 2016? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=67.6s)]
*  As President Biden balances his campaign responsibilities right now with back-to-back [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  trips to Europe, he just got back from Europe. He heads back to Europe again on Wednesday. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=77.36s)]
*  Do the election results from Europe right now this weekend [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=82.8s)]
*  have hallmarks that tell us anything about what to expect here and about how weird this is all [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=86.32s)]
*  going to get? President Biden clearly sees our connections to Europe right now as absolutely [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=91.52s)]
*  key to the future of the world. Does what's going on in European politics right now tell [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=96.96s)]
*  us anything to expect about the future of our world here? Joining us now is Ben Rhodes. He's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=103.36s)]
*  former deputy national security adviser to President Obama. He's co-host of the Pod Save [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=108.8s)]
*  the World podcast. Ben, it's really great to see you. Thanks for making time to be here tonight. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Good to see you. First, let me just ask you, for some of our viewers who may not have paid [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=118.16s)]
*  close attention to what was happening in the European elections this weekend, let me ask you [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=125.44s)]
*  two questions about them. Do you think they are important for us to pay attention to? And can [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=129.84s)]
*  you just give us a rough characterization of what happened in those elections? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  Sure. These were elections for the European Parliament, so the European Union-wide Parliament. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=139.44s)]
*  And so it's the only election that takes place every few years in which all of Europe votes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  So it's a good barometer of where opinion is in Europe. I think the two headlines are, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=148.4s)]
*  the far-right made noticeable gains in the two largest countries in Europe, France and Germany. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  In France, the National Front Party, which is the far-right party that used to be on the fringes [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  of French politics, emerged as by far the largest vote getter in this election. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  And to just build on what you're saying, Rachel, this is a party that is not only far right, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=168.96s)]
*  they've had ties to Russia. They got a $10 million loan from Russia within the last decade. So this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=172.88s)]
*  is not conjecture. This is reality. And in Germany, the AfD party, which has ties that go back into [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  the kind of neo-Nazi past of Germany, that's never a good thing in German politics, obviously, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=184.72s)]
*  they got over 15 percent of the vote. Not a huge total, but very alarming given the source here. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=188.64s)]
*  Now, I want to be clear. In other parts of Europe, actually, the center did hold. But I think the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=193.92s)]
*  real concerning factor is in the two most important countries, France and Germany, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=198.88s)]
*  we saw these far-right gains. Do you think that it's right to look back at 2016 and see some of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  what was going on in politics in Europe as a harbinger for the shock election result we got [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  in the fall of 2016 when Trump won? Do you think that these election results should be read [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  as a harbinger of what's coming down the pike for us this year? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=220.48s)]
*  I absolutely do, Rachel. The commonality between the Brexit vote, the vote by the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=224.55999999999997s)]
*  U.K. to lead the European Union in 2016 in the Trump election, was that it was a lot of — it [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=228.32s)]
*  was a surprise. People did not think that Brexit was going to win that campaign. And they campaigned [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  on a kind of right-wing populist message. The slogan was take back control. And they ran against [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  globalists and liberal elites and against immigration and was very Trumpy in its message, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=243.83999999999997s)]
*  frankly. And it kind of foreshadowed what we ended up dealing with in the fall here. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=248.72s)]
*  I think, Rachel, the warning in this election — and you asked me a question when I came on [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=253.44s)]
*  to talk about my book a few years ago about far-right parties and their commonalities [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=257.84s)]
*  around the world. You asked me, well, what lessons should we learn? I always think about that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=262.0s)]
*  The lesson I take from this one, Rachel, is that there are incumbent parties in Germany and France [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=266.48s)]
*  that have defended essentially the status quo. Emmanuel Macron has been a defender of the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=272.24s)]
*  European Union. Olaf Scholz in Germany has been a defender of what we would call the liberal [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=276.48s)]
*  international order. People are not listening to that message right now. You cannot defeat these [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=280.8s)]
*  parties, these populist insurgents, by beating the defenders of the status quo. That's hard for Joe [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=286.48s)]
*  Biden, who's president of the United States. But you have to simultaneously tap into people's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=292.0s)]
*  dissatisfaction with globalization, dissatisfaction with inequality, sense that things are slipping [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=296.56s)]
*  out of control. It's not enough to just say, we're the responsible adults here. You have to kind of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=302.24s)]
*  get down and have a different message for how things are going to change. And I think that that's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=306.8s)]
*  the warning sign that Joe Biden should hear. Not enough to run on status quo here, not enough to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  defend even the things that we think are very important. You have to meet people where they [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=316.08s)]
*  are, and people are frustrated. Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security advisor to President [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=319.92s)]
*  Obama. Ben, thank you for making the time. I feel like when we need to like widen the lens a lot and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=325.76s)]
*  look at America in the world, you're almost always one of the first people I think of to talk to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=333.36s)]
*  about these things. Thank you so much for being here. Thanks, Rachel. I can't wait to check out [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=337.12s)]
*  the podcast, too. It sounds great. I appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtu1o5qFf8&t=340.96000000000004s)]
