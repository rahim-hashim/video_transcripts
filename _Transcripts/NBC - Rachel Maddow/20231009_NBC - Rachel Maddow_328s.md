# ‘Hamas needs to be eliminated’: Rep. Goldman calls neutralization an ‘initial mission’
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs)
*  You and Senator Booker, as I mentioned, were both able to quickly and safely get out of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=0.0s)]
*  the country. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=5.68s)]
*  What do you understand about the situation in terms of Americans who may be seeking consular [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=6.96s)]
*  help and other people who are trying to leave? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=11.5s)]
*  Obviously, we just spoke with the deputy national security adviser, Mr. Feiner, about the difficulties [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=14.36s)]
*  that people in Gaza have trying to get anywhere. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=20.44s)]
*  2.3 million people packed into a narrow 25-mile-long strip of land, very, very densely packed area [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=24.88s)]
*  with no real way to leave ahead of what's now already started as the Israeli retaliation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=32.239999999999995s)]
*  Similarly, lots of Israelis want to get out of the country under very different circumstances, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=38.08s)]
*  Americans among them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=43.56s)]
*  What do you understand about freedom of movement, freedom of travel, and what the U.S. government [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=44.64s)]
*  is able to do to support that? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=48.0s)]
*  Well, we're in regular communication with both the State Department and the administration, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=50.88s)]
*  as well as I have numerous constituents, many who went over like I did for the Sukkot holiday [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  in Israel, which is a very common time for Jews to return to Israel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  So we are very concerned. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=69.76s)]
*  Right now, there are very few flights going in and out. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=71.16s)]
*  It appears as if El Al Airlines, the Israeli national airlines, is just about the only [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=73.36s)]
*  one that is coming in and out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=77.12s)]
*  And we are having regular communications with the State Department because so many Americans [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  do want to get out. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=84.36s)]
*  They should reach out to the State Department or their local member of Congress. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  You know, on the Gaza front, and I heard what Mr. Feiner said, I would add one thing that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=90.12s)]
*  I think is really important here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=96.68s)]
*  And I just saw a video from the IDF that was translated in Arabic that explained to civilian [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=98.56s)]
*  Gazans that there are designated evacuee places for them to go to avoid being in buildings [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=105.42s)]
*  where Hamas has its infrastructure, which are the targets of Israel's retaliation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=114.9s)]
*  That is, of course, a courtesy that the 260 concertgoers and the children and grandparents [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=125.1s)]
*  in southern Israel did not get from the Hamas terrorists. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=133.24s)]
*  And I think it's a very important distinction to make here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=136.96s)]
*  Israel is notifying civilians in Gaza when they are going to attack their particular [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=139.84s)]
*  areas. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=146.0s)]
*  And that is in accordance with international law, unlike what the Hamas terrorists did [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  on Saturday. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=151.68s)]
*  Israel has had so many conflicts in its 75-year history, you know, all the way back to 1948 [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=155.24s)]
*  as recently as a couple of years ago, an 11-day war in Gaza. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=160.56s)]
*  And I feel like oftentimes looking at historical analogues, historical precedents can help [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=164.4s)]
*  us understand what might happen in this circumstance. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=170.8s)]
*  In this circumstance, as you're describing the specific situation in which we've got [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  not only these mass-coordinated terrorist attacks inside Israel, but the mass hostage-taking, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=179.88s)]
*  to me, makes it—I don't—I feel like no precedent helps me understand what happens [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=186.2s)]
*  next. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  And I don't understand what the end game is strategically for choosing to take so many [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=192.83999999999997s)]
*  people, young kids, babies, the elderly, disabled people, whole families taking them hostage. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't see how it resolves. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  I feel like it makes everything here not just more horrific, but also more unpredictable [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=207.88s)]
*  in terms of how this can sort out, because nothing like this has happened before. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=214.35999999999999s)]
*  I wanted to ask if you just had a—if you had a take on that or any different kind of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=218.11999999999998s)]
*  understanding of that than I feel. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, you're absolutely right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  This is unprecedented in Israel's history. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=226.76s)]
*  And this is not just a perpetuation of the cycle of violence that we've become—some, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  unfortunately, many have become somewhat numb to over the last several decades. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=234.04s)]
*  This was a coordinated, premeditated terrorist attack against civilians in Israel that has [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=238.76s)]
*  not occurred in the history, 75-year history of Israel. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=244.2s)]
*  What we are seeing and the reason why we as Americans must stand with Israel against the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=249.64s)]
*  terrorist organization Hamas is a scenario where Hamas has control of the Gaza Strip, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=255.92s)]
*  but Hamas is a terrorist organization. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=262.92s)]
*  This is not about Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=265.4s)]
*  This is about a terrorist organization that has exacted horrific war crimes against Israel [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=267.48s)]
*  because their sole mission is to eradicate Israel from the face of the earth. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=275.24s)]
*  And the only way to deal with a terrorist organization like Hamas is how the world dealt [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=279.88s)]
*  with terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda and ISIS, because that is exactly what Hamas [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=284.6s)]
*  is. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=289.88s)]
*  Hamas needs to be eliminated from Gaza. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=290.88s)]
*  There needs to be a new government that can represent the interest of the Palestinian [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=293.64s)]
*  people, which Hamas does not do. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=297.64s)]
*  And so the initial mission must be to eliminate and neutralize Hamas. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq4DXTiXEQs&t=300.44s)]
