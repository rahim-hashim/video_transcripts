# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: July 10
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI)
*  In terms of our politics here at home, things are getting a little punchy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=0.0s)]
*  a little punchier than it ever should be, frankly. And we probably should have known to expect it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  This is tape you might remember seeing from a few, a couple of months ago. This was an incident in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=10.08s)]
*  Michigan in April at a meeting of the Michigan Republican Party. A couple of county-level [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=15.6s)]
*  Republican Party officials in the state getting into kind of a slapping, shoving fight. Again, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=23.44s)]
*  that was April of this year. Then this weekend, the same Republican Party, the Michigan Republican [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=28.4s)]
*  Party, went back to this same hotel in Clare, Michigan for another statewide Republican Party [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=34.56s)]
*  meeting. And apparently there was yet another punch-up. Craig Mauger at the Detroit News was [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=40.16s)]
*  first to report on what happened in Michigan this weekend. It's one of those reports that I [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=46.4s)]
*  can't really improve upon, so I'm just going to tell you, give it to you as Mr. Mauger reported [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=50.56s)]
*  it in the Detroit paper. A Republican man from Wayne County, Michigan, quote, acknowledged that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=55.36s)]
*  he wiggled the knob of one door leading into the meeting room while the meeting was underway. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=61.76s)]
*  The chairman of the Clare County Republican Party heard the wiggling of the doorknob and walked over [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=68.0s)]
*  to the door where he says he saw someone through a small window in the door flip him off. Quote, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=74.48s)]
*  the Clare County Republican Party chairman then opened the door and says, quote, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=82.72s)]
*  he kicked me in the balls as soon as I opened the door. The scuffle intensified. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=87.84s)]
*  And long story short, the Clare County Republican Party chairman provided this account to the Detroit [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=94.64s)]
*  News in a phone interview from an emergency room in Clare, Michigan, an emergency room in which [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=99.2s)]
*  he says he was being treated for what was believed to be a broken rib. The man who did the alleged [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  flipping off and then the alleged ball kicking of the other Republican official, he told the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=112.32s)]
*  Detroit News that he took off his glasses before engaging in these fisticuffs, telling the Detroit [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=117.44s)]
*  News, quote, when you see me taking my glasses off, I'm ready to rock. Again, statewide Republican [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=124.0s)]
*  Party meeting in Michigan this weekend. The news outlet Bridge Michigan has a little bit more [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=132.88s)]
*  after the Detroit News was first to report on what happened. Bridge notes that charges are [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=139.84s)]
*  likely going to be pressed in this case. They also note that the man who did the alleged [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=144.96s)]
*  flipping off and the alleged ball kicking also has his own version of the story in which he says that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=149.28s)]
*  he was not the aggressor. He says the other guy threatened him and that the other guy, quote, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=154.96s)]
*  came out of the meeting with his dukes up. To say the least, this is not how anything in politics [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=161.6s)]
*  is supposed to go. But this is how it's going in Michigan Republican politics. Two consecutive [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=169.6s)]
*  statewide Michigan Republican Party meetings, both at the same hotel in Claire, Michigan, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  both of which resulted in physical fights among Republicans who were there for the meeting. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=182.4s)]
*  I should note that, I mean, I was going to say it's understandable. Tensions are high. It's not [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=189.12s)]
*  understandable. No matter how high tensions are, you don't need to kick anybody in the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=195.28s)]
*  hoozy watsy at a political meeting for any reason. So there's no excuse for it. But Michigan [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=201.04s)]
*  Republicans, you should know, are doing poorly right now in lots of different ways. This is one [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=207.04s)]
*  of the state parties that was just convulsed by former Republican President Donald Trump [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=212.72s)]
*  demanding that Michigan Republicans should find a way to overthrow the election results in that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=217.76s)]
*  state and declare him the winner in 2020, even though he lost in Michigan. The implications of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=223.36s)]
*  that, the repercussions of that have been strange and are ongoing. The state does now have an election [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  denier as its state chairwoman. Michigan Republican Party chairwoman says that the, you know, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump's election claims should have resulted in Michigan throwing out the vote results and [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=241.44000000000003s)]
*  instead declaring him the winner. She also refused to acknowledge her own massive double-digit loss [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=246.8s)]
*  in a statewide race when she ran for secretary of state recently. In addition to her being the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=252.56s)]
*  state party chair, for the first time in four decades, Michigan Republicans hold no statewide [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=257.68s)]
*  offices and neither house of the legislature. They've never been as far out of power as they [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=262.72s)]
*  are now, at least not in the last 40 years. That said, Michigan Republicans are apparently still [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=268.4s)]
*  capable of breaking each other's ribs at meetings. So they've got that. You might have seen over the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=275.04s)]
*  weekend that there was a weekend ruling from a federal appeals court in Tennessee. Tennessee [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=282.32s)]
*  Republicans have been going after trans people every way they can. A federal appeals court this [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=287.76s)]
*  weekend on Saturday in a divided two-to-one decision let that state go forward with banning [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=292.96s)]
*  specific kinds of health care for trans people. And this is not some, you know, some distant threat [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=300.0s)]
*  or something that's kind of locked up in the courts now. Thanks to that appeals court ruling, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=305.76s)]
*  again on Saturday this weekend, for people under the age of 18, that ruling this weekend means [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=310.56s)]
*  whatever ongoing health care they have been getting in Tennessee, it is now officially illegal. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=315.68s)]
*  That ruling went into effect immediately. Any such health care, ongoing health care that you've [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=320.72s)]
*  previously been receiving, has to stop immediately. But that's also happening in the context of this [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=325.68s)]
*  other thing that Republicans are doing in the state of Tennessee that I do think puts them sort [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=333.76s)]
*  of at the front of the line right now. The Republican state attorney general in Tennessee [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=338.32s)]
*  is using his office to obtain the private medical records, unredacted full medical records, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=343.36s)]
*  for patients who have had care at a particular clinic in Tennessee at the Vanderbilt University [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=350.32s)]
*  Medical Center. He's using his office as attorney general to take people's individual private [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=355.76s)]
*  unredacted medical records for the purposes of an investigation in his state attorney's office, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=363.12s)]
*  state attorney general's office. Now, Vanderbilt University Medical Center says that they had no [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=368.48s)]
*  choice but to hand over these records after the attorney general demanded them, but they also [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=373.76s)]
*  didn't notify their patients that they had handed over their records until after they had already [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=378.64s)]
*  started handing them in. In other words, Vanderbilt presumably could have told their patients, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  we've received this demand from the attorney general's office, we don't want to comply, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=388.64s)]
*  but we think we're going to have to, we want to let you know before we give them your records. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=392.48s)]
*  That's not the way it went, apparently. Vanderbilt University Medical Center reportedly started [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=398.8s)]
*  handing over the records in response to the attorney general's demands months ago, and just [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=403.68s)]
*  recently let their patients know that those records have been given. So according to reporting in the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=410.8s)]
*  Tennessean newspaper, the attorney general has taken people's medical records. He's also taken [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=417.12s)]
*  information on people who volunteer at this particular clinic. He's also taken information [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=423.44s)]
*  on anyone who has written in with a question about LGBTQ health care using a website that was set up [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=428.16s)]
*  to field queries on that topic. He's even taken the names of people who were referred to that clinic [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=435.36s)]
*  at Vanderbilt, even if those people never actually got care there. The attorney general's office has [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=443.76s)]
*  collected all this information, apparently demanded all these records going back to 2018, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=449.68s)]
*  and now they've got them. Now, years ago, we covered a similar case, at least a case with [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=455.52s)]
*  echoes of this, in Kansas. You might remember this story. A Republican attorney general there [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=463.68s)]
*  named Phil Klein used the power of his office to get individual medical records of women who had [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=468.24s)]
*  been to an abortion clinic in the state of Kansas. He and his staff took women's medical records, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=474.56s)]
*  private medical records, unredacted medical records, took them, used the power of their office to get [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=480.08s)]
*  them from the clinic, then copied them, kept them in totally insecure containers and car trunks in [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=485.12s)]
*  people's garages, trucked them around the state, reportedly left some of them at a Kinko's copy shop [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=492.88s)]
*  at one point. These are personal, individual, private medical records dealing with the most [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=497.44s)]
*  sensitive possible medical information. The attorney general who did that in Kansas was [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  an anti-abortion activist who Republicans elected to be their state attorney general. His name was [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=509.12s)]
*  Phil Klein. He ended up having his law license permanently suspended for doing that about 10 [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=513.76s)]
*  years ago. But now here's the Tennessee Republican attorney general using a page out of the same [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=519.04s)]
*  playbook now, demanding and getting unredacted complete private medical records for trans people [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=525.76s)]
*  in Tennessee as Republicans use every tool they've got to try to make life miserable for [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=534.8s)]
*  trans people and their families in that state. Attorney Chase Strangio is the deputy director [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=540.72s)]
*  for transgender justice at the ACLU nationwide. The ACLU is suing the state of Tennessee over [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=547.4399999999999s)]
*  the ban on care for trans youth in that state. Chase Strangio tells us tonight, quote, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=553.76s)]
*  when you have this type of aggressive investigation from an attorney general combined with legislation, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=559.04s)]
*  not only does it limit the care that's available, it also chills the provision of care more [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=564.24s)]
*  generally. Doctors are less inclined to provide it. Hospitals are less inclined to teach it. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=568.08s)]
*  Families, if there's a threat of violence or my kids' records could be exposed, I'm out of there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=572.72s)]
*  You have this dynamic in which care is not only being banned, it's also being chilled [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=577.84s)]
*  prospectively. And that will have an effect for generations. Margaret Rinkle is a journalist who [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=582.88s)]
*  lives in Nashville. She wrote this about this situation in Tennessee for the New York Times. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=591.2s)]
*  She says, quote, tell me this isn't a witch hunt. Tell me this isn't an open campaign of terror [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  against already vulnerable citizens who had every reason to believe that their medical records, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=602.24s)]
*  their medical records were confidential and every reason to believe that the medical clinic [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=607.28s)]
*  of a major university hospital was a safe space. Joining us now is Ali Chapman. She leads a local [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=612.72s)]
*  chapter of the Tennessee Equality Project. She's got a master's degree in science and another in [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=620.88s)]
*  public health. She's also the mom of a transgender son who received care at Vanderbilt, which is the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=624.48s)]
*  medical center that's just been forced to hand over patient medical records to the state's [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=630.64s)]
*  Republican attorney general. Ms. Chapman, I really want to thank you for joining us tonight. It [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=634.8s)]
*  should not take bravery to speak out publicly on an issue like this, but I know particularly in [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=639.3599999999999s)]
*  your state right now it does. And so I'm really grateful that you're here. Thanks. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=644.0799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. First, let me just ask you if I got any of that wrong or if there's anything that I, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  anything important that I'm missing about what's going on with this sort of twin nightmare in [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=655.04s)]
*  Tennessee right now with the legislation that's affecting trans people and their families and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=660.56s)]
*  also the situation with private medical records being taken by the state attorney general. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=665.8399999999999s)]
*  It's really complicated and just infuriating because it doesn't need to be this complicated. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=672.0799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't need to be invasive. And, you know, the issue that we have is they've not only violated [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  the trust of patients and doctors as an institution, but Vanderbilt has demonstrated [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=686.0s)]
*  their willingness to share records when they've been compelled by the state for what I would say [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  would be any reason. So I think this is telling for people who would also be concerned about [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=698.8s)]
*  reproductive rights, just healthcare in general. And while we were waiting and hoping on the courts [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=702.64s)]
*  to be reasonable and make common sense rules, rulings, we know common sense is only common [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=710.0s)]
*  for those who have experienced the same things. And the reality is most of the people in the [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=718.72s)]
*  state of Tennessee have not interacted with or know trans kids or their families. So there's a [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=722.56s)]
*  lot of misinformation that's showing up, that shows up in the rulings and the way that they're [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=729.2s)]
*  being written by the judges. It shows up in the debates. It shows up in the arguments and the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=733.44s)]
*  conversations and the hate speech that's happening through bad actors like Matt Walsh and Ben Shapiro. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=738.96s)]
*  Well, on that point about common understanding and common sense, and I would add maybe common [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=748.48s)]
*  decency, I feel like as trans people and their families have been attacked and have been demonized [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=755.6800000000001s)]
*  and as people, as you mentioned, people in conservative media, conservative social media, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  have really decided that this is a meal ticket for them to attack this particular population [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=767.76s)]
*  in increasingly intense ways. I feel like there's a lot of differences of opinions. There's a lot [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=773.12s)]
*  of heat on this issue. But one thing I feel like where people don't have to imagine a different [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=780.48s)]
*  kind of life, they don't need to put themselves in somebody else's shoes, they can just think [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=785.68s)]
*  about this through their own experience, is private medical records being taken by law enforcement. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=788.72s)]
*  And in particular in this case with the medical center saying it was compelled, it had no choice [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=793.92s)]
*  but to hand them over, but not letting patients know until after they had already handed them over. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=799.12s)]
*  I have to imagine, at least I have to hope, that there's some empathetic reaction among other [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=803.6800000000001s)]
*  Tennesseans that private medical records should at least stay private, that that part of this [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=809.2s)]
*  has to feel over the line to people who maybe otherwise don't see themselves as allies on this [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=814.64s)]
*  issue. Even among our allies, there's still a lot of confusion and misunderstanding, and you [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=819.36s)]
*  did, you nailed it. We really need to be talking about common decency, fineness and empathy, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=829.12s)]
*  and that's not what we're seeing. And so we're fighting both, we're fighting an argument when [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=835.28s)]
*  it comes to science and biology, which most people don't understand from a third grade level, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=840.4s)]
*  or are we talking about collectively the personhood of someone? And that's what I really [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=845.28s)]
*  like to focus on when I'm talking about children specifically is these are human beings with lives. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=850.4s)]
*  That's who I'm focused on. And when I try to engage in conversations with people who still [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=856.16s)]
*  at this point don't understand, I think that's really challenging because it takes up a lot of [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=862.24s)]
*  energy and time and distracts people from what we're trying to do, which is to protect people [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=868.4s)]
*  trans kids. We do not want the state and we do not want the attorney general's committee and we don't [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=875.28s)]
*  want the governor in their positions of power to abuse in a way that threatens these kids because [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=880.8s)]
*  that's the reality of it. And something I try to explain to people, in my case and knowing other [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=888.16s)]
*  supportive parents, you're faced with a choice. If you support your child, you're looking at [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=894.0s)]
*  hopefully a brighter future for them and discovering what that means along the way. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=900.96s)]
*  If you choose not to accept them, if you choose to push them to the margins and allow people to [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=905.36s)]
*  push them to the margins and you give in, you're faced with two results. One is you never see your [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=912.08s)]
*  children again. The second is they die. And people like to say that this is a hyperbolic statement. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=918.64s)]
*  It is not. I know children who have died of suicide in the last few years. And the political [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=924.24s)]
*  rhetoric and just, you know, the conversation is so harmful. It is so very, very harmful. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=930.32s)]
*  And we need the backing of our leaders and people in positions of power. And we just do not have that. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=936.6400000000001s)]
*  Need the backing of leadership. You also need allies among other people in your state, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=944.32s)]
*  whether or not they see themselves as as directly affected. Now, I don't think we know why Vladimir [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=948.4000000000001s)]
*  Putin really decided to invade Ukraine. Who knows what lurks in his hard little heart. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=955.52s)]
*  But we do know that lots of people who are sympathetic to Putin or who are at least inclined [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=962.8s)]
*  to apologize for or explain away the worst of what Putin does, a lot of those people had a [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=968.4s)]
*  favorite supposed explanation for why Putin felt the need to start that war. A lot of Putin [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=974.72s)]
*  apologists and Putin sympathizers said that Putin felt like he had to invade Ukraine [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=982.56s)]
*  because he felt very shy about NATO. The NATO alliance just had too many countries in it, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=990.4799999999999s)]
*  too many countries that were too close to Russia. And that all just gave Putin this terrible cooties [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=998.2399999999999s)]
*  feeling about NATO being too close. And so therefore he had to invade Ukraine. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1004.0799999999999s)]
*  Again, I don't actually think that's it. I don't think we know all the reasons why he does what he [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1009.84s)]
*  does. Who knows what's going on in his little short dictator heart of hearts. But if in fact [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1016.32s)]
*  the apologists are at least partially correct, if in fact Putin was hoping that one of the effects [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1023.68s)]
*  of him invading Ukraine would be a brush back to NATO, that he would be able to worry less about [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1030.88s)]
*  NATO and somehow starting this war would make that happen. Sorry. When Putin invaded Ukraine, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1036.24s)]
*  there were 30 countries in NATO. Now there are about to be 32. Finland was the 31st country to [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1042.8s)]
*  join in April. That gave Russia 800 more miles of border directly with a NATO country. And now as of [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1050.0s)]
*  tonight, we know that Sweden is going to join NATO as well. Sweden said months ago that they wanted [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1056.96s)]
*  to join, but this is something that really until today it looked like it couldn't happen. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1064.16s)]
*  And that's because for a new country to join NATO, it has to be a unanimous decision. All the other [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1070.16s)]
*  countries in the NATO alliance have to agree with the decision. If one country says no to it, it [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1075.76s)]
*  doesn't happen. And in the case of Sweden, it was an original NATO, it was a NATO member, a single [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1080.88s)]
*  NATO country, Turkey, that said no. They said Finland was okay with them, but they were not [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1088.96s)]
*  okay with Sweden joining. As recently as this weekend, Turkey's president was still saying, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1094.5600000000002s)]
*  no, Turkey would not assent to this. Turkey would not allow Sweden to join. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1099.6000000000001s)]
*  But the Biden administration, President Biden himself, kept expressing confidence that Turkey [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1105.2s)]
*  was going to change its mind on this, that they would allow Sweden to join. And nobody quite knew [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1110.0800000000002s)]
*  why President Biden seemed so confident that it would happen. He just kept saying it would be [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1115.2s)]
*  fine, that he was sure it would get done, that he and his team were working on it. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1120.72s)]
*  Well, now apparently, as of tonight, they got it done. President Biden had one-on-one discussions [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  with Turkey's president yesterday. President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1131.28s)]
*  was apparently working with both Turkey and Sweden all day yesterday. And today, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1136.48s)]
*  Secretary of State Tony Blinken reportedly met with the Turkish foreign minister, so his Turkish [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1141.52s)]
*  counterpart, three times over the last five days, including today. So it apparently took a real [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1145.8400000000001s)]
*  full court press at the very top levels of the Biden administration. But as of tonight, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1151.76s)]
*  they got it done. Turkey has relented. Turkey now agrees. The president has said Sweden joining [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1155.92s)]
*  NATO is fine with him. The Turkish parliament does still have to sign off, but they will. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1162.48s)]
*  And then Sweden will become NATO country number 32, which is a huge win for President Biden and [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1167.44s)]
*  the Biden administration. This is definitely one of those, you know, they said it couldn't be done [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1175.52s)]
*  situations. It has been done. It's going to happen. That is a huge win for Biden. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1181.04s)]
*  It also has to be said it is a humiliating kick in the tiny little dictatorial pants [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1186.24s)]
*  of Russian President Vladimir Putin. I mean, if you started this war in Ukraine because you were [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1190.64s)]
*  so upset at the size of NATO, well, how's that big strategic thinking working out for you now? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKfc3AmJ3rI&t=1195.36s)]
