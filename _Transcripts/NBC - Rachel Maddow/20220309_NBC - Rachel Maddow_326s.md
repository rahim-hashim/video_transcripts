# Ukrainians Will Make A Russian Occupation Unsustainable: Yovanovitch
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E)
*  Joining me now is the former United States Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=0.0s)]
*  Her new book, Lessons from the Edge, comes out next week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=4.44s)]
*  You know a lot of people in Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=8.08s)]
*  What are you hearing from them? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=10.48s)]
*  What are they telling you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=11.48s)]
*  Well, it's across the board. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=13.48s)]
*  I mean, it's disbelief, it's anguish, it's, you know, cries for help. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=16.04s)]
*  But I'm also hearing the resolute nature of the Ukrainian people, what you are seeing, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=20.6s)]
*  and online every day. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=27.36s)]
*  The Ukrainian people do not give up. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=31.4s)]
*  I've been in touch with somebody in the Ukrainian government who's quite high up, and he's working [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=33.32s)]
*  seven floors down in a bunker. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=38.92s)]
*  He says there's no light, there's no air, there are only government people and security [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=42.04s)]
*  people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=47.4s)]
*  And he talks about the difference between life down there and life on the surface. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=48.64s)]
*  But he says we are motivated, we are going to fight for Ukraine. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=53.48s)]
*  And on the surface, as he calls it, you can see all the people of Ukraine, ordinary citizens [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=56.64s)]
*  like you and me, who are setting about defending their country from this brutal invasion. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=62.64s)]
*  What do you think Vladimir Putin's end goal is here? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=71.56s)]
*  At first it was to extend an umbrella of protection to Russian speakers in Ukraine. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=75.0s)]
*  We knew that wasn't true. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=79.92s)]
*  Then it was to replace the government with one that once again was friendlier to Russia [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  than to the West. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=87.32s)]
*  But now this just looks like a campaign of destruction. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=88.32s)]
*  It does. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=93.44s)]
*  It looks like a campaign of vengeance because it was not the cakewalk that he was anticipating. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  I do think that Putin has had an obsession with Ukraine for many years. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  He's made that clear in his writings and in his actions. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  He invaded Georgia in 2008. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  He invaded Ukraine in 2014, as you recounted. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=114.0s)]
*  And he got away with both of those actions. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=117.56s)]
*  And I think he thought he was going to get away with it again, that Ukraine would not [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=119.88s)]
*  be able to put up the kind of resistance that we are seeing, both on the part of the military [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=123.52s)]
*  as well as the government and the citizens of Ukraine. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=128.68s)]
*  And I think he badly underestimated the reaction of the international community, that we would [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=132.56s)]
*  be united in the face of what can only be called depravity. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=139.04s)]
*  Is there a world in which the Ukrainian people win this fight? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=145.16s)]
*  We've been speaking to members of parliament who say they've got the drive in them to do [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  it, but they cannot do it without more assistance from the globe. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=154.44s)]
*  Do you see there's any chance of Ukraine prevailing? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=158.64s)]
*  I think here's what I know. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=163.2s)]
*  Russia is not going to prevail. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=165.56s)]
*  Russia may, over time, if it really doubles down, they may win the war, but they are never [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=167.92s)]
*  going to win the peace, because the Ukrainian people will resist, as you are seeing them [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=175.64s)]
*  do every day right now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=181.56s)]
*  They will resist through a guerrilla movement. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=184.24s)]
*  They will resist through acts of civil disobedience. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=186.32s)]
*  They will make the price so high for a Russian occupation that it will not be sustainable. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=189.04s)]
*  Russia's miscalculation in invading Ukraine is a tragedy for the Ukrainian people and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=197.0s)]
*  the Ukrainian nation, but it is also a tragedy for the Russian people, whose future is now [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  being mortgaged by the blood and treasure that Russia is expending in Ukraine. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=210.12s)]
*  I want to ask you about this no-fly zone, whether it's a full one that the Ukrainian [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=216.76s)]
*  president is looking for or the one I just spoke to Ambassador Herbst about, a narrower [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=221.52s)]
*  one. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=226.4s)]
*  What do you believe the likelihood of something like that happening is, and what do you think [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=227.4s)]
*  the U.S. administration should be doing? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=231.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a very important question to ask. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  I think we need to ask ourselves, as the international community, how do we help Ukraine, how do [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=238.04s)]
*  we support Ukraine, how do we save Ukraine without expanding the war in ways nobody wants [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=245.24s)]
*  to see? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=251.52s)]
*  And on the one hand, I think that nobody wants to push Putin over the edge. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=253.12s)]
*  But on the other hand, what does it say about us and our values if we don't provide greater [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=259.16s)]
*  military assistance? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=268.04s)]
*  We have the means to stop or at least mitigate some of the worst carnage. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=269.68s)]
*  And as your previous guest said, will we at some later point have to intervene at a time [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=275.88s)]
*  that is perhaps more difficult? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=282.92s)]
*  I think this question of risk is a very important one. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=285.84s)]
*  We need to mitigate the risk. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=291.12s)]
*  But it's also true that not taking greater action comes with a risk as well, because [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=293.0s)]
*  Putin is a bully and he only understands strength. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnRD8y1X02E&t=301.64s)]
