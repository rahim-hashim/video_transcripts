# County Commissioners Who Won't Certify Election To Be Referred To A.G. For Prosecution
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo)
*  The consequences of former President Trump's claims that he won't respect election results, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=0.0s)]
*  the consequences of that continue to be felt all around the country, just all over the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  place. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=10.68s)]
*  The latest, weirdest consequence of that is happening right now in the great state of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=11.68s)]
*  New Mexico, where in one county, the three Republican county commissioners are refusing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=14.36s)]
*  to certify the election results in their county from this month's primaries. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=19.34s)]
*  The commissioners haven't raised any actual concerns about anything going wrong in those [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=23.28s)]
*  elections. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=27.44s)]
*  Don't want to certify the election results because they don't feel good about it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=28.6s)]
*  New Mexico's secretary of state stepped in and brought a lawsuit to the state Supreme [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=34.0s)]
*  Court yesterday. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=37.92s)]
*  Today, the state Supreme Court ordered those county commissioners that they need to certify [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=38.92s)]
*  the election results by Friday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=43.56s)]
*  One of the commissioners has already suggested that she'll laugh off any such order from [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=45.92s)]
*  a court, saying, what, you're going to put me in prison? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=49.84s)]
*  The question is, what does happen if they continue to refuse to obey the state Supreme [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=53.16s)]
*  Court? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=57.040000000000006s)]
*  And what happens to the votes of all those people who voted in New Mexico? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=58.12s)]
*  Joining us now is New Mexico's secretary of state, Maggie Toulouse Oliver. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=62.0s)]
*  Madam Secretary, thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=65.24s)]
*  It's a pleasure to have you here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'm happy to be here, Rachel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=71.08s)]
*  Have I explained any of this wrong? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=72.08s)]
*  I am a little bit new to this story. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=73.88s)]
*  I've been reading local coverage and that's pretty much how I understand it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  But tell me if I've missed out anything important. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=78.4s)]
*  No, it's it's a very cut and dried situation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=80.4s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=85.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=86.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=87.24s)]

*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=89.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=90.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=91.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=92.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=93.24s)]

*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=97.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=98.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=99.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=100.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=101.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=102.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=103.24s)]
*  I think it's a very difficult situation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=104.24s)]
*  Of course, they've chosen to do none of that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=106.24s)]
*  And they based their unlawful action not to certify the election on, as you, I think, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=109.24s)]
*  have accurately summarized, their feelings about the election machines. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=115.24s)]
*  And that is not within the context of the law, within the scope of their authority. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=120.24s)]
*  And quite frankly, you know, I think what we're looking at is a concern for a democratic, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=125.24s)]
*  a breakdown of our democracy and a breakdown of the process moving forward if they don't [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=131.24s)]
*  do the right thing and what the Supreme Court has ordered them to do. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=135.24s)]
*  So the Supreme Court has ordered them to certify these election results. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=138.24s)]
*  We don't yet know what the response from the commissioners will be to that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=142.24s)]
*  I will note that you raised the prospect in the press release announcing that you were [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=146.24s)]
*  taking this writ to the Supreme Court over this matter. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=150.24s)]
*  You raised the prospect that there could potentially be a criminal referral to the state [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=153.24s)]
*  attorney general's office in terms of these county commissioners violating their their [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=158.24s)]
*  oaths of office. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=162.24s)]
*  When one of these commissioners sort of laughed off the prospect of complying with a court [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=164.24s)]
*  order here saying, what are you going to do? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=168.24s)]
*  Put me in prison. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=170.24s)]
*  I think she thought that was a ridiculous prospect, but it sounds like that might not be a [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=171.24s)]
*  ridiculous prospect. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=174.24s)]
*  I don't think it is ridiculous. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=176.24s)]
*  We are making that referral to the attorney general. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=178.24s)]
*  This commission has taken a number of unlawful actions over the course of the last couple [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=181.24s)]
*  of weeks. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=186.24s)]
*  They took a vote which is ultimately symbolic, but to ban the state certified voting systems [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=187.24s)]
*  in their county. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=193.24s)]
*  They took a vote to remove certified monitored containers to receive absentee ballots or [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=194.24s)]
*  mail-in ballots, which is also counter to state law. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=201.24s)]
*  And then they ordered or were attempting to order a hand recount of the results. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=204.24s)]
*  And none of those are provided for in state law. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=209.24s)]
*  Now, mind you, the irony of this entire situation is that if they certify the results, there [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=213.24s)]
*  are a number of processes that can then take place, and particularly for candidates who [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=219.24s)]
*  may have questions about the outcome of the election. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=224.24s)]
*  We can undertake recounts. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=226.24s)]
*  We can undertake rechecks of the voting system. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=228.24s)]
*  But unless and until this commission and their capacity as the canvassing board does their [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=231.24s)]
*  mandatory duty, we can't do any of that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=236.24s)]
*  And so we have made that referral or we're going to be making that referral shortly. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=239.24s)]
*  And quite frankly, criminal prosecution is on the list as well as removal from office for these [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=244.24s)]
*  commissioners who are violating the law. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=250.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=252.24s)]
*  New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Chalouse Oliver. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=253.24s)]
*  I'm sure you never anticipated your duties as Secretary of State requiring this kind of action. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=256.24s)]
*  But here you are. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=261.24s)]
*  Thank you very much for helping us understand it tonight. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=262.24s)]
*  Please stay in touch with us about this story as it moves forward. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=264.24s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=267.24s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6joyUvnTPo&t=268.24s)]
