Video Description: Rachel Maddow reviews the remarkably sparse qualifications J.D. Vance offers both as a campaign partner and as a potential vice president (and even a senator), and points out Vance's interest in changing the American system of government, which is the qualification that most appeals to Donald Trump, confident of a win.

# Rachel Maddow exposes the real reason JD Vance was chosen to be Trump's running mate
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg)
*  Even though the audience, the television audience for this convention thus far has not been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=0.0s)]
*  particularly large by modern standards, one might expect that people will tune in tonight [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=4.74s)]
*  to hear from this new running mate for Donald Trump, who many people will have never heard [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=10.24s)]
*  of before this week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=15.16s)]
*  J.D. Vance is not a widely known public figure. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=16.36s)]
*  He is best known for having written a well-received autobiography, which he started while he was [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=19.6s)]
*  at Yale Law School. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=26.64s)]
*  Mr. Vance also served for six months in Iraq as a public affairs unit officer in the Marine [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=29.0s)]
*  Corps. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=33.88s)]
*  Excuse me, served in a public affairs unit in the Marine Corps. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=34.88s)]
*  Yes, even the Marines do have public relations. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=37.44s)]
*  They're great at it, in fact. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=41.04s)]
*  But that is the type of unit, a public affairs unit, that he was in when he was in Iraq. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=42.38s)]
*  After he did his law degree, again, at Yale, he became a protege of a very right-wing billionaire, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=46.72s)]
*  who you might remember from the first Republican national convention that nominated Donald Trump [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=54.2s)]
*  for president. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=58.56s)]
*  He had a primetime speaking slot. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=59.56s)]
*  It was one of the weirder speeches of the 2016 RNC. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=60.88s)]
*  His name is Peter Thiel. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=64.36s)]
*  He got J.D. Vance a job at a biotech company in San Francisco after J.D. Vance graduated [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=66.60000000000001s)]
*  from law school. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=73.44s)]
*  Peter Thiel got him that job, literally. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  The company's CEO says explicitly that J.D. Vance was hired, quote, as a favor to Peter, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=77.84s)]
*  meaning as a favor to Peter Thiel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  Peter Thiel then got J.D. Vance a second job. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=86.56s)]
*  He directed one of his venture capital companies that they, too, should hire J.D. Vance. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=89.8s)]
*  See, this is why these guys are so against any kind of affirmative action, because clearly [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  they got where they are in this life out of sheer merit, as represented by having your [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=100.2s)]
*  billionaire friend call people and tell them to hire you, even though they're not sure [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  why they're supposed to be hiring you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=109.12s)]
*  After Mr. Vance washed out of the second job that Peter Thiel gave him, Mr. Vance [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=112.12s)]
*  then got another job at a different venture capital firm with another tech billionaire, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=116.72s)]
*  with Steve Case, who founded AOL. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  How did that one work out? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=123.2s)]
*  Mr. Case is on the record saying, quote, he wasn't really working very much. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=124.68s)]
*  Nevertheless, Mr. Vance then was able to go and start another venture capital firm with, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=130.88s)]
*  Surprise, yet more help from Peter Thiel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=138.44000000000003s)]
*  Like Mr. Thiel, who has named his companies after things in the Lord of the Rings series [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=142.8s)]
*  of J.R.R. Tolkien books, Lord of the Rings is a sort of favorite cosmos for naming things [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=146.84s)]
*  and cultural references for a lot of far right and alt right figures, both in Europe and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=154.5s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  Peter Thiel names all these things after Tolkien figures and places, like his company Palantir, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  for example, like his mentor, like Peter Thiel, who had given him all his jobs in the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=164.96s)]
*  world. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=169.84s)]
*  Mr. Vance also, when he founded his own venture capital firm with help from Peter Thiel, named [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=170.84s)]
*  it after a Lord of the Rings thing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=175.96s)]
*  He called it Narya, N-A-R-Y-A, which you can remember because it's Aryan, but you move [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=177.56s)]
*  the end of the front. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=182.82s)]
*  Apparently, that word has something to do with elves and rings from the Lord of the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=184.4s)]
*  Rings series. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=188.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=189.36s)]
*  In his new firm, Mr. Vance made one notable investment in one Kentucky company. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=190.64s)]
*  That Kentucky company went public and then promptly went bankrupt. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  So that's the career. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=198.82s)]
*  Does that sound like the rocket fuel trajectory of a person on a fast track to be nominated [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=202.72s)]
*  as the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party of the United States before he turns [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=207.92s)]
*  40? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=212.64s)]
*  No, it does not. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=213.64s)]
*  Writing a memoir and otherwise being Peter Thiel's intern is not usually the way you [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=215.0s)]
*  get to be a vice presidential nominee. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=220.08s)]
*  It's not usually the way you get to be a United States senator either, but it is the way you [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=222.12s)]
*  get to be a U.S. senator if you're J.D. Vance. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=226.52s)]
*  J.D. Vance's campaign for the U.S. Senate was the first time he ever ran for anything. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=229.72000000000003s)]
*  His campaign was substantially, emphasis on substantially funded by Peter Thiel, who dumped [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  $15 million into a super PAC that supported J.D. Vance's run for Senate. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=241.4s)]
*  That super PAC then further effectively took over the operation of the campaign and ran [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=246.64s)]
*  most of it for Mr. Vance. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  And after Peter Thiel personally took J.D. Vance to meet Donald Trump, literally Peter [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=257.12s)]
*  Thiel physically walked him into the meeting and presented him to Trump. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=263.08s)]
*  That is how Vance got the Trump endorsement for that U.S. Senate seat, which is all you [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=268.64s)]
*  need to win a Republican primary for Ohio Senate in 2022. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=272.8s)]
*  That's how he won the Republican primary. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  He then vastly underperformed other Ohio Republican candidates on the general election ballot [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  in 2022, but he did win, which is how he got into the United States Senate a grand total [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=286.36s)]
*  of a year and a half ago. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=293.2s)]
*  And that's how he got to be the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party right now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  As internships go, that's a really good internship. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=302.08s)]
*  The choice of J.D. Vance to be Donald Trump's running mate is reportedly a decision that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=306.56s)]
*  was only made at the very last minute, like the day before it was announced. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=311.56s)]
*  You do not choose a person like Mr. Vance because you think you need help winning the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=315.68s)]
*  election. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=320.12s)]
*  When they chose J.D. Vance, they did not think they needed any help winning this next election. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=322.32s)]
*  If you're trying to make up for some soft spots, some weaknesses in the Republican Party's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=328.52s)]
*  electoral prospects, you do not, for example, choose a vice presidential running mate who [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=332.96s)]
*  is on the record on tape taking this position. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=337.79999999999995s)]
*  I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=342.32s)]
*  I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  2022 podcast interview first on Earth by CNN Today in which J.D. Vance says, I certainly [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  would like abortion to be illegal nationally. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=356.32s)]
*  Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, whatever you think about his politics and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=362.32s)]
*  his political instincts, he's been very open about the fact that he sees the Republican [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  Party's strong stance against abortion, particularly a strong stance for a national abortion ban [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=369.56s)]
*  as an electoral loser. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=376.4s)]
*  Even though Mr. Trump is the one who orchestrated the overturning of Roe vs. Wade and therefore [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=378.8s)]
*  the Republican abortion bans all over the country, Trump has admitted that strongly [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=383.64s)]
*  restrictive stances on abortion, particularly a nationally restrictive stance on abortion, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=388.36s)]
*  will cost the Republicans elections they could otherwise win. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=393.4s)]
*  So then why do you pick J.D. Vance to be a running mate? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=397.96s)]
*  If you are Donald Trump and you pick a running mate and you're looking to pick a running [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=400.68s)]
*  mate to help your electoral prospects because you're worried about your chances of winning [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=404.44s)]
*  would never pick Mr. I would certainly like abortion to be illegal nationally. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=409.12s)]
*  You would never pick a national abortion ban guy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=414.72s)]
*  You would also not pick a guy who says we're in a quote late Republican period in this [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=419.6s)]
*  country and he doesn't mean capital R Republican. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=424.88s)]
*  He means small R Republican, meaning we are at the end of being a Republic. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=427.6s)]
*  J.D. Vance quoting there, a far right internet personality and blogger who famously advocates [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=432.88s)]
*  openly for the United States to become a monarchy or an outright dictatorship who has [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=438.08s)]
*  called for abolishing the U.S. government, the U.S. system of government being abolished [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  so we can instead be ruled by a Caesar figure. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=447.68s)]
*  That is who J.D. Vance has been citing when he talks about us being in a late Republican [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  period as a country. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  That's what he thinks about where we are as a country and where we should go as a country. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=458.79999999999995s)]
*  You do not pick a man like that if you are worried about your electoral prospects. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=464.28s)]
*  The man who created J.D. Vance as a political figure out of whole cloth and gave him all [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=469.76s)]
*  his jobs and also his seat in the U.S. Senate and also his introduction to Trump. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=474.2s)]
*  He says he does not believe freedom is compatible with democracy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  He wants freedom so that means he does not want democracy. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=483.76s)]
*  If you are Donald Trump and the Republican Party and you are worried about your ability [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=487.2s)]
*  to win this election in November, you would not pick J.D. Vance as your vice presidential [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=491.4s)]
*  candidate. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  You can only pick a candidate out there as J.D. Vance if you are really thoroughly quite [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=499.08s)]
*  sure that you are going to win no matter what kind of craziness you put on the ticket and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=504.92s)]
*  what you are going to bring into the White House with you. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=510.68s)]
*  J.D. Vance is not the guy you pick to win over suburban women or whatever. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRNy8v_Ocgg&t=513.72s)]
