# 'A terrible moment for our country': Clinton reacts to string of Donald Trump indictments
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI)
*  All over the country right now, people are wondering what Hillary Rodham Clinton is thinking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=0.0s)]
*  watching things unfold in Georgia. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=5.32s)]
*  She is the former Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Senator from New York and Secretary [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=7.92s)]
*  of State. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=11.4s)]
*  I should tell you, she has a new essay out in the Atlantic on the well-being of Americans [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=12.4s)]
*  in our democracy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=16.1s)]
*  It's called The Weaponization of Loneliness. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=17.1s)]
*  Madam Secretary, fancy meeting you here. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=20.16s)]
*  It's really nice to have you here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=21.84s)]
*  Oh, I can't believe this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=22.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=23.84s)]
*  This is not the circumstances in which I expected to be talking to you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=24.84s)]
*  Nor me, Rachel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=28.12s)]
*  It's always good to talk to you, but honestly, I didn't think that it would be under these [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=29.6s)]
*  circumstances. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=35.72s)]
*  Yet another set of indictments. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=36.72s)]
*  This is something, this is becoming like a skill set. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Like in the news business, you say like, oh, I've covered Olympics or I've covered a campaign. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=42.72s)]
*  Now it's, you know, those of us who've covered four indictments. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if four is it. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=49.8s)]
*  We don't know if Donald Trump is among those indicted this evening, but all expectations [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=51.82s)]
*  are that he will be. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=55.3s)]
*  Do you feel satisfaction in that? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=59.24s)]
*  You warned the country essentially that he was going to try to end democracy, but most [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=63.92s)]
*  of the country didn't believe you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=68.04s)]
*  Well, it's hard to believe. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=69.52s)]
*  I don't feel any satisfaction. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=71.0s)]
*  I feel great, you know, just great profound sadness that we have a former president who [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=72.56s)]
*  has been indicted for so many charges that went right to the heart of whether or not [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=80.92s)]
*  our democracy would survive. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=88.28s)]
*  And we don't know yet what the charges coming out of Georgia are. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=90.16s)]
*  But if you stop and think about what the public evidence is, and you've been talking about [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=93.8s)]
*  some of that for the last hour, he set out to defraud the United States of America and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=98.3s)]
*  the citizens of our nation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=104.64s)]
*  He used tactics of harassment, intimidation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=107.44s)]
*  He made threats. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=112.88s)]
*  He and his allies went after state officials, local officials responsible for conducting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=114.08s)]
*  elections. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=120.28s)]
*  Now we know they even went into voting machines in order to, you know, determine whether or [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=121.56s)]
*  not those voting machines had somehow been breached when they were the ones actually [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=128.16s)]
*  doing the breaching. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=132.84s)]
*  So there is a great deal already in the public record. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=134.36s)]
*  We'll wait to see what the indictments themselves say, because clearly this investigation has [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=138.04s)]
*  been very thorough. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=142.56s)]
*  But I don't know that anybody should be satisfied. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=145.52s)]
*  This is a terrible moment for our country to have a former president accused of these [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=148.44s)]
*  terribly important crimes. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=156.12s)]
*  The only satisfaction may be that the system is working, that all of the efforts by Donald [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=159.96s)]
*  Trump, his allies and his enablers to try to silence the truth, to try to undermine [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=166.24s)]
*  democracy have been brought into the light, and justice is being pursued. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20zw43j9haI&t=173.04000000000002s)]
