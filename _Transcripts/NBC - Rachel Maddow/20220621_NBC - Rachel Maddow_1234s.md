# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: June 20
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM)
*  I think it's worth knowing that Rusty Bowers, again, a witness you'll hear from live tomorrow, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=0.0s)]
*  he is, in one particular and important way, he is everything that Bill Barr and Mike Pence [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  and all these other supposed heroes of this story are not. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=12.32s)]
*  However much people like Attorney General Bill Barr or Vice President Pence have been [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=17.44s)]
*  lauded over the course of this investigation, because at the very, very end, when it came [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=21.32s)]
*  and the final, final, final accounting, they didn't ultimately go along with the last worst [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  thing that Trump asked them to do. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=32.76s)]
*  However much they are being lauded for not being as bad as Trump and not being willing [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=34.92s)]
*  to do everything he wanted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=39.96s)]
*  One thing that neither of those men did in the moment, not Bill Barr, not Vice President [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=43.739999999999995s)]
*  Pence, not Trump lawyer Eric Hirschman, not Pence lawyer Greg Jacob, not Trump campaign [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=47.72s)]
*  manager Bill Stepien, not any of these guys we have heard from thus far. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=53.0s)]
*  They're all taking their bows now for not putting on a Viking hat and smashing windows [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=57.36s)]
*  with the rest of the mob on January 6th and good for them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=61.32s)]
*  But one thing that none of them did in the moment was tell us, tell the public what was [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=64.36s)]
*  happening in the White House that they were so disturbed about. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=70.88s)]
*  None of them was willing to sound the alarm in the moment to say, hey, the president is [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=74.0s)]
*  trying to get people to do something illegal here and we're worried it's going to get [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=78.32s)]
*  people killed on January 6th. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=81.52s)]
*  None of them went to the public with their concerns in real time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=84.06s)]
*  But you know who did do that in real time? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=87.96s)]
*  The Arizona very conservative Republican Speaker of the House, Rusty Bowers, who is going to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=91.38s)]
*  testify tomorrow. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=97.14s)]
*  Again, I have no idea what he will be like as a witness or what he will testify to. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=98.14s)]
*  But the historical record will show that he actually got this part of it right when almost [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=102.24s)]
*  nobody else did. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=108.12s)]
*  As he was getting calls from President Trump himself and from Rudy Giuliani and from all [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=110.5s)]
*  these other people in the president's orbit, Rusty Bowers not only didn't go along with [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=114.62s)]
*  their demands that he should throw out Arizona's election results, he kind of alone among all [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=118.74s)]
*  these guys is the one who put out a press release telling everybody that actually that's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=124.66s)]
*  what they were pressuring him to do. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=130.9s)]
*  They were pressuring him to overturn the state's election results and that's wrong and he [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=132.52s)]
*  needed everybody to know it in the moment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=135.82s)]
*  Look at this document. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  This is what you show St. Peter at the pearly gates. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=139.76s)]
*  This is your whole pass for up there at the end of your life as a public official if your [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  name is Rusty Bowers. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=146.2s)]
*  See the date on it? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=149.16s)]
*  That's a very important date. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=150.32s)]
*  December 4th, 2020 for immediate release. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=151.84s)]
*  Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers today made the following statement, quote, This week, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=155.6s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis and others representing President Donald Trump came to Arizona with [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=160.28s)]
*  a breathtaking request that the Arizona legislature overturn the certified results of last month's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=164.35999999999999s)]
*  election and deliver the state's electoral college votes to President Trump. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=170.0s)]
*  The rule of law forbids us to do that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=173.08s)]
*  Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Ellis made their case here at least twice on Monday at an unofficial [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=175.88s)]
*  public gathering hosted by a small group of legislators and again on Tuesday during a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  closed door meeting at the state Capitol with Republican leaders from both chambers of the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=185.0s)]
*  legislature. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=189.28s)]
*  Both times the Trump team made claims that the election was tainted by fraud, but presented [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  only theories, not proof. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=195.94s)]
*  Again, keep in mind what's going on here, right? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  This this this is the one dog that barked. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=201.84s)]
*  He is alerting the public to the fact that there's been an unofficial gathering between [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=205.68s)]
*  Republican legislators and people from the Trump campaign. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  And then following that, a closed door meeting between Republican leaders in the state legislature [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  and people from the Trump campaign. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=218.20000000000002s)]
*  And this guy, the Republican House Speaker, says, hey, this might be happening behind [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=219.96s)]
*  closed doors, but the public needs to know about this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=223.12s)]
*  I'm going public. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to tell the public what's going on here and also that I'm not going to stand [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=226.96s)]
*  for it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=231.0s)]
*  I'm not going to go along with it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=232.0s)]
*  He says, quote, Even if such evidence existed, the Arizona legislature simply couldn't do [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=233.0s)]
*  what is being asked. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=239.28s)]
*  Under Arizona law, presidential electors must vote for the winners of the popular vote. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  Nothing in the U.S. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=245.44s)]
*  Constitution or the decisions of the U.S. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=246.44s)]
*  Supreme Court even suggests that the Arizona legislature could retroactively appoint different [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  electors who would cast their ballots for different candidates. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  The law does not authorize the legislature to reverse the results of the election. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=256.86s)]
*  As a conservative Republican, I don't like the results of the presidential election. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=260.98s)]
*  I voted for President Trump. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=264.94s)]
*  I worked hard to reelect him, but I cannot and will not entertain a suggestion that we [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=266.22s)]
*  violate the law to change the outcome of a certified election. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=270.6s)]
*  I and my fellow legislators swore an oath to support the U.S. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=274.58000000000004s)]
*  Constitution and the laws of the state of Arizona. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=277.34000000000003s)]
*  It would violate that oath, the basic principles of Republican government and the rule of law. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=280.72s)]
*  If we attempted to nullify the people's vote based on unsupported theories of fraud, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=285.94s)]
*  Arizona voters choose who wins. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=290.42s)]
*  And our system requires that their choice be respected. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=292.78s)]
*  He then concludes with this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=296.0s)]
*  Forty years ago next month, President Ronald Reagan reminded us that while the orderly [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=298.06s)]
*  transfer of authority is a commonplace occurrence for Americans, quote, In the eyes of many [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=301.88s)]
*  in the world, this every four-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=307.18s)]
*  miracle. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=312.34s)]
*  Rusty Bowers concludes, quote, Now Americans are being reminded once again never to take [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=313.73999999999995s)]
*  for granted what President Reagan correctly described as the continuity, which is the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  bulwark of our republic. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=322.4s)]
*  Again, look at the date on that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=325.34s)]
*  December 4th, 2020. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=327.82s)]
*  That's more than a month before the January 6th attack. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=329.82s)]
*  The Republican House speaker in Arizona saying, Yeah, I want to Trump to win. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=333.21999999999997s)]
*  I voted for Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=337.26s)]
*  But here he is sounding the alarm, telling the public that what the Trump campaign was [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=338.52s)]
*  asking for behind closed doors was blatantly illegal. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=341.94s)]
*  He went to the public. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=346.18s)]
*  He said, This is breathtaking. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=347.18s)]
*  That's the word he used. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=348.18s)]
*  A breathtaking request. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=349.7s)]
*  Telling the public no way would he do it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=351.62s)]
*  And correctly saying that what Trump was asking for and the fact that he was asking for it [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=353.54s)]
*  would be the end of the peaceful transition of power in our country. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=358.7s)]
*  Rusty Bowers was right. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=362.38s)]
*  And almost no one else in Republican politics was willing to tell that truth to the public [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=364.18s)]
*  about it at that point. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=369.58000000000004s)]
*  All these people who are sort of getting it right in retrospect, right? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=374.02000000000004s)]
*  He got it right in the moment. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=376.46000000000004s)]
*  It isn't based on any evidence. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=399.54s)]
*  It's not based on any facts. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=408.22s)]
*  Who needs them? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=409.5s)]
*  That was a county commission meeting in Otero County, New Mexico this past Friday. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=410.5s)]
*  County commissioners met to certify the results of recent elections, elections in which there [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=415.38s)]
*  were no complaints about fraud or irregularities at all. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=420.42s)]
*  As we reported on the show last week, Republicans in Otero County were threatening this county [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=424.72s)]
*  that they wouldn't certify the election results because something, something Donald Trump, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=429.5s)]
*  voting machines, bamboo fibers, Rudy Giuliani, something, something not really based on any [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=434.7s)]
*  facts, just bad feelings. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=439.5s)]
*  On Friday, the state Supreme Court in New Mexico ordered the county to drop the nonsense [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=441.82s)]
*  and certify the elections. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=445.85999999999996s)]
*  They did by two to one vote. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=447.53999999999996s)]
*  The one no vote was that disembodied voice you heard at that meeting on Friday saying [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=450.65999999999997s)]
*  he was still voting no, but not because of any facts. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=455.3s)]
*  The reason he's a disembodied voice at that meeting is because he had to phone into that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=459.06s)]
*  hearing from D.C. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=462.26s)]
*  He was in D.C. because he was being sentenced by a federal judge for his part in the January [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=463.62s)]
*  6th attack. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  So that's how it worked out in Otero County. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=468.90000000000003s)]
*  Court order begrudging agreement. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=472.98s)]
*  But look at this. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=476.1s)]
*  Look at what happened that same day in two other counties in New Mexico as officials [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=477.1s)]

*  results anymore. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=544.72s)]
*  I mean, what happened in Otero County for all its clownishness was the first overt act [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=545.72s)]
*  we have seen taken by a Republican-dominated elections body to nullify election results [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=552.6s)]
*  just on the basis of fact-free Trumpian extremism, just as a matter of Trumpy principle. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=558.12s)]
*  That happened in Otero County last week, but seeing other counties facing the same pressure [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=564.76s)]
*  is a clear and dark sign of where things are headed, right? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=569.4s)]
*  This is not the same as angry conservatives showing up to complain at a local school board [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=572.0s)]
*  meeting or a zoning committee. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=575.68s)]
*  This is don't certify election results anymore. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=577.32s)]
*  This is an organized anti-small-D democratic movement in our country pushing to nullify [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=580.9s)]
*  all election results. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=586.84s)]
*  And it is spreading. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=589.34s)]
*  It has started. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=590.7s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=592.28s)]
*  Shae Moss had been a longtime election worker in Fulton County. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=599.28s)]
*  For this election, Fulton County looked like it was going to be short-staffed because of [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=603.1600000000001s)]
*  COVID, so Ms. Moss recruited her mom to sign up as a temp worker for Election Day. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=606.0s)]
*  That video that Trump and company got so fixated on, all that video showed was Shae Moss and [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=612.76s)]
*  her mom, these two election workers, literally just doing their jobs on election night, taking [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=619.16s)]
*  ballots out of the secure containers they were transported in like they were supposed [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=623.36s)]
*  to and running them through the ballot counting machine like they were supposed to. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=627.02s)]
*  But Trump and Giuliani and all the Trump folks and our friends at Fox News kept running this [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=632.04s)]
*  snippet of video over and over again saying that it showed a crime, even though it actually [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=637.32s)]
*  showed just normal election workers doing normal stuff the normal way with no malfeasance [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=641.9s)]
*  whatsoever. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  But them fixating on this video, Trump not only showing the video, the conservative media [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=648.92s)]
*  showing the video, Giuliani showing the video, and Trump specifically naming the women in [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=653.28s)]
*  the video as the ones who stole the election from him, that had profound consequences. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=658.14s)]
*  Shae Moss and her mom, even her teenage son, got inundated with vulgar and racist harassment [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=663.24s)]
*  and death threats. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=670.64s)]
*  Shae Moss's mother called 911 multiple times because people were showing up at her house [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=672.64s)]
*  banging on her door making threats in person. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=677.8399999999999s)]
*  Lord Jesus, where's the police? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=700.42s)]
*  This became their lives. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=726.36s)]
*  Shae Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, in the midst of all those harrowing threats and [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=728.5s)]
*  intimidation, something else happened. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=733.4599999999999s)]
*  That tape, that 911 tape was from December 2020. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=738.22s)]
*  The following month in January 2021, actually two days before the January 6th attack, a [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=741.4599999999999s)]
*  woman showed up on Ruby Freeman's doorstep, said she had been sent by a high profile individual [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=748.22s)]
*  and she was there to help Ms. Freeman. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=752.8199999999999s)]
*  This woman told Ruby Freeman that she was in danger. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=756.14s)]
*  She told her that people were coming to her house in 48 hours and she was going to be [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=758.8s)]
*  locked up. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=762.9s)]
*  That woman who came to Ruby Freeman's house and made that apparent threat, it turned out [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=764.84s)]
*  in the end that she at least some point had been a publicist for the troubled Trump-supporting [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=770.12s)]
*  hip-hop artist Kanye West, which is the celebrity thing that got all the well this is weird [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=774.5s)]
*  kind of headlines about this incident. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=779.6s)]
*  You might remember that. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=782.84s)]
*  Where did the Kanye West publicist fit into all of this? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=783.9s)]
*  The way that actually resolved and what you should know ahead of Ms. Moss' testimony [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=787.22s)]
*  at tomorrow's hearing is that we here on this show actually later determined that that [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=791.46s)]
*  woman who showed up on Rudy Freeman's doorstep had been dispatched there by a Trump campaign [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=796.96s)]
*  operative. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=801.1800000000001s)]
*  When that woman came to Ruby Freeman's house, Ms. Freeman was so freaked out after a month [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=802.1800000000001s)]
*  of threats and harassment that while she said she was willing to talk with this person, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=806.1800000000001s)]
*  she would only agree to do so at the local police station. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=811.86s)]
*  That was the only place she felt safe meeting this random stranger. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=815.5s)]
*  And so she went and met with her at the police station. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=818.74s)]
*  And because it was at the police station, part of their meeting was caught on a police [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=821.2s)]
*  body cam, which Reuters obtained. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=824.22s)]
*  We didn't want to frighten you, but we had to find you within this timeframe. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=827.62s)]
*  We've put in place a way to move you, to secure you from what may be authorized over [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=830.5s)]
*  the next 48 hours. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=834.98s)]
*  I can't say specifically what will take place. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=836.1400000000001s)]
*  I just know it will disrupt your freedom and the freedom of one or more members of your [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=838.48s)]
*  family. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=842.48s)]
*  This is January 4th. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=843.48s)]
*  The woman then says she's going to put Ruby Freeman on the phone with somebody, quote, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=847.52s)]
*  very high level, with the authoritative powers to get you the protection that you need. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=850.6800000000001s)]
*  Protection from what? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=856.9200000000001s)]
*  Ruby Freeman told Reuters that once this other person, a man, got on the phone with her, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=859.2800000000001s)]
*  he and this woman who had come to her house to try to get her to try to talk to her about [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=863.52s)]
*  moving her and because something terrible is going to happen to her within 48 hours, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=868.42s)]
*  the man on the phone and that woman at the police station with her tried to get her to [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=872.38s)]
*  admit to committing election fraud. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=875.86s)]
*  Ruby Freeman says the woman told her, quote, if you don't tell everything, you're going [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=878.66s)]
*  to jail. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=882.6999999999999s)]
*  Now what's important about this, other than the bizarreness of it, is that the quote very [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=885.1s)]
*  high level guy who Ruby Freeman got put on the phone with, this person who could supposedly [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=890.28s)]
*  get Ruby Freeman protection from what was otherwise going to happen to her if she just [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=894.24s)]
*  confessed and otherwise she and a family member or more than one family member were all going [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=898.3s)]
*  to go to jail. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=903.02s)]
*  Turns out that guy worked for the Trump campaign. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=904.3s)]
*  He had been the paid executive director of a Trump campaign group called Black Voices [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=906.8399999999999s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=910.5s)]
*  He told us that he was the one who sent that woman to Ruby Freeman's house in January. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=911.56s)]
*  He claimed he was acting as a private citizen. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=916.22s)]
*  When he did that, he said he was no longer on the Trump payroll. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=918.2399999999999s)]
*  He also said that he personally never threatened Ms. Freeman. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=920.88s)]
*  He told Reuters he received calls from people offering Ruby Freeman immunity if she confessed [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=924.68s)]
*  to election fraud, but he wouldn't say who those people were or on what authority they [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=930.42s)]
*  would have been able to offer her immunity and immunity from what? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=935.0s)]
*  What would she be prosecuted for? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=938.76s)]
*  She did not actually commit election fraud. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=940.2399999999999s)]
*  But again, this all happened on January 4th, and they keep giving her this deadline, right, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=944.56s)]
*  by which she needs to act, she needs to confess, or she's going to get taken away, and maybe [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=949.18s)]
*  they can move her, maybe they can keep her safe. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=952.5s)]
*  Forty-eight hour deadline. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=955.02s)]
*  Well, what was happening 48 hours from January 4th? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=956.02s)]
*  Why was it so important that they get her to confess to election fraud within 48 hours [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=959.2399999999999s)]
*  of January 4th? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=963.9s)]
*  Well, 48 hours later, of course, was January 6th, when Trump was planning to pressure Mike [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=965.3399999999999s)]
*  Pence into stopping the certification of Biden's election win. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=972.6s)]
*  And it would have, of course, been really handy to have a forced confession, a forced [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=977.08s)]
*  false confession of election fraud to point to that day as a reason to throw out the Georgia [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=981.32s)]
*  results or at least to delay certifying them because there was some great new controversy [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=985.9200000000001s)]
*  in Georgia. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=990.08s)]
*  What exactly were they threatening Ruby Freeman with? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=994.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, as far as there being some threat to Ruby Freeman that would materialize 48 hours [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=997.02s)]
*  from January 4th, well, it did actually materialize. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1002.54s)]
*  According to a lawsuit Ms. Freeman filed against a right-wing website that promoted false stories [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1006.06s)]
*  about her, 48 hours after that visit from the Trump folks on January 6th, while pro-Trump [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1010.02s)]
*  rioters were storming the Capitol in Washington, a pro-Trump crowd also stormed her house, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1015.62s)]
*  surrounded Ruby Freeman's house outside Atlanta, shouting at her through a bullhorn. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1022.1s)]
*  Fortunately, nobody was hurt. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1026.6799999999998s)]
*  She by then had already fled her home for her safety, following the FBI's advice to [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1028.08s)]
*  do so. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1033.6399999999999s)]
*  And of course, Ruby Freeman, the 62-year-old election worker, grandmother from Atlanta, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1037.3999999999999s)]
*  did not confess to some invented charge of election fraud, right, despite this implied [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1042.72s)]
*  threat, this dangled promise from people connected to the Trump campaign that it would [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1048.96s)]
*  relieve the pressure on her and only then could they keep her safe. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1052.32s)]
*  The harassment and the threats turned Ruby Freeman's life upside down, turned her daughter [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1056.56s)]
*  Shea Moss's life upside down. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1060.94s)]
*  It has been a total nightmare for them, and they did nothing wrong. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1063.06s)]
*  But it is also still coming full circle. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1068.78s)]
*  Since then, the January 6th investigation has revealed not only that the claims about [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1073.1s)]
*  fraud in Fulton County were false, but that Trump was told in detail by the number two [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1077.6599999999999s)]
*  official at the U.S. Justice Department that the whole attack on that mother and daughter [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1083.04s)]
*  in Atlanta, the whole suitcases full of ballots claim, all these supposed fraud claims about [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1087.32s)]
*  Fulton County, Georgia, were nonsense. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1091.3600000000001s)]
*  And we know that because we have tape from Richard Donahue, the number two official at [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1094.0s)]
*  the Justice Department after Bill Barr left. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1098.2s)]
*  We have tape of his deposition to the January 6th investigation. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1100.72s)]
*  And I said something to the effect of, sir, we've done dozens of investigations, hundreds [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1105.92s)]
*  of interviews. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1109.8s)]
*  The major allegations are not supported by the evidence developed. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1111.5s)]
*  We've looked at Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1115.38s)]
*  We're doing our job. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1118.82s)]
*  Much of the info you're getting is false. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1120.86s)]
*  And I said, okay, well, with regard to Georgia, we looked at the tape, we interviewed the [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1123.9s)]
*  witnesses. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1127.62s)]
*  There is no suitcase. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1129.24s)]
*  The president kept fixating on this suitcase that supposedly had fraudulent ballots and [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1130.46s)]
*  that the suitcase was rolled out from under the table. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1134.94s)]
*  And I said, no, sir, there is no suitcase. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1138.44s)]
*  You can watch that video over and over. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1140.76s)]
*  There is no suitcase. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1142.52s)]
*  There is a wheeled bin where they carry the ballots. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1143.52s)]
*  And that's just how they move ballots around that facility. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1147.66s)]
*  There's nothing suspicious about that at all. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1149.84s)]
*  I told them that there was no multiple scanning of the ballots. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1155.74s)]
*  One of the one part of that allegations that they were taking one ballot and scanning it [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1159.04s)]
*  through three or four or five times to rack up most presumably for Vice President Biden. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1163.36s)]
*  I told them that the video did not support that. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1169.06s)]
*  Pulled him flat out that much of the information he's getting is false and or just not supported [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1171.74s)]
*  by the evidence. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1177.58s)]
*  We look at the allegations, but they don't pan out. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1179.3799999999999s)]
*  The number two official at the Justice Department told President Trump personally and in detail [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1182.98s)]
*  this suitcase thing, this fantasy about some nefarious thing in Fulton County, Georgia, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1188.84s)]
*  that you've ascribed to these women who you have named, who you have sicked your supporters [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1193.78s)]
*  on to the point where they've been driven into hiding at the advice of the FBI. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1197.84s)]
*  This thing that you've been saying is not true. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1202.74s)]
*  Nothing you're saying about that is true. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1205.28s)]
*  Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shea Moss, did nothing wrong. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwpphQHxbXM&t=1208.1999999999998s)]
