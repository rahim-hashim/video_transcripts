# How Should The U.S. Approach Policy As Putin Grows More Belligerent?
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg)
*  There were a lot of headlines earlier today about progress being made in peace talks between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=0.0s)]
*  Russia and Ukraine, with even Russia's foreign minister saying today that there was some [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=4.96s)]
*  hope of a breakthrough in talks. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=9.6s)]
*  But Russia's leader had some different thoughts. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=11.72s)]
*  Vladimir Putin struck a defiant and dark tone, saying that his, quote, special operation [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=14.88s)]
*  was developing successfully in strict accordance with pre-approved plans. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=20.6s)]
*  He claimed that the invasion was a fight for Russia's sovereignty and said the West is [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=26.94s)]
*  trying to split Russia into parts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  The authoritarian leader wanted to make sure he was clear, quote, we will never allow Ukraine [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=34.88s)]
*  to become a stronghold of aggressive actions against our country, end quote. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=40.22s)]
*  But he also delivered the starkest threats to Russians who oppose him and his so-called [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=45.46s)]
*  spell it the special military operation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=51.34s)]
*  Putin said, quote, the Russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=54.34s)]
*  from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=58.82000000000001s)]
*  their mouths. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=65.94s)]
*  I am convinced that such a natural and necessary self-purification of society will only strengthen [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=67.5s)]
*  our country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=74.86s)]
*  Those startling comments come after the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=76.98s)]
*  hearing yesterday on combating authoritarianism. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=80.58000000000001s)]
*  The committee called the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Anne Applebaum, an expert on authoritarianism, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=83.94s)]
*  to testify. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=88.94s)]
*  She said the U.S. needs to do more to combat Russia's authoritarian leader. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=90.02s)]
*  Western sanctions alone have no impact on autocrats who know they can continue to trade [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=96.98s)]
*  with one another. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=101.18s)]
*  Accusations from human rights organizations mean nothing to dictators. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=102.5s)]
*  Russia invaded Ukraine in part because the Russian president believed he would pay no [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=106.14s)]
*  price. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=110.06s)]
*  We are always reacting to the latest outrage. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=111.18s)]
*  We need to change the rules of the game altogether. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=113.78s)]
*  Joining me now is Anne Applebaum. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=118.9s)]
*  She's a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, a staff writer at the Atlantic. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=120.22s)]
*  Ms. Applebaum, thank you for being with us. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  I want to ask you, when you say we've got to change the rules of the game, that we have [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=125.82000000000001s)]
*  to stop being reactive, in this context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, how would [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=130.38s)]
*  you have seen it going differently? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=135.94s)]
*  And how in the middle of the game do you change? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=138.06s)]
*  So there's the famous Irish joke about, you know, if you want to get to Dunleary, you [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=142.18s)]
*  don't start from here. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=148.54s)]
*  And so, yes, I wouldn't have started from here, from where we are. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=149.98s)]
*  I would have pushed back against not just Russian kleptocracy but international kleptocracy [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=154.1s)]
*  many years ago. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=159.3s)]
*  We could have changed our laws in order to make it impossible to buy and sell property [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=160.94s)]
*  anonymously in our country and in other countries. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=166.86s)]
*  We could have thought differently about how we communicate to Russians and to others. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=169.86s)]
*  In the middle of the war, it's a much more difficult prospect, although I do hope that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  this war is going to give us some ideas for how to proceed in future. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=179.06s)]
*  In the middle of the war, what I think we need to do is change our thinking. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  I feel that's maybe beginning to happen in Washington. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  We need to begin to think not just about damage limitation or about how to grind down [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=191.48s)]
*  the Russians slowly, but about how we're going to help Ukraine win. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=197.48s)]
*  And by winning, I mean expel the Russian troops from their country and create some kind of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  stable, long-lasting permanent peace. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  And that is a very large ask from where we are now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=211.22s)]
*  But if we make that our goal and then we work backwards, which arms do we need to give the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=214.33999999999997s)]
*  Ukrainians in order for them to push out the troops? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=219.16s)]
*  What kind of final settlement will achieve what we want it to achieve? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=222.64s)]
*  We're not looking for a second best outcome. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=226.72s)]
*  We're looking for the best outcome. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  If we start to think like that, that will help guide us in our policy from now on. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiKs39o4pCg&t=230.76s)]
