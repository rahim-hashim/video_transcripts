# Trump's Long-Time Accounting Firm Dumps Him On Valentine's Day
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc)
*  Attorney General James is still trying to get President Trump and his adult [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=0.0s)]
*  children Don Jr. and Ivanka to sit for a deposition as part of her investigation. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=4.46s)]
*  And today on Valentine's Day no less we learned from new court documents that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=9.72s)]
*  President Trump's longtime accounting firm is ours which helped Trump put [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=15.18s)]
*  together those financial statements that firm is breaking up with him. In a [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=20.06s)]
*  letter to the Trump Organization dated last week the accounting firm started by [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=25.7s)]
*  writing explicitly that all of the statements of financial condition it [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=29.74s)]
*  put together with Trump to evaluate his company's financial situation from 2011 [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=34.26s)]
*  to 2020 those should quote no longer be relied upon. It continued we have come to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=39.339999999999996s)]
*  this conclusion based in part upon the filings made by the New York Attorney [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=47.18s)]
*  General our own investigation and information received from internal and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=51.34s)]
*  external sources. Due in part to our decision regarding the financial [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=55.9s)]
*  statements as well as the totality of the circumstances we have also reached [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=60.46s)]
*  the point that there is a non-waivable conflict of interest with the Trump [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=65.06s)]
*  Organization. As a result we are not able to provide any new work product to the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=70.62s)]
*  Trump Organization meaning that's it. Relationship over. The firm will not even [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=76.86s)]
*  finish Donald and Melania's taxes this year. And this is really saying something [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=85.74s)]
*  because Trump's past statements of financial condition were filled with [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=91.14s)]
*  many many disclaimers to lower Mazar's risk. Like this one from the first [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=94.86s)]
*  paragraph of Trump's 2011 statement quote we have not audited or reviewed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=100.58s)]
*  the accompanying financial statement and accordingly do not express an opinion or [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=105.3s)]
*  provide any assurance about whether the financial statement is in accordance [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=109.41999999999999s)]
*  with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=113.58s)]
*  So Trump's accounting firm had already been hedging its cosign on Trump's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=117.58s)]
*  financial statements for over a decade and now the firm is going even further [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=122.69999999999999s)]
*  saying it wants nothing to do with any of this. They are out. They quit. Don't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  let the door hit you on the way out and if you are the former president finding [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=134.22s)]
*  a replacement firm may not be easy. According to various reports the former [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=138.18s)]
*  president is somewhere in the ballpark of hundreds of millions of dollars in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=142.98s)]
*  debt. Reports of that debt vary from 400 million dollars to over a billion [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=147.22s)]
*  dollars. Even if you were to give or take 200 million that is still a lot of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=152.98s)]
*  debt. And this letter from his longtime accountant very publicly bailing on the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=159.5s)]
*  former president will likely make it very hard for him to find new partners [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=164.54s)]
*  willing to refinance that debt or let him take on future loans. I am not a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=169.1s)]
*  lawyer and I'm sure not an accountant but this all seems bad. What does it [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  mean practically for Donald Trump and for the New York Attorney General's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=182.54s)]
*  investigation into Trump's finances? Joining us now is Barbara McQuade former [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=187.1s)]
*  U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. Barbara thanks as always [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=192.29999999999998s)]
*  for joining us. Let's start first with this line from the letter about Mazar's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=195.7s)]
*  having a non-waivable conflict of interest against working with a Trump [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=200.66s)]
*  organization. Does that effectively mean that Mazar's is on the Attorney General [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=205.54s)]
*  Leticia James side now? You know I don't know exactly what it means but what it [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  does say is you know in the law when a lawyer wants to quit a client they [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=215.54s)]
*  typically use words like irreconcilable differences, the relationship has broken [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=220.06s)]
*  down to the point that they can no longer serve them effectively and I [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=225.06s)]
*  think that's what it means but to talk about a conflict of interest goes a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=228.94s)]
*  little above and beyond that and does suggest that you might be on the wrong [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=232.1s)]
*  side of the V in a lawsuit when it's for example people of the state of New York [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=235.62s)]
*  versus Trump. So I don't know if it means they're cooperating but I do think it [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  means that they can no longer vouch for the reliability of financial documents [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=243.9s)]
*  they prepared on behalf of the Trump organization. You know I think that the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=248.74s)]
*  phrase that comes to my mind is garbage in garbage out and so it may be that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=253.06s)]
*  they prepared financial documents based on the data they received but they have [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=257.5s)]
*  now learned perhaps that that data was inaccurate and therefore the financial [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=262.42s)]
*  statements that they prepared utilizing that data are also inaccurate. Do we have [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=266.82s)]
*  a sense that if Mazar's is cooperating we know that one of their officers has [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=271.82s)]
*  already testified to a grand jury that that could be problematic for the Trump [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=276.66s)]
*  organization? Oh I think so you know an accountant has access to a lot of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=280.9s)]
*  information obviously to prepare your tax records to put together financial [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=285.9s)]
*  statements and so that could be very damning information. You know one of the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  cases that comes to my mind a case I watched covered for the show was the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=295.9s)]
*  trial of Paul Manafort. Remember he had financial crimes that he was convicted [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=299.65999999999997s)]
*  of bank fraud and tax cases claims and other things. Some of the key witnesses [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=304.53999999999996s)]
*  in his case were his accountants and some of the things they testified about [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=310.3s)]
*  were he gave me information that I relied on in preparing these financial [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=313.74s)]
*  documents. I have now learned that that information was false and so because of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=318.38s)]
*  that the documents that I produced was false. So in the same kind of way I could [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=323.02000000000004s)]
*  imagine that Mazar's is cooperating with the Attorney General. They don't want to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  get crosswise with with the government. They will produce documents that they [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=331.7s)]
*  believe comply with accounting principles but if they learn that the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=336.1s)]
*  raw data that was used in those documents was wrong I think you'll see [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=339.74s)]
*  them run from those documents which appears to be what's happening here. I [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=343.38s)]
*  feel like this is actually the textbook definition of running right. Don't pay [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=346.54s)]
*  any attention to the last decade of documents we gave you. I wonder to what [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=350.42s)]
*  extent should we expect this development to affect the criminal probe being led [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=354.94s)]
*  by the Manhattan DA's attorney, a Manhattan district attorney into Trump's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=359.74s)]
*  finances. We know there are parallel probes right. Is this going to bleed over [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=363.18s)]
*  into that the civil crime the civil case into the criminal case. I think it [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=367.06s)]
*  absolutely could. That case also depends on the same idea of fraudulent [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=371.78s)]
*  representations about Trump's financial worth and so you know the statements are [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=377.42s)]
*  typically that he inflated some of his assets when it suited him. If he was [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=382.1s)]
*  applying for a loan, if he was seeking insurance coverage, if he was looking for [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=387.9s)]
*  tax deductions, he would inflate to the tune as you said two hundred million [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=391.65999999999997s)]
*  dollars overestimating the size of his apartment from 100 to 300,000 square feet. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=395.38s)]
*  Huge amounts of inflation of these assets and then on other occasions when it [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=400.94s)]
*  suited him like paying his tax bill he would take the same assets and reduce [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=407.7s)]
*  their value and so sometimes you can look objectively at these documents and [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=411.7s)]
*  see you know in one year you claimed is worth 200 million dollars and the next [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=415.7s)]
*  year you said it was 400 million dollars. Some of those just don't add up on their [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=419.94s)]
*  face and so I would imagine that not only are those the basis of these civil [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=423.98s)]
*  fraud claims but could very well be the basis of bank fraud or tax fraud from a [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=428.66s)]
*  criminal perspective in the Manhattan DA's investigation. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgaql1qSpc&t=434.3s)]
