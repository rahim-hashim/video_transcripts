# Clever Tactics By Ukrainian Forces Stymie Russian Military Despite Power Imbalance
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE)
*  On the first day of the war, Russian forces took control of a nearby airport, a military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=0.0s)]
*  airport, leading many people to believe that Kiev would fall shortly thereafter. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=5.24s)]
*  But the front lines near that airport outside of Kiev, while fluid, have not moved considerably [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=11.52s)]
*  in two weeks. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=16.88s)]
*  The Washington Post reports that Ukrainian forces have taken the shrewd approach of retreating [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=19.16s)]
*  to the cities, conserving their weaponry and focusing on defending their positions in those [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=23.56s)]
*  cities instead of attacking. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=29.46s)]
*  They've blown up bridges. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=31.5s)]
*  They've lined the roads into the city with obstacles, while still managing to keep corridors [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=33.06s)]
*  open for fleeing civilians. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=37.1s)]
*  And they say they are ready for any Russian advance that comes their way. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=39.34s)]
*  Joining us now from Kiev, Sudarsan Raghavan, correspondent at large for the Washington [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=45.74s)]
*  Post, whom I am happy to announce as of tonight, is an MSNBC contributor. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Sudarsan, thank you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=55.34s)]
*  Welcome to the team. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=57.58s)]
*  And tell us more about this, because I was just speaking to people, including Richard [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=58.58s)]
*  Engel, who is explaining that this tactic that the Ukrainian army, that none of us would [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=61.86s)]
*  have known or thought would be that strategic or prepared, given their history in that country, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  has been remarkably effective against a much bigger, much more mighty army. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=73.3s)]
*  Great to be with you, Ali. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=81.06s)]
*  It's glad to be an MSNBC contributor. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=82.06s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, look, everyone expected the Russians to have entered Kiev by now. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=85.22000000000001s)]
*  But what we're seeing is an unbelievably stiff resistance by the Ukrainian forces. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  And it is a very smart move. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=97.42s)]
*  They understand that they don't have the type of the massive weaponry, the Russian staff. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=99.26s)]
*  So what instead they're doing is they have retreated back to the cities. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  They're using guerrilla-style tactics. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=107.34s)]
*  They've dug trenches in places like Irpin, which is a city just north of, on the northern [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=110.14s)]
*  edges of the capital of Kiev, and a key gateway into the city that the Russians are trying [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=116.26s)]
*  to push through. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  They are inside people's houses. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  They are in, they are behind trees, positioned, camouflaged and ready for the Ukrainians to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=125.34s)]
*  come down streets. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=133.26s)]
*  But at the same time, what they're, what they've told me they're being helped by is the Russia, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  is Russia's own unpreparedness, the Russian soldiers' lack of understanding of the geography [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=140.17999999999998s)]
*  of the Ukrainian terrain. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=146.42s)]
*  There have been examples of, you know, of Russians, you know, running out of food and [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=149.1s)]
*  other supplies on gas as well, turning down wrong streets inside Irpin and then suddenly [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  getting targeted by an anti-tank missile. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=161.5s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, definitely the Ukrainians are using the smart. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=165.42s)]
*  And the other thing they're not doing is they're not counterattacking. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=169.26s)]
*  So there's this one place where I was, one front line a couple of days ago in which it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=172.86s)]
*  was shelled by the Russians at least 20 or 25 times during the night. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=177.9s)]
*  And the Ukrainians told me they didn't reply once because they didn't want to, they wanted [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=182.78s)]
*  to conserve their weaponry. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=188.78s)]
*  But at the same time, they didn't want to turn that front line into a battle zone because [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=190.14s)]
*  civilians were fleeing along that very road. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=194.29999999999998s)]
*  And so when I asked them, you know, what happens if, you know, at some point if Russian tanks [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=198.94s)]
*  do come through, then, you know, one of the commanders went and grabbed an En-Law anti-tank [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=203.73999999999998s)]
*  missile, which was inside a warehouse, and basically said, we're ready. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=213.26s)]
*  One of the, you know, a lot of the people I'm talking to, particularly these members [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  of parliament who have taken up arms and joined the civilian militias, they are talking about [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=219.26s)]
*  their morale. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=223.73999999999998s)]
*  And the morale has kept that country alive far larger than U.S. intelligence thought [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  it would survive a Russian onslaught. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=229.42s)]
*  On the other side, there's an argument that there's a lack of morale for those Russian [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=231.73999999999998s)]
*  soldiers who are sort of less clear about why they're fighting, combined with the fact [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=235.98s)]
*  that they're in unfamiliar territory and they're getting into urban warfare with people [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=239.98s)]
*  who know the local terrain. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=243.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=247.82s)]
*  You've got to understand that, you know, before the war started, actually even now, I mean, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  there's an intense propaganda by the Kremlin, and that's reaching these Russian soldiers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=251.98s)]
*  They actually thought at one point that the Ukrainians are going to welcome them with [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=258.46s)]
*  flowers. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  That was all over social media. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=264.3s)]
*  Instead, so, you know, so they were expecting pretty much of an easy fight coming in. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=266.46s)]
*  Instead, what they found is a very strong resistance that's not only including the military, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=270.94s)]
*  but also civilians. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=279.26s)]
*  You know, they've joined by the thousands to participate in resisting the Russian forces. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=281.1s)]
*  And they're doing this in many different ways. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  Many have joined these territorial defense units who are now posted at checkpoints all [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=290.54s)]
*  around Kiev, as well as fighting inside Erpin in that area. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=295.9s)]
*  But they, you know, but it's more than that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=301.73999999999995s)]
*  I mean, some of the soldiers in Erpin were telling me that they're actually getting [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=304.14s)]
*  information from civilians wherever there was cell phone network, which is it's scanned. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=308.62s)]
*  But there are some areas where people still call out of Erpin, and they were giving positions [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=313.41999999999996s)]
*  of Russian tanks and artillery so that the Ukrainians can then use their own weaponry [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=318.14s)]
*  to target them. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=324.38s)]
*  So it's a very cohesive resistance that's involving not just the military, but civilians as well. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9saWmdjpNmE&t=325.34s)]
