# Trump case facts too well known for book to threaten prosecution: Pomerantz
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc)
*  I mentioned in the introduction that there were at least nine different sort of criminal [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=0.0s)]
*  areas of inquiry—areas of inquiry about potential criminality that the DA's office [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  was looking into at the time that you joined. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=11.34s)]
*  You say one of them was the hush money payment to Sturmey Daniels. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=14.6s)]
*  Another one was taxes, potential improper business expense deductions, deductions of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=17.72s)]
*  consulting fees. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=21.94s)]
*  In his relationship with Deutsche Bank, could he have defrauded Deutsche Bank by getting [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=23.92s)]
*  financing through overstated financial statements, whether he'd engaged in money laundering [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=27.18s)]
*  through Deutsche Bank using overseas bank accounts, the accuracy of materials he provided [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=32.5s)]
*  to the GSA about the old post office, and a host of other things, including insurance [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=37.66s)]
*  fraud, the restructuring of his loan on his Chicago skyscraper. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=43.18s)]
*  You go on and on and on. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  When you describe that litany of areas of potential criminal inquiry for Trump and when [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  you describe your reasoning and the debates between you and your team about the hush money [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=54.059999999999995s)]
*  thing, are you giving a potential lifeline to Donald Trump's defense lawyers that if [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=60.66s)]
*  they do end up getting charged with anything related to any of those items, including the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=66.38s)]
*  hush money matter, that your book could be used as evidence, essentially, to try to question [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=70.74s)]
*  the charges in court, to say, look, prosecutors have been looking at this stuff for a long [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=76.9s)]
*  time. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=80.38s)]
*  Responsible prosecutors looked at this, decided there was nothing there, and didn't charge [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=81.38s)]
*  it in the past. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=83.54s)]
*  This is selective prosecution or this is an overreach. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=84.9s)]
*  Have you given the defense a leg up here? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=88.86000000000001s)]
*  Look, I don't think we've given the defense any kind of leg up. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=90.78s)]
*  When you look at the public reporting about the grand jury presentation that may now be [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  underway, obviously, I don't know what's going on behind closed doors in the DA's office, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=100.66000000000001s)]
*  and I don't know what evidence is being presented. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=106.5s)]
*  I don't know whether charges will be brought. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=109.42s)]
*  But as it relates to the hush money circumstances, those facts have been known literally for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=111.78s)]
*  years. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  Michael Cohen wrote about them in his book. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  He testified about them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=122.42s)]
*  Stormy Daniels wrote a book. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=123.9s)]
*  Stormy Daniels appeared on Michael Cohen's podcast to talk about it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=125.54s)]
*  And the federal prosecutors brought their own prosecution based on those facts. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=130.3s)]
*  So I'm not letting any cats out of the bag, if you will. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  Those cats have been running all over the place literally for years. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=138.94s)]
*  But the reasoning about whether or not to bring charges based on those facts, is that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=143.5s)]
*  potentially helpful to any defense counsel? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=147.06s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  The legal issue that I've noted in the book is an issue that appears on the face of the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=150.66s)]
*  statute. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=156.02s)]
*  It's already been written about, was written about before my book has come out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=157.02s)]
*  On the financial statement side of the coin, we don't know, I certainly don't know what [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=162.66s)]
*  investigation is taking place, if any. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=169.22s)]
*  I don't know whether charges will ultimately be brought. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=172.22s)]
*  What I do know is that the evidence underlying the charges we intended to bring is all out [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=175.7s)]
*  there in the public record in the civil case that the attorney general of the state of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=182.14s)]
*  New York, Letitia James, brought. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=186.78s)]
*  She filed a civil complaint of well over 200 pages, which lays out in abundant detail [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=189.46s)]
*  the assets that were misvalued, the basis for the overvaluation of the assets. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=197.94s)]
*  That is how she concluded and why she concluded that the assets were overvalued. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=203.62s)]
*  And the evidence that we were looking at in connection with a potential criminal case [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=208.62s)]
*  has been laid out in chapter and verse in that complaint. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=214.34s)]
*  And again, there is nothing in my book about the financial statement investigation, the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=218.78s)]
*  criminal investigation that we were doing. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=226.74s)]
*  There are no new facts that don't appear in the attorney general's complaint. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=229.14s)]
*  So I was pretty well satisfied when I wrote the book that I wasn't going to interfere [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=233.22s)]
*  with any potential prosecution. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=240.1s)]
*  Look, I wrote the book in part to say there should have been a criminal prosecution. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=242.3s)]
*  There needs to be a criminal prosecution. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=248.86s)]
*  The last thing I would have done is to do something that would get in the way of a criminal [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=251.54s)]
*  prosecution that I thought and still think should be brought. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8KzkyiOHDc&t=256.78s)]
