# Ukrainians See Putin Crossing Red Lines That Warrant NATO Intervention
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ)
*  I want to turn now to Ina Sovson. She's a member of the Ukrainian parliament. She's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=0.0s)]
*  joining us live from Kyiv. Miss Sovson, thank you again for being with us. I know it's the middle [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=3.52s)]
*  of the night. You have two hats. On one hand, you're a member of parliament. On the other, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=8.64s)]
*  you've been involved in the people that Kal was just talking about. 10 million people, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=13.36s)]
*  not in their homes, 4 million having fled the country. This humanitarian disaster is almost [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=21.12s)]
*  overtaking the discussion about NATO and its relationship with Ukraine and what its obligations [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=26.88s)]
*  are. Well, truly, it is a terrible disaster, humanitarian disaster here in Ukraine. We just [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=32.08s)]
*  got some polls released, which says that 44% of Ukrainians had their families split because of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=40.08s)]
*  the war. So part of the family is living in one place. Another part of the family is living in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=46.32s)]
*  a different place. That is 44%. That's half of the Ukrainians were not living with their loved ones. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=50.56s)]
*  And that is extremely difficult. That is extremely complicated. I'm saying as a mom, I was not able [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=55.84s)]
*  to see my son for three weeks. I didn't want to see him last week. I came back to Kyiv. However, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  I haven't seen my boyfriend since day one of the war. It's extremely complicated, extremely [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=67.92s)]
*  difficult. But we all understand that the only solution to that is just help us win in this war [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=73.92s)]
*  and then we can be reunited with our loved ones. You heard Cal talking about the fact that the NATO [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=79.84s)]
*  leaders and perhaps President Biden will reiterate this concept of red lines that certainly [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  involve any kind of nuclear threat that Russia's got, but even chemical weapons. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=93.84s)]
*  Are you satisfied that that red line goes far enough, given the imagery that we're seeing, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=98.16s)]
*  the destruction of these homes, the forced movement of people out of the country or to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=103.92s)]
*  other parts of the country? Is chemical weaponry the right place for that line? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=109.92s)]
*  Well, there should definitely be the red line. All the stories I'm reading from Mariupol, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=116.64s)]
*  they all scream red line to me. I read the story about a woman who came to Hungary today and she [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=121.36s)]
*  came with four children. Only one of the children was hers. Another one was her niece. Her parents [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=129.6s)]
*  died. One more child was the child of the neighbors who died as well. And the fourth child, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=136.72s)]
*  she was just riding to the vacation bus and she saw a child who was sitting next to his [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=144.24s)]
*  dead parents scared and was just sitting on the street, didn't know what to do. She just [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=149.84s)]
*  grabbed the child and ran for the bus. So she brought their four children. Three of them were [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=153.84s)]
*  orphans. This is a story that I want the world to know. This is what is happening over there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=159.68s)]
*  So can you imagine a child, I was always thinking about my own son, if my son was sitting there [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=165.04s)]
*  with his parents dead and not knowing where to go and just randomly saved by a stranger, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=171.04s)]
*  that is what is happening there. That is the genocide. That is like the World War II. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=177.12s)]
*  I am just begging for the world to understand that this is as scary as it gets. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=181.44s)]
*  Even in Kiev, where it is rather quiet and it's much better than it was three weeks ago, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  we just got the warning that because of the fires in the Chernobyl nuclear area, which Russians are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=193.04s)]
*  not allowing to put down, there is more amount of cesium in the air. We are not allowed to open our [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=199.44s)]
*  windows and we are advised to wear masks on the streets. That is in Kiev. That is again the red [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=206.16s)]
*  line that we all understand that it is there. I just want the world to know that this is real. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=212.0s)]
*  This is really scary. And I think the red line has been crossed a long time ago. Just think about [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=218.24s)]
*  the child sitting next to his dead parents. I do believe that should be the red line. And I'm just, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=222.48s)]
*  I'm going to join my president in saying that we need the help, all the help that we can get [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=227.2s)]
*  to fight this monster. You are from the eastern city of Kharkiv. Last week we were talking about [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=232.48s)]
*  a fire in an open air market and you had talked about the fact that your father actually had [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=240.72s)]
*  worked there at some point. You've relocated your son, Martin, to western Ukraine. So you are seeing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=245.76s)]
*  all parts of this around the country. Western Ukraine is relatively peaceful right now. How do [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  you see this developing? We had a report that Ukrainian forces are actually pushing Russian [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=256.88s)]
*  forces back around Kiev. Yes, that is giving us hope. Of course we understand it's going to take [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=260.88s)]
*  a while. There are still many Russian troops around the city. But Ukrainian forces is really [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  regaining some parts of the city. But we are the heavy battles. We are seeing some lights and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=273.6s)]
*  explosions around the city. But we do hope that they will manage to push them further from Kiev. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=280.8s)]
*  But there are warnings and we all understand that this is the possibility that if Putin will [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=287.44s)]
*  realize that he's losing around Kiev totally, that he will go for the next step, which would [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=293.36s)]
*  be the chemical weapon, which we are all being warned about. So on the one hand, the fact that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=299.2s)]
*  Ukrainian army is regaining control over northwest of the city is giving us hope. On the other hand, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=304.56s)]
*  it is also scary because we don't know how Putin will react to that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=311.28s)]
*  Inna Sovson, there's no part of this war that has not touched you or your family and yet you take [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  time to talk to us. We appreciate that. It is important that this message gets to the world. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=322.32s)]
*  Inna Sovson is a member of the Ukrainian parliament. Thank you for your time. Please stay safe. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=326.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdPbzwt8duQ&t=346.64s)]
