# Prevalence of mass shootings extends reach of gun violence across communities
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw)
*  So this is how the news today in Nashville unfolded on live TV in that city. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=0.0s)]
*  This was in Nashville as it happened live on the Channel 4 local news. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=7.08s)]
*  We do anticipate this news conference starting any moment. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  This will be the first official news conference where we can hear where police are at in their [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=19.88s)]
*  investigation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  The news is live with some personal perspective on this as well. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=25.08s)]
*  Joy Lynn. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=30.72s)]
*  There's absolutely no words for what's going on today. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=31.72s)]
*  I'm actually a school shooting survivor myself. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  It happened years ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=39.0s)]
*  I was in eighth grade and all this is bringing, it's just flooding back flashbacks for me. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  And what I went through with my classmates, I was actually in the hallway during break [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=46.64s)]
*  the gunman opened fire shooting one of my peers and killing them and just after hearing [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=52.220000000000006s)]
*  the gunshots, I just knew to run and hide. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=58.06s)]
*  I hid underneath the risers of in my choir class and those minutes and hours of waiting [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=61.02s)]
*  to be released by police officers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=68.1s)]
*  I just felt like a lifetime. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=69.9s)]
*  That was today in Nashville. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=72.9s)]
*  And you know, this is obviously a really big country. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=75.98s)]
*  There's something like 800 different local news stations from coast to coast. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=79.22s)]
*  And so, you know, you have an obvious reaction to that video, right? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=83.22s)]
*  You watch that and you think, wow, what are the odds that this reporter, this person who [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=85.82000000000001s)]
*  survived a school shooting as a kid grew up to be a TV reporter who just happened to be [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=90.18s)]
*  the reporter on duty the same day there was a school shooting right down the street from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=96.42s)]
*  where she works? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=100.54s)]
*  What are the odds that the people who cover the news end up having a personal connection [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=101.54s)]
*  like that to the gun violence that they have to report on at work? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=107.38s)]
*  Well, it turns out in this country, the odds of that are really not terrible because this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=113.14s)]
*  was also today also in Nashville. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=118.1s)]
*  We're hearing from their administrators, letting them know that they are OK and that they are [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=122.82s)]
*  monitoring the situation closely. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=127.78s)]
*  Holly, Amanda. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=129.46s)]
*  Yeah, speaking of that, I'm getting emails from my child's school that they're going [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=130.18s)]
*  into lockdown at this time just as a precaution and that one of my other children's schools [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=133.78s)]
*  is working with security to make sure that they've got everything safe. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=140.82s)]
*  They're going to be OK. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=145.46s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=147.14s)]
*  It's going to be OK. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=147.54s)]
*  Both that anchor who you saw on set there at the end and the reporter who you saw just [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  before her, who herself was a school shooting survivor, they both work at the same local [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=155.54s)]
*  TV station in Nashville, Tennessee, a local NBC affiliate there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=160.26s)]
*  This was another local station in Nashville today. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=165.94s)]
*  This was News Channel 5 in Nashville this afternoon. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=168.34s)]
*  I am here now with Hannah and I understand you've been given a message. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=173.06s)]
*  Yeah, so I wanted to make sure it was OK with her before I talked about her experience. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=176.98s)]
*  My mother-in-law is the front desk angel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=183.22s)]
*  She is. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  And she was at the school this morning, however, Diana was able to come out of this safe. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=190.18s)]
*  She actually stepped away to take a break. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=198.58s)]
*  I mean, and that is why right now I am just, I'm torn. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=200.5s)]
*  Sure, it probably could have saved her life that she stepped away. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=204.66000000000003s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=208.18s)]
*  This nightmarish phenomenon of news reporters, news anchors finding themselves covering gun [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=210.82000000000002s)]
*  violence that is in real time threatening their own families or that is in real time [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=218.18s)]
*  calling back to the previous school shootings that they themselves have survived. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=223.22s)]
*  I mean, these dynamics, I mean, especially for those of us in this business, it's like [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=229.22s)]
*  something that you want to wake yourself up from, right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  But it's not just happening here and there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=238.74s)]
*  It is not even just a phenomenon that is unique to Nashville. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=241.86s)]
*  This, for example, was Wednesday. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=246.18s)]
*  This was five days ago in Denver, Colorado. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=248.02s)]
*  Sandra, that is so encouraging to hear as a parent. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=253.06s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=256.74s)]
*  My son just came up and I had not seen him. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=257.14s)]
*  Come up. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=260.02000000000004s)]
*  Come up here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=260.58000000000004s)]
*  So I'm sorry. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=262.02s)]
*  I've not seen my kid since this all went down. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=262.82s)]
*  So just really, just really, I'm so sorry. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=265.46000000000004s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  I just finished this real quick. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=269.22s)]
*  OK, OK, OK. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=270.58000000000004s)]
*  Are you good? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=271.94s)]
*  OK, I'm so sorry. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=272.42s)]
*  I just there's no way you would have let your kid. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=273.22s)]
*  You need to step aside, please do. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=276.02000000000004s)]
*  So OK, OK, he's OK. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=279.46000000000004s)]
*  He's good. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=281.3s)]
*  You're good. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=281.70000000000005s)]
*  OK, he's good. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=282.18s)]
*  But yeah, he's the one. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=283.94000000000005s)]
*  He's the one who was telling me what was happening. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=284.98s)]
*  And my sister telling me what her daughter was telling her. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=287.62s)]
*  He was the one who was telling me what was happening. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=291.46000000000004s)]
*  This reporter's source inside the school, the one giving her real time information about [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=293.38000000000005s)]
*  the shooter in that building. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=298.66s)]
*  Her source was her own son was a student at that school. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=300.82000000000005s)]
*  That was five days ago. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=303.70000000000005s)]
*  OK, just a few months ago, what happened in St. Louis? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  A radio reporter live on the air when her 17 year old daughter texted her that there [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=308.98s)]
*  was an active shooter inside her school. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  Quote, this morning I was on the air when my daughter began texting me that her school [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=315.38000000000005s)]
*  was on lockdown. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=318.66s)]
*  Sirens screaming. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=319.70000000000005s)]
*  Then I have to begin talking on the air about the latest school shooting in America. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  The one at my daughter's school. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=325.86s)]
*  It was October in St. Louis. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=328.90000000000003s)]
*  Look at these text messages. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=331.46000000000004s)]
*  This is an 18 year old college freshman, Emma Riddle. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=333.06s)]
*  She's in her dorm room at Michigan State earlier this year when she sent these texts to her [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=335.38s)]
*  dad. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=341.3s)]
*  The police say the shooter's at the I.M. East building, which is right next to us. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=341.62s)]
*  I'm in my dorm. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=344.9s)]
*  We're still in lockdown. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=345.94s)]
*  He hasn't been caught. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=346.9s)]
*  Her dad replies, what can I do? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=348.02s)]
*  And Emma writes back, I'm hiding under my desk with my roommate. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=351.22s)]
*  Just pray, please. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=353.86s)]
*  And remember that I love you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=354.5s)]
*  And her dad writes back, hey, I love you so much. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=355.7s)]
*  You're going to be OK. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=357.94s)]
*  I'm right here. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=359.14s)]
*  But then look at what Emma writes to her dad next. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=360.9s)]
*  I never thought I would have to go through this again. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=363.14s)]
*  Yes, again, because before Emma Riddle survived a school shooting, her freshman year of college [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=366.41999999999996s)]
*  just weeks ago at Michigan State, the same girl had previously survived a shooting at [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=371.94s)]
*  her high school when a gunman opened fire there and killed three students and injured eight others. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=377.85999999999996s)]
*  That was only in 2021. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=384.58s)]
*  Then she graduated high school, went off to Michigan State for college, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=386.82s)]
*  right into another mass shooting. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=390.97999999999996s)]
*  This young woman has survived two school shootings in the span of 15 months. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=392.97999999999996s)]
*  Gun murders, mass gun murders, are so common in this country that it's entirely possible [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=401.29999999999995s)]
*  that you might survive a mass shooting only to endure another one. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=406.02s)]
*  That is a thing that happens now in our country. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=409.7s)]
*  It is statistically possible. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=411.78s)]
*  Gun murders are, in fact, so common in this country that the shooter in one attack could [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=413.53999999999996s)]
*  shoot and kill 11 people, drive to a nearby parking lot to kill himself at the site of where [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=418.1s)]
*  another mass shooting had occurred just a few years prior. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=423.70000000000005s)]
*  That literally happened earlier this year. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTS5CFtZYAw&t=426.42s)]
