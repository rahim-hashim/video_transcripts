# Prosecutor's Resignation Letter Insists Trump Is Guilty Of Multiple Felonies: NYT
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA)
*  Exactly one month ago, the two prosecutors leading the Manhattan District Attorney's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=0.0s)]
*  investigation into Donald Trump and his business practices abruptly resigned. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=4.96s)]
*  Those two prosecutors had been leading a case that was centered around the allegation that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=10.66s)]
*  Trump was inflating the value of his assets in order to obtain favorable loans from banks. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=14.9s)]
*  By all accounts, it was an investigation that appeared to be gaining momentum. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=21.64s)]
*  But according to the reporting at the time, those two very high-profile prosecutors resigned [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=26.42s)]
*  after the newly elected DA tasked with overseeing the case, quote, indicated that he had doubts [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=32.08s)]
*  about moving forward with the case against Trump. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=38.08s)]
*  Now, tonight, The New York Times has published the resignation letter from one of those prosecutors, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=41.1s)]
*  and it is remarkable. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=46.7s)]
*  This is the resignation letter of Special Assistant District Attorney Mark Pomerantz, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=48.42s)]
*  sent to the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg last month, quote, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=53.26s)]
*  As you know from our recent conversations and presentations, I believe that Donald Trump [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  is guilty of numerous felony violations of the penal law in connection with the preparation [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=63.3s)]
*  and use of his annual statements of financial condition. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=68.86s)]
*  The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=72.74s)]
*  crimes. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  He did. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=78.42s)]
*  Mr. Pomerantz noted in his letter that the previous district attorney overseeing the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=80.06s)]
*  case, quote, concluded that the facts warranted prosecution, and he directed the team to present [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=84.17999999999999s)]
*  evidence to a grand jury and to seek an indictment of Mr. Trump and other defendants as soon [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=90.22s)]
*  as reasonably possible, end quote. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  The letter then explained that the current district attorney, Alvin Bragg, decided not [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=98.74s)]
*  to seek criminal charges, at least not yet, and that the investigation has been suspended [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=103.66s)]
*  indefinitely. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=108.88s)]
*  While Mr. Pomerantz did not question the district attorney's authority in making his decision [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=109.88s)]
*  or his sincerity in believing that it was the right call, he argues in the letter that, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=116.36s)]
*  quote, a decision made in good faith may nevertheless be wrong. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  I believe that your decision not to prosecute Donald Trump now and on the existing record [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=126.6s)]
*  is misguided and completely contrary to the public interest, end quote. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=132.32s)]
*  He continues, we believe that the prosecution would prevail if charges were brought and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=137.28s)]
*  the matter were tried to an impartial jury. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=142.24s)]
*  Whatever the risks of bringing the case may be, I am convinced that a failure to prosecute [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=145.32s)]
*  will pose much greater risk in terms of public confidence in the fair administration of justice. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=150.36s)]
*  I fear that your decision means that Mr. Trump will not be held fully accountable for his [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=157.24s)]
*  crimes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=162.48s)]
*  I have worked too hard as a lawyer and for too long now to become a passive participant [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=163.56s)]
*  in what I believe to be a grave failure of justice. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=169.4s)]
*  I therefore resign from my position as special assistant district attorney, effective immediately. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=173.72s)]
*  We should note the current Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, has said that his office [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=179.58s)]
*  continues to conduct this investigation and because of that he's barred from commenting [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=184.12s)]
*  on it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=188.26s)]
*  Mr. Trump, of course, denies the allegations of fraud. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=189.26s)]
*  Mr. Pomerantz himself declined to comment about the letter to the New York Times. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=192.17999999999998s)]
*  Joining us now is Barbara McQuade, the former United States attorney. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=196.45999999999998s)]
*  Barbara, good to see you tonight. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=199.34s)]
*  You're the person we need to talk to about this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=200.94s)]
*  This is quite a remarkable development that this kind of letter would be written. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=202.89999999999998s)]
*  It was probably not written to be leaked to the press, but what do you make of it? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=207.54s)]
*  It is a remarkable letter, Allie. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  When these two prosecutors resigned abruptly, as they did, I think most of us speculated [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=216.5s)]
*  that there was a difference of opinion as to the merits of this case and that they were [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=222.3s)]
*  leaving because Alvin Bragg had said that although the investigation was continuing, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=227.3s)]
*  we know that the grand jury activity had abated. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=231.74s)]
*  And so we knew that they were unhappy with the direction of the case. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=234.22s)]
*  And now we see why. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=239.9s)]
*  Although I'm not sure I agree with you that this wasn't written to be leaked to the press. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=242.02s)]
*  It is in such detail. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=246.5s)]
*  Certainly Alvin Bragg knew all of the reasons that Mr. Pomerance was resigning. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=248.54s)]
*  And so it seems like this one perhaps was written for the press. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=252.7s)]
*  And maybe it was—I don't know who leaked it to the press, but it seems like someone [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=256.14s)]
*  who leaked it to the press perhaps had an agenda. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  And so I think that might be an interesting question as to why is this out in the public [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=261.98s)]
*  domain? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  What is it that Mark Pomerance is trying to achieve? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  And it may be to put pressure either on Alvin Bragg or some other entity to pursue this [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=268.74s)]
*  case. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=273.5s)]
*  Well, let's explore that a little bit, because in the letter he talks about this being a [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=275.98s)]
*  failure of the justice system. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=280.02s)]
*  He doesn't want to be party to that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=282.7s)]
*  He says that the risks of not prosecuting are greater than the risks of prosecuting. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=285.14s)]
*  So tell me, in the system, inside the system, this gets leaked, puts Alvin Bragg on his [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=291.3s)]
*  back feet. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=298.38s)]
*  What exactly could happen as a result of this? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=299.38s)]
*  Well, I suppose, you know, Alvin Bragg is an elected official, that he might feel political [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=302.85999999999996s)]
*  pressure to go forward. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=307.06s)]
*  When people say even your own very skilled, very experienced prosecutors are telling you, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=308.76s)]
*  you have this case, you can't be too skittish. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=313.58s)]
*  Now you'll note there's nothing in the letter that accuses him of misconduct or corruption [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=315.82s)]
*  or anything like that, just that they have a difference of opinion. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=319.67999999999995s)]
*  But then Mr. Pomerance is absolutely convinced, as well as his colleagues, that there is a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=323.14s)]
*  crime here and that not only can it be brought, but it should be brought. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=326.94s)]
*  And so I suppose one goal for leaking this letter would be to put public pressure as [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=330.94s)]
*  an elected official on Alvin Bragg to take this step. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=336.26s)]
*  You know, I think it's also important to note, Ellie, that reasonable minds can disagree [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=340.9s)]
*  about whether charges should be brought. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=345.14s)]
*  There are certain kinds of crimes that are very obvious to us, a bank robbery. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=347.26s)]
*  We see the crime happen. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=351.4s)]
*  We know the crime happened. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=352.4s)]
*  The only question for trial really is whether this is the right defendant, whether this [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  is the person who did it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=357.02s)]
*  In these fraud cases, it's much more challenging because what it usually comes down to is knowledge [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=358.5s)]
*  and fraudulent intent. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=362.86s)]
*  And unless a person confesses to you, that evidence is never going to be crystal clear. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=364.54s)]
*  And so people will disagree as to how much is enough, how much inference are we going [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=369.3s)]
*  to ask a jury to make to conclude that in this case, Donald Trump did know that these [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=373.38s)]
*  statements were false and lies. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=378.56s)]
*  And so it may be that Alvin Bragg wants to amass more evidence before he's willing to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=381.06s)]
*  get there. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=385.0s)]
*  But what Mr. Pomerant seems to be saying is we've got all the evidence we're ever going [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=386.12s)]
*  to have. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=389.32s)]
*  It's not going to get better. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=390.32s)]
*  In fact, it's going to get worse as time passes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=391.32s)]
*  And now's the time to file this case. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=393.0s)]
*  And so perhaps he's saying if you won't, then perhaps the Southern District of New York [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=394.72s)]
*  will take note, or perhaps you could request that the attorney general's office, the state [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=397.76s)]
*  attorney general's office, get a referral and come in and take this case off your hands [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=401.64s)]
*  if you won't do it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIFwhDIjoFA&t=405.24s)]
