# Trump insiders knew power grab schemes were a 'crock,' Jan. 6 transcripts show
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU)
*  These late moves, these sort of dramatic maneuverings, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=0.0s)]
*  come even as the investigators release [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=3.0s)]
*  a lot of new information. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=5.14s)]
*  Last night, they posted a huge database [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=6.18s)]
*  of documents and material that was handed over to them [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=8.94s)]
*  by witnesses. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=11.58s)]
*  Among the revelations from those memos and texts [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  are lots of evidence of just how much all the people [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=15.38s)]
*  who were involved in helping Trump push the big lie, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=21.32s)]
*  how much they all knew that it was all a crock [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=23.62s)]
*  that they were pushing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=25.7s)]
*  When Rudy Giuliani's team tried to create [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=27.5s)]
*  a memo laying out proof of all the dead people who [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=29.66s)]
*  they said had voted, the members of his team [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=32.8s)]
*  ended up admitting in writing that all their so-called [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=36.06s)]
*  evidence of dead people voting was actually [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=38.96s)]
*  evidence of people who died after legally [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=40.84s)]
*  casting their ballots. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=43.88s)]
*  They put it in writing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=45.4s)]
*  I don't think this makes a particularly strong case. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=46.78s)]
*  When Trump started trying to stay in office [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=50.379999999999995s)]
*  by certifying fake electors in states that Biden had won, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  there was this text chain among Trump campaign communication [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=55.72s)]
*  staff and lawyers about how this strategy was [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  impossible to defend. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Quote, it's a crazy play, so I'm not sure who [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=63.54s)]
*  wants to put their name on it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=67.78s)]
*  Another White House official described this as, quote, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=69.97999999999999s)]
*  certifying illegal votes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=73.12s)]
*  Another official said, they can't anonymously [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=75.32s)]
*  stand behind this garbage. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=78.72s)]
*  Another one said, I can't stand by it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=80.92s)]
*  From the looks of it, neither can any of you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=83.24s)]
*  It's one thing to know that Trump's advisors were, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=87.22s)]
*  you know, skeptical of all the ways he was trying [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=89.82000000000001s)]
*  to stay in power illegally. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=92.26s)]
*  It's another thing to see how they talk to each other [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=93.84s)]
*  about it in real time, talking about how utterly [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=96.06s)]
*  indefensible it was and how they all wanted [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=98.7s)]
*  nothing to do with it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB5NYmXKojU&t=100.7s)]
