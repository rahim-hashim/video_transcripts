Video Description: Michael Scherer, national political reporter for the Washington Post, talks with Rachel Maddow about concerns among Democratic donors that Trump-supporting election deniers will win enough elected offices in 2022 that they'll be able to override the 2024 election results and install Donald Trump as president.

# Democratic Donors Back 2022 Races To Head Off Trump 2024 Plot
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc)
*  I'm going to show you a list of the top 20 donors, political donors to candidates in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=0.0s)]
*  the United States this current election cycle. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=6.54s)]
*  It's a list of the very, very rich people who donate more money than anybody else to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=8.64s)]
*  political candidates. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=12.5s)]
*  The top political contributor in the U.S. is Democratic donor George Soros. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=13.76s)]
*  You probably recognize his name. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=17.96s)]
*  He's the person your crazy uncle who watches Fox News all day blames every time the sun [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=19.44s)]
*  goes down at night or he doesn't win the Powerball again. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=24.62s)]
*  Darn you, Soros! [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=28.0s)]
*  Despite the prominence of George Soros on the list, the majority of the rest of these [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=30.52s)]
*  donors are actually people who donate to Republicans, like Trump mega-donors Larry Ellison and Peter [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=33.76s)]
*  Teel, who says it's such a drag that women were ever allowed to vote. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=39.8s)]
*  Things would definitely be better for Peter if that hadn't happened. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=44.08s)]
*  But there are a handful of other Democratic donors on the list, including Reid Hoffman, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=48.28s)]
*  who's founder of the website Linkedin. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=52.16s)]
*  Reid Hoffman is now one of the top donors to Democratic campaigns in the country in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=53.92s)]
*  this cycle. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=59.0s)]
*  And now this is the lead from the Washington Post today in terms of what to watch out for [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=60.08s)]
*  in donations in the next cycle. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=65.72s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=67.44s)]
*  Quote, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=68.44s)]
*  LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, one of the nation's top political donors, gathered more than a [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=69.44s)]
*  dozen billionaires or their representatives over Zoom on Friday to sound an alarm about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=72.44s)]
*  the coming elections. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  Hoffman was pitching some of the nation's wealthiest people on a doomsday idea that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=79.64s)]
*  has become a growing obsession. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=83.92s)]
*  One slide of the PowerPoint presentation that Hoffman gave to the group said, quote, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=86.2s)]
*  MAGA, make America great again, leaders, intend to use the 2022 midterms to install Trump [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=90.2s)]
*  in 2024, regardless of the vote. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=98.16s)]
*  A second slide titled How MAGA Midterms Can Install Trump laid out a step-by-step doomsday [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=101.6s)]
*  hypothetical scenario. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=108.08s)]
*  Republicans win statewide offices and key battleground states this year in 2022. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=110.28s)]
*  Then they change state laws in 2023 to give legislators control over presidential electors. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=115.24s)]
*  This new group of billionaires for democracy is called Investing in the U.S. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  The Washington Post points out that they are one of the most aggressive groups of big dollar [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=127.0s)]
*  donors invested in pushing back against what they see as a Republican plan to essentially [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=130.48s)]
*  unknit the sweater of American democracy so that Republicans just choose the next president, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=136.0s)]
*  regardless of how Americans vote. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=141.28s)]
*  Joining us now is Michael Shearer. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=143.64s)]
*  He's national political reporter for The Washington Post, who broke this story today. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=144.88s)]
*  Mr. Shearer, thank you for your time tonight. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=148.16s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=150.68s)]
*  You wrote about a number of different donor groups and some of their priorities and what [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=152.2s)]
*  they're spending on today. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=155.76s)]
*  I'm focused in on this bit of your reporting related to Reid Hoffman and his efforts because [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=156.76s)]
*  I feel like that doomsday scenario that he's describing to billionaire donors is a thing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=161.56s)]
*  that a lot of people on the left and in the center and even sort of just not Trumpy Republicans [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=166.48s)]
*  have been talking about as an inevitability for the country ahead of 2024. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=171.52s)]
*  It sounds like there is a lot of overlap between the elite donor conversation here and the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=178.56s)]
*  kind of word on the street for people who care about politics. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=183.04s)]
*  Do you get the sense that that's fair? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=185.84s)]
*  Yeah, and I think I was surprised reporting the story how broad that concern is among [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=188.32s)]
*  the donor community. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  I focused on Reid's presentation because it was so recent, so stark. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  But really, if you go through all the big donor groups on the Democratic side, and these [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  are mostly groups that pool donations for nonprofits. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=202.28s)]
*  A lot of this is not reported in the list of political donations. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=205.44s)]
*  These are, you know, lots of organizations that don't have to report where they're getting [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  their money. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=213.72s)]
*  This theme that the 2022 elections could determine the 2024 elections has really become [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=215.36s)]
*  a dominant one. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=219.88000000000002s)]
*  And so what you have is a narrowing and a shifting of where they're focusing their money. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  Instead of focusing just on the House map or just on the Senate map, which is typically [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=225.88000000000002s)]
*  what you do in a midterm election, they're focused narrowly on five to seven states where [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=229.8s)]
*  there's governor's races, where there's state Supreme Court races, secretary of state races. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  And they're really trying to win in those places to basically prevent Republicans from [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  getting trifecta control, controlling both the legislative houses and the governorship [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=244.92s)]
*  so that they could change the laws, either for voting, the rules of voting or changing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=249.4s)]
*  how electors are awarded. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=255.56s)]
*  And Michael, is there also effectively sort of a public education component to this, too, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=258.28s)]
*  beyond funding individual candidates or even ballot measures? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=264.6s)]
*  I mean, the way that you said they spelled this out in the call, this step-by-step hypothetical [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=267.56s)]
*  nightmare scenario, Republicans win statewide offices and key battleground states this year. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=273.62s)]
*  Next year, they change state laws to give legislators control over presidential electors. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=278.58s)]
*  And then in the next presidential election in 2024, those state legislatures declare [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=282.54s)]
*  votes from urban centers to be tainted, and they decide they will overrule the popular [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=287.86s)]
*  vote in their states by sending their own state of electors to Washington. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=292.86s)]
*  I mean, that prospect, if there's a public education component to that, sort of telling [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=295.74s)]
*  people that that's the plan that they are investing against potentially has the impact [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=302.24s)]
*  of inoculating the public against that kind of a scheme. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=309.4s)]
*  I think that's true, and that's true with some constituencies. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=313.88s)]
*  What's interesting is a lot of this money, though, will not go to spread that message. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  So, for instance, in Pennsylvania, there's a $6 million effort that's been announced [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=319.64s)]
*  part of one of these funding groups' efforts to educate people about Doug Mastriano, the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=324.03999999999996s)]
*  Republican governor's trial candidate. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=330.12s)]
*  Most of that advertising campaign, door knocking campaign is going to be about issues like [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=331.8s)]
*  abortion, minimum wage, unions, other issues than democracy, because they have found through [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=336.0s)]
*  their research, these groups, that those are the issues that will move voters. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's really what this is about, moving voters, getting voters to vote who wouldn't [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=346.2s)]
*  otherwise vote, persuading voters, or in the case of Reid Hoffman's group, dissuading [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  Republicans from voting Republican. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=354.36s)]
*  So I think you're right. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=356.88s)]
*  I think there's going to be a lot of education around this. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=357.88s)]
*  But in a lot of cases, it won't be the primary thing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=360.48s)]
*  And I think a lot of voters who are getting messages from these groups won't know the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=363.04s)]
*  underlying idea behind the money being spent, which is to try and protect the 2024 Democratic [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=368.52s)]
*  process. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=374.6s)]
*  Except for the fact that you're letting the cat out of the bag with this excellent reporting, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=375.6s)]
*  which has its own excellent public education component to it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=380.12s)]
*  Michael Scherer, national political reporter for The Washington Post. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=383.04s)]
*  Sir, thank you for joining us. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  Well done. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=387.32s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=388.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7L7SCfzobIc&t=390.24s)]
