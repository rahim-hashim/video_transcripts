# Panicking Trump coming up short for civil fraud penalty; no friends stepping up as deadline nears
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg)
*  First one was big, maybe not insurmountably big. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=0.0s)]
*  With help from the Federal Insurance Company, which is a subsidiary of Chubb Insurance, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=3.48s)]
*  former President Donald Trump managed to post a $91.6 million bond in the defamation case [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=8.76s)]
*  he lost to E. Jean Carroll. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=14.9s)]
*  That bond allows Trump to avoid paying E. Jean Carroll for real while he attempts to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=16.76s)]
*  appeal that judgment against him. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=21.86s)]
*  If he were to lose the appeal and not pay up, the Federal Insurance Company and Chubb [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  would be on the hook to pay Ms. Carroll. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=28.88s)]
*  That has given the company's investors and brokers and some of their customers apparently [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=32.0s)]
*  a little bit of heartburn judging from a letter the CEO of Chubb sent around defending the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  decision saying, quote, as the surety, we don't take sides. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=40.84s)]
*  We are supporting and are part of the justice system plumbing included in this case. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=44.48s)]
*  In other words, we're just that trap thing at the bottom of the sink. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=51.44s)]
*  We are not the stuff that got stuck in it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Don't get mad at us for just doing our jobs. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=57.96s)]
*  But if a $91.6 million bond was a doable one for the former president, a $454 million bond [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=60.84s)]
*  and counting is proving to be another matter entirely. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=68.76s)]
*  Lawyers for Mr. Trump today told a New York appellate court that he can't find a company [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=72.36s)]
*  to help him with a nearly half billion dollar bond while he appeals the New York civil fraud [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=77.2s)]
*  case involving his business. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  According to the filing, more than two dozen companies, including Chubb, have decided on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=85.96s)]
*  that bond that they cannot do it and they will not do it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  That leaves Trump in a very vulnerable position for somebody who brags about his personal [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=93.63999999999999s)]
*  wealth as much as he does, who's key to his political appeal is that he can't be bought [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=98.63999999999999s)]
*  because he has so much money than everybody else. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=104.28s)]
*  In this case, what he has more than anybody else is a need for money quickly and desperately. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=106.86s)]
*  New York Attorney General Tish James has said that she is ready and willing to start seizing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=113.24s)]
*  Trump's properties in order to satisfy the judgment. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=118.08s)]
*  The clock is ticking. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=121.08s)]
*  The former president may have to put up more than the half billion dollar bond that's giving [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=122.08s)]
*  him trouble already. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=126.17999999999999s)]
*  As the New York Times puts it today, quote, Trump might have to post an appeal bond worth [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  more, possibly above a half billion dollars to reflect the interest he'll owe in order [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  to prevent Ms. James from seizing his assets on March 25th. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=136.4s)]
*  I mean, March 25th this year, as in one week from tonight. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=142.84s)]
*  Joining us now, Suzanne Craig, Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter for the New [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=149.12s)]
*  York Times. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=152.04s)]
*  Sue, it's really good to have you here in person. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=153.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=154.04s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=155.04s)]
*  You too. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=156.04s)]
*  We have seen Mr. Trump put up one bond already and now we are seeing him saying he can't [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=157.04s)]
*  put up the second one. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  Did we learn anything from the circumstances around which he put up that first bond that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=163.36s)]
*  tell us if he's getting help, that tell us how many of his assets have been tapped already, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=170.88s)]
*  that tell us whether or not he really might be having trouble with the second one? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=177.45999999999998s)]
*  What really came into focus for me today when I was reading this was that there's been a [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=181.44s)]
*  lot of speculation he's going to put up a building. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=186.27999999999997s)]
*  What are they going to accept for this appeal bond? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=189.76s)]
*  I think we're all learning a lot about appeal bonds as we go. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=191.48s)]
*  What we really saw today was that they want hard cash. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  They are not accepting assets. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=197.72s)]
*  Alan Garten, who's a senior officer, is a lawyer at the Trump Organization. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=200.12s)]
*  He said that they tried and with Chubb in particular, none of them wanted real estate. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=204.28s)]
*  These aren't real estate companies. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=209.32s)]
*  They want things they can liquidate immediately. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=210.48s)]
*  They want cash. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=212.72s)]
*  They talked to Chubb about doing this larger one that he's facing a week from today and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=214.2s)]
*  Chubb last week backed away and they're not going to take real estate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=218.8s)]
*  So now we know for certain that he needs to come up with cash and he does not have enough [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=222.56s)]
*  cash according to the filings today. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=227.24s)]
*  So can he, what are his options? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=229.96s)]
*  Can he sell things that he currently owns, liquidate assets, liquidate real estate assets [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=232.56s)]
*  or other assets in order to convert them into cash since that's the only thing he can pay [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=237.96s)]
*  with here? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=241.8s)]
*  That's it and it's going to have to be today, like soon. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=242.8s)]
*  He's going to have to figure. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=246.84s)]
*  And he may have, we don't know, he may be already in the process of potentially negotiating [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=247.84s)]
*  a sale. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=252.56s)]
*  He may have gotten a deal with somebody that he knows. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=253.56s)]
*  And we don't know if that's in progress or not. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=256.20000000000005s)]
*  These are just sort of things that I'm speculating on. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=259.32000000000005s)]
*  It's important to say that, but that could be going on. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=261.36s)]
*  But what we do know is that the filing today was sort of, you know, they're raising their [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=265.64000000000004s)]
*  hands saying they don't have the cash to meet this. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=270.04s)]
*  So they want it stayed. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=273.42s)]
*  And I think the other thing that's really important here is this is a legal maneuver [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  because they're asking a judge to set this aside and if it's rejected, they may go to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=278.92s)]
*  the appellate court. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=285.24s)]
*  So they may buy themselves some times. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=286.24s)]
*  And the attorney general also has the option of saying you can have another 30 days. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=287.76s)]
*  If they were to come and say, we have a plan, there may, there's a lot of things. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=291.68s)]
*  We just never have seen anything like this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  So I just, there's a lot of things that could happen. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=298.48s)]
*  But right now he is looking down the barrel of a gun. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=301.36s)]
*  I mean, you can hear the clock. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=305.08s)]
*  He has got one week. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=306.32s)]
*  And if nothing changes, the attorney general of New York can come in and start to seize [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=308.08s)]
*  the pass. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=313.76s)]
*  Cease his building, seize his material. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=315.32s)]
*  So the thing that I am worried about now that I didn't think I would be worried about when [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=316.96s)]
*  this whole process started is that I'm worried that he is in such a crunch. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=322.32s)]
*  And I'm worried what that means in terms of a national security threat for the United [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  States. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  Is there anything about the process of putting up bonds that prevents some angel from coming [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=330.8s)]
*  in and paying it for him? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  And if that happened, would we know? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=339.9s)]
*  Well, that can happen. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=342.88s)]
*  And if that happens, there's going to be tax consequences for the person who gives it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=343.88s)]
*  Because it's a gift? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=347.64s)]
*  It's a taxable event. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=349.52s)]
*  And I've sort of been wondering how much transparency are we going to have in it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=352.28s)]
*  We do know with the E. Jean Carroll case, the bond was posted and he posted his collateral [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=355.6s)]
*  and some filings, a brokerage account that he has that has liquid securities in it. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=360.2s)]
*  So there's some visibility. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=366.84s)]
*  And keep in mind, there's also a monitor over the company that is going to be watching this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  So I suspect at the end we're going to know. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=372.68s)]
*  I never want to say never with anything. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=375.12s)]
*  But right now, I feel like we should know at least who comes forward with it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=377.44s)]
*  But that's another possibility is someone could come up with the money and write a check [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=381.8s)]
*  to cover it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=386.24s)]
*  He also has other wealthy family members, Ivanka Trump and her husband come to mind. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=387.24s)]
*  So there's still, I think, a range of possibilities. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=392.56s)]
*  And they're exploring them all, I can guarantee it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=396.2s)]
*  They have to be. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=398.24s)]
*  So I think that next week, I think we're just going to have a lot more visibility and know [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=399.72s)]
*  exactly how this is going to be dealt with. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=402.8s)]
*  But we could be faced in a week with a situation where the attorney general says the day has [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=404.52s)]
*  come and I'm going to appeal to the court when we're going to move forward to seize [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  the assets. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=413.24s)]
*  He recently changed his position on the culture war issue around Bud Light after Anheuser [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=414.24s)]
*  Bush did a fundraiser for him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=419.56s)]
*  He then changed his position on TikTok and the Chinese government after he met with a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=421.56s)]
*  guy who has a big financial stake in TikTok. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=425.24s)]
*  He now needs a half billion dollars right now. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=427.92s)]
*  He has to pay it on Monday. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=430.44s)]
*  And so I'm just worried about what's for sale. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeBykSLgGFg&t=431.56s)]
