# Trump appears overwhelmed as opposition grows and support withers
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ)
*  But there have now been so many thousands of protests involving so many millions of Americans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Now I think it's time to start having a national conversation of a different type, right? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=8.4s)]
*  The strategy and the character of the opposition to Trump is not only [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=12.8s)]
*  self-evident as the most important story in the country, I think it's finally being recognized [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=18.48s)]
*  as the most important story in the country, which is nice. And, you know, you have the president [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=22.56s)]
*  clearly just fundamentally politically unable to contend with the depth and breadth of feeling [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=30.16s)]
*  against him, right? So these must be paid protesters or invaders from somewhere else, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=35.84s)]
*  or they must all be violent criminals or whatever. No, actually this is St. Louis, right? This is [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  this is America. No kings. Yes, queens. Right? Like this is just us. It's who we are and this is how [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=47.68s)]
*  we feel about you. I mean, this is Joplin, Missouri. This is Louisville, Kentucky, where [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=55.6s)]
*  thousands of people turned out. This is McHenry, Illinois. This is High Point, North Carolina. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=61.36s)]
*  It is literally everywhere in this country. Americans in surprising numbers, in surprising [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=66.8s)]
*  places turning out again and again and again and again to say, no, nope, we are not doing this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=72.56s)]
*  You are not taking over our country and turning us into a dictatorship. You are not going to be [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=79.04s)]
*  king here. And so with all that proof in the pudding, right, with all of that evidence of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  where we are, it's now sort of time, if we haven't had it already, it is now time to really have a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=94.64s)]
*  serious national conversation about where this all goes. Because this is not the just like the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=100.32s)]
*  resistance to Trump, right? Like this is the opposition to Trump. This is the other side. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=107.6s)]
*  And if we're thinking about the two sides of this fight, well, politically, we're at a point where [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=112.08s)]
*  Trump, and I don't mean this in a mean way, but as a political figure, he looks sad and small. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=119.52s)]
*  Right? Nobody came to his $45 million military birthday party. He is a laughing stock on the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=126.8s)]
*  world stage. He's being treated at the G7 right now like he's Putin's intern. The White House just [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=133.36s)]
*  announced tonight that Trump is coming home early from the G7 meeting tonight after so embarrassing [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  himself there today. I mean, this is a president whose signature economic policy, his supposed [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  tariff policy is a punchline even among Republicans. I mean, some someday 30 years from now, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  the whole lecture hall full of econ 101 students is going to laugh out loud when the professor gets [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  out the chalk and writes taco on the chalkboard and has to explain what the acronym taco meant [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=161.28s)]
*  in the Trump years for his signature economic policy that he thought would work so well for him [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=166.4s)]
*  both politically and economically. It is a punchline. I mean, this is a president who [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=172.0s)]
*  appointed a madman to be the nation's health secretary and who in turn he has just put like [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=177.76s)]
*  a Q and on conspiracy chat room in charge of the nation's vaccine schedule. This is a president [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  who is selling coins and gold trinkets with his face on them from the White House. This is a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=188.72s)]
*  president who can't persuade the first lady to live with him. This is a president whose supposed [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=195.12s)]
*  best friend says he should be impeached. And by the way, he's in the Epstein files. I mean, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=202.32s)]
*  this is a president whose approval ratings are more underwater than any other president ever at [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=207.44s)]
*  this point in his term. He has already rushed right to the part where he tries to turn the military [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=212.24s)]
*  against the civilian population, where he tries to turn the force of the American military [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=218.72s)]
*  against the American people. And that is something that neither the military nor the people have an [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=223.52s)]
*  appetite for. And he is going to learn that soon enough. He has rushed right to the end because he [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=228.24s)]
*  has no idea how to play cards against opposition to him that is this big, this sustainable, this [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=233.68s)]
*  broad and this correct. He hasn't done anything as president that would win anyone over to his side. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=243.44s)]
*  And the number of people who voted for him or supported him otherwise, who are now regretting it, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=250.24s)]
*  grows by the day. And they don't just grow privately, they grow in the headlines every day. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=255.36s)]
*  Everybody against him is getting stronger and more confident. Everybody with him is starting to get a [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=261.68s)]
*  little worried about how long they can stay with him as they see their numbers dwindle and they see [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=269.04s)]
*  him fail and flail over and over and over again. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=273.76s)]
*  So for a would-be strong man, he's not strong. He is a remarkably weak and feckless political figure [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  who is nevertheless trying to overthrow the American form of government while pushing [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=292.16s)]
*  incredibly unpopular policies and executing everything incredibly poorly with a laughing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=296.72s)]
*  stock full of a terribly, terribly staffed administration and cabinet. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=302.72s)]
*  I mean, who's in the Trump administration who you think like, skills, right? Or you think, popular. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  Or you think, growing political capital for this president by the day, honestly. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=318.24s)]
*  And on the other side, the opposition against him is big, deep, growing, confident, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  and increasingly unstoppable. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdFCGXNXtZQ&t=332.72s)]
