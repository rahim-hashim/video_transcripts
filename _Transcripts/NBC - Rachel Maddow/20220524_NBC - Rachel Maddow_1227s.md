# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: May 23
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I)
*  Here's a little quiz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=0.0s)]
*  Can you identify these three gentlemen? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=3.42s)]
*  If your idea of a fun party is identifying recent, lesser-known government officials, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=5.04s)]
*  then this is a fun party, right? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  You got it? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=10.48s)]
*  Know who these guys are? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=11.48s)]
*  Yes, they are all former U.S. Treasury secretaries. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=12.72s)]
*  One Treasury secretary from the George W. Bush years and the other two are from the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=16.6s)]
*  Obama years. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=19.64s)]
*  If you got that, congratulations. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=21.48s)]
*  You're going to kill it at your next pub quiz trivia night, right? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=22.48s)]
*  Of course, one of the things that Treasury secretaries do is they have to travel around [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=27.52s)]
*  the world to discuss financial stuff. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=30.68s)]
*  Occasionally, for example, they have to travel to the Middle East, to the Persian Gulf countries, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=32.48s)]
*  to talk oil prices or to encourage investment in the United States or whatever. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=36.64s)]
*  These are all photos of those three Treasury secretaries visiting the Persian Gulf states. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=42.26s)]
*  But there aren't all that many photos of them because there weren't all that many of those [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=47.04s)]
*  trips. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Those three guys, over the space of a decade, over two different administrations, all three [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  of them together visited the Persian Gulf states eight times, eight times in total between [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=55.0s)]
*  all of them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=61.44s)]
*  Now, how about this guy? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=62.44s)]
*  You recognize him? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=63.96s)]
*  A little more recent. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  Guy who held the same job, Donald Trump's Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=67.2s)]
*  During Trump's one term, during the four years he was Treasury secretary, you know how many [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=70.98s)]
*  times he went to the Gulf states? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=75.12s)]
*  At least 18. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=77.64s)]
*  The last three guys went eight times in total between them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=80.72s)]
*  Mnuchin went 18 times just himself. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=84.48s)]
*  That's a 12-hour transatlantic flight to visit his friends in the Gulf, probably more often [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=87.2s)]
*  than you visited your friends who live across town. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=92.2s)]
*  I mean, his three predecessors, eight times combined over a decade. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=94.48s)]
*  Mnuchin, 18 times in four years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=99.36s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=102.4s)]
*  Well new reporting from the New York Times suggests one answer to that question. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=104.2s)]
*  Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin was visiting Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=107.72s)]
*  Qatar and Kuwait to scare up new investments. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=111.72s)]
*  For himself, not for the United States, which is a thing that's called self-dealing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=115.7s)]
*  And it's a thing that we're not supposed to do. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=120.88s)]
*  Last month, the New York Times reported on truly remarkable sums of cash that the various [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=123.84s)]
*  Gulf monarchies had invested in private projects being run by Steven Mnuchin, as well as projects [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=128.4s)]
*  for Trump's son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=134.72s)]
*  And the monarchies started paying out these funds almost as soon as those guys left the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=138.32s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=142.6s)]
*  Last year, after Trump was out of office, the Saudis gave Steven Mnuchin a billion dollars [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=144.0s)]
*  for his new investment fund. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  They gave Jared Kushner two billion dollars. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  And they did this even though Saudi Arabia's own investment advisers explicitly recommended [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=154.24s)]
*  against it in writing because they determined that Kushner had no experience, he had no [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  other investors. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=163.82s)]
*  Their due diligence on Kushner's operation showed that they are, quote, unsatisfactory [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  in all aspects. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=169.38s)]
*  But still, the Saudis gave two billion dollars to Jared. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=177.14s)]
*  Well, his father-in-law's administration had bent over backwards for four years to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=178.73999999999998s)]
*  try to protect Saudi interests, starting with making Saudi Arabia Trump's very first foreign [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=183.42s)]
*  trip as president, something no president had ever done and no other president ever will. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=188.04s)]
*  Donald Trump and Kushner and Steven Mnuchin defended the Saudis' autocratic de facto ruler [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=193.9s)]
*  after he rounded up and imprisoned hundreds of royal family members, after he started [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=199.68s)]
*  a blockade of the US ally in Qatar, after he signed off on an operation to kidnap and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=203.9s)]
*  ultimately murder and dismember a Washington Post journalist. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=208.96s)]
*  All that favor and protection over the course of four years has got to be worth something, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=218.18s)]
*  A couple billion dollars at least, especially if Donald Trump might be president again one [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=219.18s)]
*  day. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=223.02s)]
*  So there's this sort of implicit quid pro quo in that situation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=224.86s)]
*  Hey, remember how good you were when you were in office? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, how about remember how good our administration was to you when I was in office? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=231.58s)]
*  Well, now how about you put some money in my pocket? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=235.94s)]
*  How about you invest in my new project? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=238.5s)]
*  That quid pro quo with Kushner in particular is icky enough, but this new reporting from [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  The Times suggests that Kushner and Mnuchin may have actively been using their government [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=245.74s)]
*  positions to tee up these money making enterprises for themselves once they left office. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=249.9s)]
*  Right before the 2020 election, Kushner and Mnuchin unveiled a new US government backed [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  investment fund that would extensively raise billions of dollars for projects in the Middle [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=260.34000000000003s)]
*  East. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=264.42s)]
*  All through the end of the Trump presidency, Kushner and Mnuchin kept flying all over the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=265.62s)]
*  Middle East on the taxpayers dime, trying to raise money for the supposed government [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=269.26s)]
*  fund. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=273.38s)]
*  Jared made three trips to the Middle East just in the weeks between the election and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=274.38s)]
*  the inauguration of Joe Biden. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=278.98s)]
*  And when the January 6th attack happened, he was on his way back from Saudi Arabia and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=280.7s)]
*  Stephen Mnuchin was on his way to Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=284.78s)]
*  Mnuchin ultimately cut his trip short because of the capital attack, but he did stretch [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=288.42s)]
*  it out still just a couple more days to try to squeeze in one more meeting with the leader [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=292.14s)]
*  of Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=295.94s)]
*  Here's the thing, though. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=298.54s)]
*  All those meetings were supposedly about this US government backed investment fund. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=299.65999999999997s)]
*  The Times describes it as, quote, little more than talk with no accounts, no employees, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=304.5s)]
*  no income and no projects. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=308.94s)]
*  The fund vanished when Mr. Trump left office. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=310.3s)]
*  Except Kushner and Mnuchin did later raise billions from all those countries they were [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=314.54s)]
*  scrambling to visit in their last months in government. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=319.42s)]
*  They just didn't raise it for any US government fund, which appears to have never really existed. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=321.78s)]
*  They raised it for themselves. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=326.98s)]
*  Just three weeks after leaving office, Mnuchin was talking about a plan he had. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=329.58s)]
*  A few weeks later, he had detailed investment plans on a half billion dollars from the Emiratis, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=333.70000000000005s)]
*  the Kuwaitis and the Qataris. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=338.58000000000004s)]
*  A half billion dollars from each of them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=341.3s)]
*  All these folks he had just been fundraising from as Treasury Secretary. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=343.22s)]
*  Then came the billions from Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=346.66s)]
*  Mnuchin and Kushner both took the government officials who had extensively been working [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=348.46000000000004s)]
*  with them on this government project and installed them at their new private ventures where they [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=352.32000000000005s)]
*  would get the money. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=357.18s)]
*  In April of last year, when Mnuchin sent the Saudis a roster of the top executives at his [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=359.42s)]
*  new private venture for them to invest in, one of the managing directors was still, at [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=363.66s)]
*  that moment, employed by the US Treasury Department. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=368.18s)]
*  I mean, this isn't even like speeding up the revolving door between government and the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=370.7s)]
*  private sector. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=375.42s)]
*  This is like, there's no door. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=376.42s)]
*  It means you go to work for the US government and in the name of the US government, you [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=378.14s)]
*  raise money for yourself. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=383.54s)]
*  On the one hand, it feels like another bit of corrupt detritus from the Trump administration [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=387.46s)]
*  that has stuck to our collective national shoe. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=392.73999999999995s)]
*  On the other hand, this feels like something so blatant it cannot possibly stand. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=395.46s)]
*  Can it? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=401.78s)]
*  Joining us now is one of the reporters who broke this story, New York Times correspondent [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=402.78s)]
*  Kate Kelly. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=412.29999999999995s)]
*  Ms. Kelly, thank you very much for being here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=413.29999999999995s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=415.79999999999995s)]
*  Pleasure to join you. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  What is the connection between the meetings that Mr. Kushner and Mr. Mnuchin took as government [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=418.86s)]
*  officials and the later investment that was made by government officials in these foreign [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=423.06s)]
*  countries you've described to make these massive investments in private ventures for both of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=428.56s)]
*  those men? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=433.32s)]
*  Well, at a minimum, Rachel, I think those business meetings built the relationships [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=434.32s)]
*  and kept them warm at a time when both Kushner and Mnuchin were a mere weeks away or just [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=439.82s)]
*  a couple of months away from leaving office as Trump stepped down. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  So they got to know their foreign counterparts. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=449.32s)]
*  In Kushner's case, these were rulers of countries. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=452.76s)]
*  These were other senior officials, but also, importantly, the heads of sovereign wealth [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=456.16s)]
*  funds or the large government investment funds run by many countries and notably in the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  Persian Gulf. In Mnuchin's case, and you pointed this out in your intro, these 18 country [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=465.76s)]
*  visits over four years, which had a huge cluster toward the end of the administration, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=470.84s)]
*  actually in January of 21, helped him get acquainted with these major, major investors [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=475.64s)]
*  who just near months later would invest in his funds. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  Now, we also know that this Abraham Fund, you mentioned this three billion dollar, or at [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=484.32s)]
*  least that was the goal, U.S. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=488.35999999999996s)]
*  government-backed fund that was meant to fund development projects in places like [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=490.12s)]
*  Palestine, where Israeli checkpoints would be improved and modernized, among other things. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=495.44s)]
*  That was something that was on both of those officials' item agenda as they toured the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=501.84s)]
*  Gulf in those final months of office to talk about building enthusiasm and support for [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=507.2s)]
*  the fund. But as you noted, it didn't really go anywhere. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=512.0s)]
*  What did go somewhere right after government was Jared Kushner's private equity fund, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=515.24s)]
*  Affinity Partners and Stephen Mnuchin's private equity fund, Liberty Strategic Capital. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=519.92s)]
*  I described this as self-dealing, because as somebody who's not an expert in this, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=524.84s)]
*  somebody just a lay observer, this seems like kind of the dictionary definition of somebody [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=530.52s)]
*  using their public position, their access to government resources, potentially even [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=535.2s)]
*  their actions as government officials to set themselves up for private gain. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=540.48s)]
*  Is that fair in terms of the layman's understanding of that? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=545.2800000000001s)]
*  And as an extension of that, is this potentially illegal behavior? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=548.64s)]
*  Well, that was obviously one of the top questions we were asking ourselves, Rachel, as David [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=555.32s)]
*  Kirkpatrick and I reported on this. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=559.2800000000001s)]
*  And what we discovered from talking to ethics experts is this is quite legal. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=561.36s)]
*  If we as Americans want to see this kind of activity ceased in the future, we need to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=566.6s)]
*  probably codify some some new rules and regulations that prevent one from seeking outside [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=572.2s)]
*  investments from former government counterparts once they leave office, in this case, the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=578.76s)]
*  executive branch. But right now, this is quite legal. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=582.72s)]
*  Self-dealing is a little bit more of a term of art. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  But but sure, I mean, depending on your perspective, I think that that is something you could [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=589.2s)]
*  say. There are laws that govern your participation as a government official in matters [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=593.6800000000001s)]
*  that substantially or personally affect your financial position or that of your immediate [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=599.72s)]
*  family. I'm sure you're familiar with those. I believe it's 18 USC 208. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  But in this case, while not impossible, while I did speak to some ethics experts and some [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=609.52s)]
*  lawyers who thought this could theoretically be applied here, it's very hard because what [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=613.32s)]
*  you really need to establish is a quid pro quo. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  So both parties, in this case, a sovereign wealth fund and these officials would have to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=621.72s)]
*  know there was sort of a two part transaction going on that resulted in them receiving [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=626.24s)]
*  this money. And I think I don't know that that's the case. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=632.52s)]
*  I wouldn't want to suggest that it was. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=635.4s)]
*  But in any case, even if it were very hard to demonstrate for a prosecutor. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=637.8s)]
*  Right. Certainly to prove it in court, of course. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=642.28s)]
*  Kate Kelly, New York Times correspondent with this groundbreaking reporting, thank you for [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=646.24s)]
*  helping us understand it. I appreciate your time. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=649.76s)]

*  This is how he told his colleagues, he said, quote, For 20 years on my diplomatic career, I [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=677.72s)]
*  have seen different turns of our foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=681.6800000000001s)]

*  serious crime against the people of Russia. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=700.4399999999999s)]
*  Those who conceive this war want only one thing to remain in power forever, to live in pompous, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=703.08s)]
*  tasteless palaces, to sail on yachts comparable in tonnage and cost to the entire Russian Navy, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=708.68s)]
*  enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=714.6s)]
*  To achieve that, they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=717.84s)]
*  Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=721.72s)]
*  He goes on to say, quote, I studied to be a diplomat and have been a diplomat for 20 years. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=727.44s)]
*  The foreign ministry has become my home and my family, but I simply cannot any longer share in [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=732.0s)]
*  this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=736.12s)]
*  The diplomat's name is Boris Bondarev. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=743.64s)]
*  His statement also took a direct shot at his boss, Russia's longtime foreign minister, which, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  again, is their equivalent of our secretary of state. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=752.2s)]
*  He says of their foreign minister that he, quote, went from a professional and educated [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=754.9200000000001s)]
*  intellectual, whom many of my colleagues held in such high esteem, to a person who constantly [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=760.0s)]
*  broadcasts conflicting statements and who threatens the world with nuclear weapons. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=764.64s)]
*  And this resignation is fascinating. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  That final point is very provocative, right? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=772.96s)]
*  This guy who has just quit the highest profile diplomatic resignation since Russia started this [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=775.24s)]
*  war, he's a nuclear nonproliferation expert. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=780.0s)]
*  After he quit today, he told The New York Times he was disturbed by the nonchalance with [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=783.5600000000001s)]
*  which some of his fellow Russian diplomats chatted about possible nuclear strikes against the West. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=789.0s)]
*  That is also a thing that is apparently increasingly happening on state controlled Russian TV. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  Mr. Bondarev said of that talk, quote, They think that if you hit some village in America with a [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=800.04s)]
*  nuclear strike, then the Americans will immediately get scared and run to beg for mercy on their knees. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=804.6s)]
*  Quote, That's how many of our people think. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=811.16s)]
*  And I fear that this is the line that they are passing along to Moscow. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=813.48s)]
*  Joining us now is Julia Davis. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=818.4s)]

*  Ms. Davis, I really appreciate you making time to be here tonight. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=826.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=828.08s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=829.6s)]
*  It's my pleasure. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=830.72s)]
*  Mr. Bondarev today raised this issue in his resignation letter and then in follow up interviews, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=831.44s)]
*  including with The New York Times, saying the nonchalance and the frequency of discussion about [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=837.6800000000001s)]
*  what a good idea it would be to use nuclear weapons. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=842.48s)]
*  He, as a longtime diplomat, as an expert in the field, finds unnerving. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=845.24s)]
*  I have to ask in your monitoring of Russian state television if you're seeing what he's describing. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=849.4000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=855.5200000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=856.8s)]
*  And it's so refreshing to hear someone who's an insider like him to address it because it's [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=857.64s)]
*  become redundant. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=863.44s)]
*  Every single day they bring up the idea of nuclear strikes against Ukraine or against the West. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=865.48s)]
*  And it's a nonstop chatter that has been basically normalized at this point. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=872.12s)]
*  If you could ever normalize anything as abnormal, they've become a larger, more dangerous North [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=877.44s)]
*  Korea in their rhetoric. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=884.2s)]
*  And this has changed, to be clear. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=886.8s)]
*  This isn't a constant. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=888.52s)]
*  This is something that's changed and become more frequent over the course of this war over these [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=889.44s)]
*  last three months. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=893.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=895.32s)]
*  They followed Putin's lead when he said if anyone dares to interfere in what's going on in Ukraine, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=896.04s)]
*  they will be met with such retaliatory action that they have never contemplated or have seen before. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=903.48s)]
*  And on state television, they are repeatedly reiterating that what he meant was a nuclear [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=910.76s)]
*  strike. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=917.1199999999999s)]
*  And they repeat that with a great sense of pride that that is one thing that they know the West [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=917.92s)]
*  fears. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=923.28s)]
*  So they like to constantly repeat it and convince the Russians or attempt to convince them that even [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=923.68s)]
*  if they have to die for the motherland, there's no better way to go. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=930.64s)]
*  From your monitoring of this type of propaganda, the state-controlled television in Russia, do you [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=934.12s)]
*  feel like that should make the West, that should make the American government, that should make us [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=940.28s)]
*  as people observing this, more fearful about the prospect that Putin might choose to use nuclear [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=946.36s)]
*  weapons in either in some tactical way or in some strategic way? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=952.76s)]
*  Do you feel like the saber rattling that you're seeing there should be more of a threat to the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=957.32s)]
*  American people? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=963.24s)]
*  Do you think that the saber rattling that you're seeing there should make us feel like this is a [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=964.2s)]
*  more acute threat? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=969.32s)]
*  Or do you think this is just a sort of generic sign of belligerence and chest pounding that might not [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=970.5200000000001s)]
*  translate directly into a nuclear worry? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=976.5200000000001s)]
*  We should remain clear-eyed about Russia's capabilities, but at the same time, keep in mind [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=981.1600000000001s)]
*  that they are saying it for us to be afraid for the West to stop helping Ukraine. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=985.96s)]
*  It's the only thing that they could threaten us with. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=992.12s)]
*  They can't threaten us economically. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=994.84s)]
*  There's not much they can do to us, basically. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=996.92s)]
*  So that is one weapon at their disposal that they like to saber-rattle with. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=999.16s)]
*  And their motive is to make us fear them. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1005.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's exactly what they're hoping to do. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1010.12s)]
*  And that should be the opposite of what we do. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1012.68s)]
*  The Russian government has yet to respond to this resignation from Mr. Bondarev today, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1016.4399999999999s)]
*  at least as far as I know. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1020.52s)]
*  They haven't responded yet. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1021.56s)]
*  What do you expect their reaction to it will be? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1024.04s)]
*  Or do you think they'll just pretend this didn't happen? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1026.52s)]
*  I can safely predict what they will probably do. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1030.2s)]
*  They usually follow the same exact script in these types of instances. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1032.92s)]
*  They will say he's a traitor. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1038.28s)]
*  They will claim that he was offered some sort of a reward by the West and he sold out. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1039.8s)]
*  And this is the way that they will portray him, especially because his letter was so [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1046.2s)]
*  scathing because he referred to Navalny's investigations about Lavrov's extended family, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1050.36s)]
*  taking advantage of Oleg Deripaska's luxury properties and Putin's palaces, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1058.12s)]
*  all of those based on Navalny's investigations. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1065.0s)]
*  So they will certainly try to claim that he is a quote-unquote traitor simply for [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1067.32s)]
*  exposing their corruption and not being willing to put up with their warmongering and [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1074.6799999999998s)]
*  horrific acts of aggression that they have engaged in. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1081.3999999999999s)]
*  Julia Davis is a columnist at The Daily Bee. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1086.12s)]
*  She's creator of Russian Media Monitor. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1088.52s)]
*  Ms. Davis, thanks for making time to be with us tonight. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1090.76s)]
*  It's really helpful to have you here. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1093.32s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1095.24s)]
*  So Thursday last week was the day the January 6th investigation [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1098.4399999999998s)]
*  said, hey, Congressman Lauder-Milk, we'd like to talk to you because you've led a tour on January 5th. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1103.88s)]
*  In response, he released a new statement that, contrary to his earlier denials, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1109.16s)]
*  he now admits he did lead a tour of the Capitol Complex on January 5th. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1113.88s)]
*  He admitted that in print on Thursday. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1118.8400000000001s)]
*  Then on Friday, he released a video saying that he was only being persecuted for giving that tour [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1121.3200000000002s)]
*  that he previously denied. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1126.8400000000001s)]
*  He was only being persecuted for it because the people on the tour were wearing red baseball hats. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1128.28s)]
*  On January 5th, I took a family with young children and their guests who were visiting [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1133.96s)]
*  Washington to lunch in a cafeteria in one of the House Office buildings. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1138.2800000000002s)]
*  So what was so awful about this family that caused the committee to make false accusations about them? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1143.48s)]
*  Well, some were actually wearing red baseball caps. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1149.0800000000002s)]
*  A family with young children and also their guests was the tour that you led on the 5th, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1154.7600000000002s)]
*  and they were wearing red caps, you say. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1160.2800000000002s)]
*  First, he said there were no tours given, and anybody who said there was a tour should be [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1162.04s)]
*  reported to the ethics committee and investigated. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1165.8s)]
*  Then the further detail that if there was a tour, which there wasn't, definitely no one was on such [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1168.28s)]
*  a tour wearing a red MAGA baseball cap. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1173.8s)]
*  Now it turns out, yeah, there was at least the tour led by him, the tour he led of all the people [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1176.6s)]
*  wearing the red caps. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1181.08s)]
*  Congressman Barry Loudermilk got caught out by the investigation on this on Thursday. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1183.6399999999999s)]
*  He copped to it on that video on Friday. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1189.24s)]
*  Then guess what happened on Saturday? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1191.9599999999998s)]
*  Guess what happened next? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1193.3999999999999s)]
*  You probably guessed this too. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1195.24s)]
*  Statement from Donald J. Trump. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1197.56s)]
*  Quote, Barry Loudermilk has my complete and total endorsement. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1199.1599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DJaBjI4d3I&t=1218.84s)]
