# Trump makes show of embracing arrest as his lawyers fight to hide arraignment from press
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE)
*  Handy rule for watching the news. It was true then, it's true now. I think it has eternal value. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=0.0s)]
*  If you're a long time watcher of this show, you will know what the rule is, which is watch what they do, not what they say. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=6.0s)]
*  And in today's news, we have an excellent example of why that rule is important. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=15.0s)]
*  As he approaches his arrest and indictment tomorrow, former President Donald Trump has reportedly told associates [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=21.0s)]
*  that he welcomes the spectacle of what's going to happen tomorrow. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=28.0s)]
*  Specifically, he welcomes the idea of being paraded in front of the cameras for his arraignment. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=32.0s)]
*  He has reportedly described the proceeding as having the potential to be a, quote, fun experience for him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=38.0s)]
*  The New York Times reporting that he has mused aloud about whether or not he should smile for the cameras, smile for his mugshot. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=44.0s)]
*  His allies are also saying this indictment, this arrest is going to be a big boost for him. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=52.0s)]
*  It will be great for his campaign. They can't wait to use the footage in all sorts of politically advantageous ways. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=56.0s)]
*  If you go by what they say, Trump is celebrating his forthcoming arraignment, looking forward to it all being on camera, because that will all be so good for him. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=63.0s)]
*  That's what they've been saying. What are they doing? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=74.0s)]
*  What they're doing is formally arguing to the judge against cameras being allowed in the courtroom for the arraignment. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=78.0s)]
*  Trump's lawyers are also now publicly arguing against Trump having to pose for a mugshot. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=86.0s)]
*  Hey, wait, I thought you were excited about the mugshot. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=92.0s)]
*  I thought you were excited for the cameras showing the arraignment. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=95.0s)]
*  That's what they've been saying, but that's completely opposite to what they're doing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=98.0s)]
*  . [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi5sx-XWMDE&t=108.0s)]
