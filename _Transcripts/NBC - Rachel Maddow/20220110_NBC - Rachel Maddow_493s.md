# Republicans In At Least Three States Filed Forged Elector Letters
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA)
*  In addition to meeting to describe themselves as the electors from the state of Wisconsin, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=0.0s)]
*  even though they weren't, we subsequently learned that this group of Republicans, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=5.28s)]
*  in a state that Biden won, they put pen to paper. They not only declared that day that they were [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=8.88s)]
*  the real electors, and they were electors for Trump, they actually drew up forged documents [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=14.88s)]
*  in which they tried to impersonate real electors. They purported to be the actual electors from the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=21.12s)]
*  state of Wisconsin, and they apparently sent them in to the National Archives and to the Congress, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=26.8s)]
*  as if they were the real electors. So we reported on that last month just before Christmas, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=32.72s)]
*  and on the still live question in Wisconsin as to whether or not any of those 10 Republicans who [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=38.96s)]
*  signed their names to those forged documents, whether they could actually be prosecuted for [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  forgery, for having signed their names to this document, impersonating real electors. It's still [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=49.92s)]
*  an open question in Wisconsin. It's an open question before the state election board, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=56.24s)]
*  potentially before the Milwaukee County District Attorney. So that's what we reported [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=59.84s)]
*  right before Christmas in Wisconsin. But now look at this. Politico reporter Nicholas Wu had the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=66.64s)]
*  really good idea to file public records requests in multiple states, asking to see what officials [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=72.48s)]
*  in those states had handed over to the January 6th investigation. Look at these documents here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=79.92s)]
*  Turns out it wasn't just Wisconsin. On the left side of your screen, these are the similar forged [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  documents from Republicans in Michigan, purporting to be the electors from the state of Michigan, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=94.72s)]
*  casting their votes for Trump, even though Michigan voted for Biden. On the right side of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=100.56s)]
*  your screen, these are newly unearthed forged documents from Republicans in Arizona, again, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=105.44s)]
*  purporting to be the real electors from the state of Arizona, casting their votes for Trump, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=112.0s)]
*  even though in reality, Trump lost Arizona and Biden won. Now in both instances, just like the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=116.72s)]
*  documents we dug up in Wisconsin, in both instances, these really are forgeries. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=123.68s)]
*  If you're a state that Trump lost and Biden won, the electors from your state [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=131.2s)]
*  are electors for Biden. But nevertheless, in both these instances, here's Republicans in Michigan [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=135.76s)]
*  and Arizona pretending to be their state's electors, pretending to be electors for Trump. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=141.04s)]
*  And I can tell you, I mean, based on our previous reporting about what Republicans did with these [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  forgeries in Wisconsin, in Michigan, it looks exactly the same. In these Michigan documents, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=151.92s)]
*  it looks exactly like the forgery we previously reported on from Wisconsin, except it's 16 [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  electoral votes instead of 10, and the names are different. Other than that, it's basically word [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  for word and even matching formatting, matching fonts. Two, the President of the United States [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=166.4s)]
*  Senate and the Archivist of the United States and the Michigan Secretary of State and the Chief Judge [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=172.08s)]
*  of the U.S. District Court in the Western District of Michigan pursuant to three U.S. codes, Section [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=176.4s)]
*  11, enclosed, please find Michigan's electoral votes for President and Vice President. We the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=180.88s)]
*  undersigned, being the duly elected and qualified electors, no you're not, for President and Vice [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  President of the United States of America and the state of Michigan do hereby certify the following [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=194.96s)]
*  that we convened and organized in the state capitol in the city of Lansing and performed the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  duties enjoined upon us. Being so assembled and duly organized, we proceeded to vote by ballot [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=204.24s)]
*  for President Trump, 16 votes, Vice President Pence, 16 votes. They are purporting to be the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  duly elected electors of the state of Michigan. They are not. And then these 16 Republicans from [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=216.24s)]
*  Michigan all signed their name to this forgery as if they really are the Michigan electors. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=223.36s)]
*  And these really are the official results of the election in the state of Michigan. A forged [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=231.36s)]
*  document purporting to represent the real election results in that state. Again, that's Michigan. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=236.0s)]
*  And again, it looks exactly like the document from Wisconsin. In Arizona, interestingly, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=241.60000000000002s)]
*  the formatting is different there. And the Arizona Republic had reported at the time that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  this had happened, that Republicans in Arizona were trying to do something like this. But as far [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=253.28s)]
*  as I know, we'd never actually seen the forged documents themselves before now. But thanks to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=257.28s)]
*  Nicholas Wu's reporting at Politico, here it is. Page one has the official state seal of the state [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=264.32s)]
*  of Arizona. And then that repeats throughout the document. The whole thing oddly has a notary stamp [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=269.68s)]
*  on it. Each of the signatures is notarized. But it's headlined the seating and voting of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=274.96s)]
*  presidential electors for the general election of 2020. The enclosed seating and voting electors [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=280.72s)]
*  documents amend the previously submitted documents. Whatever you've gotten before, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=285.68s)]
*  these are the real ones. And you see the headline here, again, under the actual state seal from [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=290.56s)]
*  Arizona, the certificate of ascertainment of the electors. And then all the rest of the pages [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  are each of those 11 Republicans purporting to be electors, each of them one by one, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=302.56s)]
*  solemnly attesting and signing their names to this document that says they're the real [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=309.28s)]
*  presidential electors from Arizona. And they cast their electoral college votes for Donald Trump and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=313.76s)]
*  Mike Pence, each one of them individually signed and notarized under the official seal of the great [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  state of Arizona. These documents are forgeries. These people are not the real electors, both in [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  Michigan and in Arizona, just like we saw in Wisconsin. The real electors in all these states [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=332.32s)]
*  were Biden-Harris electors because Biden and Harris won those states. But in at least these [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=339.04s)]
*  three states that Biden won, we now know and we can now see the forgeries that Republicans tried [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=343.92s)]
*  to pass off as real electoral certifications. So their fake votes could somehow be counted in the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=350.0s)]
*  electoral college instead of the real ones. And again, crucially, this was not just play acting. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=356.88s)]
*  They were not apparently just drawing these things up to have like a little [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=364.8s)]
*  bureaucratic Christmas pageant in 2020 where they could pretend Trump really won and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=369.2s)]
*  wouldn't that be fun to play dress up and act it out? I mean, they actually sent these forged [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=373.44s)]
*  documents into the government purporting to be real. They sent them to the Congress. They sent [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=379.2s)]
*  them to the National Archives. Nicholas Wu reports today at politico.com that part of the reason we [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=384.56s)]
*  know that is that the National Archives last December forwarded the Arizona forgeries to the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=390.16s)]
*  Secretary of State in Arizona, quote, for your awareness. The National Archives making clear [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  they were not planning to act on these forged documents, but the Secretary of State should know [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  they exist. The Secretary of State in Arizona, Katie Hopps, responded, at least in part, by [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=407.12s)]
*  sending a cease and desist letter to the Republican fake electors, telling them they at least really [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  truly needed to stop using the official state seal. Now, interestingly, we don't know what ultimately [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=419.68s)]
*  became of the forged documents that were drawn up by the Republicans in Michigan. We don't know of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=426.24s)]
*  any response to them, for example, from the National Archives. We also don't know if they're facing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=430.64s)]
*  calls for their prosecution the way their neighboring Republicans are in Wisconsin right next door, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=435.52s)]
*  where they tried the exact same stunt, apparently using the exact same language, the exact same font [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=440.48s)]
*  and formatting. How come these forged documents look exactly the same between your two states? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=446.24s)]
*  Was somebody organizing this forgery effort among Republicans in multiple states to send in [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=452.64s)]
*  false slates of electors as if they were real? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=458.0s)]
*  Because now we've got a hold of the forged documents they created in not one, not two, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=462.88s)]
*  but three different states. Who believes we'll find more where this came from? Raise your hand. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq1HGGLWdEA&t=476.24s)]
