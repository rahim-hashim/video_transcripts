# Children put at risk in Donald Trump's petty vendetta against the state of Maine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE)
*  So, by day 73 of this administration, the Trump administration, you know, the twin themes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=0.0s)]
*  of retribution and chaos have become the new normal. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=6.4s)]
*  But there are still some actions that are so petty and so vindictive that they actually [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=10.08s)]
*  manage to stand out in all of this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  For example, just about a month ago, the Social Security administration did something incredibly [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=17.92s)]
*  strange. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=22.8s)]
*  All of a sudden, out of the blue, the agency stopped letting new parents in the state of [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=23.8s)]
*  Maine get Social Security numbers for their kids at the hospital. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=28.56s)]
*  They also stopped letting funeral homes file death records electronically. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=34.48s)]
*  Everything would now have to be done in person at a Social Security office in that state. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=39.44s)]
*  Again, this was all done just in one state, the state of Maine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=45.44s)]
*  And of course, the changes, as you know, would cost more. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  It would certainly take a little bit more time. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=53.08s)]
*  And it meant that the parents of newborn babies who are already dealing with lots of important [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=55.56s)]
*  things by bringing a new life into this world, well, they would have to now risk getting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  sick by going in person to crowded Social Security offices and possibly spending hours [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=65.88s)]
*  in line to get their paperwork. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=71.18s)]
*  The question is, why did the Social Security department make that change? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  Why did it only apply to the state of Maine out of all the states? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, it turns out that it may have been because of this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, back in February, Trump signed an executive order aimed at banning trans athletes from [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=105.88s)]
*  competing in school sports. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=110.6s)]
*  The governor of Maine, Janet Mills, who you saw in that clip, she refused to comply, saying [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=112.6s)]
*  that was an issue for Maine's state legislator to decide, not the president of the United [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=117.28s)]
*  States. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  And you know what happened. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  Trump was furious. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  You better do it because you're not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=128.04s)]
*  And by the way, your population, even though it's somewhat liberal, although I did very [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=131.4s)]
*  well there, your population doesn't want men playing in women's sports. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=134.76s)]
*  So you better comply because otherwise you're not getting any federal funding. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=139.76s)]
*  Every state, good, I'll see you in court. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  I look forward to that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=147.12s)]
*  That should be a real easy one. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=148.12s)]
*  So now Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are alleging that that clash that you just [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=150.84s)]
*  saw there, that threat by Trump and Maine's Democratic governor, Janet Mills, is the reason [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=154.88s)]
*  that Maine was singled out by Social Security. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  Emails obtained by the committee show that just a week after Trump's clash with Mills, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=164.84s)]
*  the acting commissioner of Social Security, Lee Dudek, directed his staff to cancel the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  contracts that allowed Maine to process Social Security number and death records electronically, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  writing, quote, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=180.83999999999997s)]
*  Now, because of public outcry, the changes to Social Security in Maine only ended up [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=186.0s)]
*  lasting about two days before the agency reversed course. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  But amazingly, the acting commissioner of Social Security, Lee Dudek, has now been shy, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=196.36s)]
*  has not been shy, I should say, about how the original changes were actually meant to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=202.4s)]
*  be that, retribution. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  In fact, he told the New York Times, quote, I was ticked at the governor of Maine for [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=208.12s)]
*  not being real cordial to the president. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=212.96s)]
*  Obviously, making social services worse for citizens of one state as political retribution [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=216.96s)]
*  is a huge scandal on its own. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  And it should be a huge scandal. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  Multiple members of Congress are already calling for the acting commissioner to resign over [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=227.72s)]
*  this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=232.04s)]
*  But the open question here is, did he actually freelance this retribution? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=233.04s)]
*  Did Dudek do this on his own, or was anyone above him at the White House involved in this [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=238.2s)]
*  action against the state of Maine? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=244.56s)]
*  Joining us now is Representative Shelley Pingree of Maine, one of the members of Congress [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=247.12s)]
*  calling for the acting commissioner to resign. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=251.68s)]
*  Representative Pingree, thank you so much for being with us tonight. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=255.76s)]
*  So quite a shocking development. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=258.48s)]
*  And before we get to that, I do want to start, though, with some news out of the Department [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=259.96s)]
*  of Agriculture, which announced that it was actually freezing some of the funding it provides [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=264.0s)]
*  to schools in Maine in response to alleged Title IX violations about trans athletes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=268.12s)]
*  The department claimed that it was only freezing administrative funding and not touching funds [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=274.36s)]
*  for child nutrition. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=279.48s)]
*  I understand your office actually has some news on that front this evening. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=281.04s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=285.32s)]
*  Well, first, thanks so much for having me and thanks for highlighting this issue, what [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=286.32s)]
*  crazy times we're living through. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=291.04s)]
*  So this retribution continues to our state. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=293.04s)]
*  We're being singled out, but it's just like so many other things that Trump is doing. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=295.68s)]
*  We've learned tonight that even though the secretary of agriculture said that no child [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=299.96s)]
*  will go unfed, that if a child was fed today, they'll be fed tomorrow, but now they have [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=306.0s)]
*  fired all the personnel who administer these programs. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=310.44s)]
*  School lunch, school breakfast, the snacks. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=314.44s)]
*  So great that the money will be there. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=316.68s)]
*  But if we can't get it to the schools, how are they going to serve lunch? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=318.64s)]
*  It's crazy what they're doing here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=322.16s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly sounds like and they've certainly put Maine in the crosshairs all [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=323.6s)]
*  from that interaction that we highlighted earlier on. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=327.04s)]
*  But help us broaden the aperture here for a moment. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  Other than the Social Security and the Department of Agriculture, in your opinion, how else [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=332.8s)]
*  has the Trump administration been targeting the state of Maine? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=337.88s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=342.2s)]
*  They've been doing a variety of things. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=343.76s)]
*  They started off by taking all the funds from our Maine Sea Grant program. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=345.56s)]
*  Now that's a program that directly helps our fishermen who are challenged by ocean warming, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=349.24s)]
*  sea level rise, also helps our coastal communities. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=354.48s)]
*  And we were struck by some severe storms last year. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=357.48s)]
*  And the Sea Grant program helps with that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=360.64s)]
*  The whole delegation jumped on that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=362.7s)]
*  A few days later, they took it back. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=364.64s)]
*  Then they went to the University of Maine, said they were going to take away all the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=366.6s)]
*  funds for research on simple things like the potato beetle or PFAS in our soil. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=369.2s)]
*  A few days later, they took that back. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=375.12s)]
*  Then they went after the one that you heard about or you mentioned at the Social Security [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=377.74s)]
*  Administration where they're doing an incredible amount of damage. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  And just the very idea that a newborn, you know, a mom with a newborn baby in a very [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=384.92s)]
*  rural state has to go to a Social Security office. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=390.52s)]
*  I mean, it's just unthinkable. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=394.35999999999996s)]
*  But as you said, people pushed back and they took it back. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=395.35999999999996s)]
*  But this continues. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, somewhere in the middle there, Trump said he wanted a full-throated apology from [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  our governor. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  And then today we got this notice from the Secretary of Agriculture. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=407.56s)]
*  But let's face it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=410.88s)]
*  We think these are illegal and unconstitutional activities. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=411.88s)]
*  I'm an appropriator in Congress. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  We have the power of the purse. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=417.56s)]
*  He doesn't. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=418.76s)]
*  So he has no right or ability to take away this funding. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=419.76s)]
*  And then what kind of world do we live in where you get mad at a governor who has to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=423.56s)]
*  follow the laws of our state and also a recent Supreme Court decision. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=427.52s)]
*  So she's dealing within the parameters she's got. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=431.8s)]
*  And then you say, if you don't apologize or you're a petulant child, then suddenly your [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=434.5s)]
*  state is going to be denied this money. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=439.4s)]
*  Money that goes to farmers or to kids. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=441.16s)]
*  I mean, it's really outrageous. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=443.4s)]
*  I'm curious as to how your Republican colleagues are responding to the state of Maine, the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=445.88s)]
*  actual Republicans in the state of Maine, how are they responding to being targeted [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=451.48s)]
*  by the president of the United States, by the Social Security Administration, by seeing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=456.92s)]
*  some of the funding that you just outlined, you know, being on the chopping block simply [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=460.4s)]
*  for the governor of that state to say she is going to follow the law? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=465.12s)]
*  Well, I think some of them, as in Senator Collins, who fought hard to get the May secret [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=469.6s)]
*  money back and who doesn't want to see our funding targeted and as well as the chair [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=476.2s)]
*  of the Appropriations Committee has appropriately fought back. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=481.56s)]
*  You know, there are those in the legislature who will use this for their political gain. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=485.08s)]
*  It was a state legislator who started the fight on transgender athletes in our school. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=488.76s)]
*  By the way, we have two or maybe it's down to one. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Ry3TNlaRE&t=493.08s)]
