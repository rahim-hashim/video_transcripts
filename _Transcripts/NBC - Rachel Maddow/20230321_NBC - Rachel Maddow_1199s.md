# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 20
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI)
*  He has called for massive protest in response to his expected arrest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=0.0s)]
*  There are certainly isolated calls for violence online among his supporters, what the Associated [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=5.0s)]
*  Press characterized today as incendiary but isolated calls for civil war and violence [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=10.08s)]
*  and killing people. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=16.44s)]
*  But you do also have high-profile Trump supporters, like this guy, who we do have a mugshot of, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=20.8s)]
*  disgraced former New York police commissioner and convicted felon Bernie Carrick, now a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=27.68s)]
*  high-profile Trump supporter, he is now calling for law enforcement to mutiny, for law enforcement [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=31.28s)]
*  at all levels to refuse to enforce the law if there's any indictment against Donald Trump. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=38.92s)]
*  He's also got lots of high-profile Trump supporters leaning on the governor of Florida, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  saying that if Trump is indicted and he refuses to voluntarily turn himself in, then the Florida [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  governor, Ron DeSantis, should refuse law enforcement cooperation to extradite Trump [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=55.32s)]
*  to New York to face charges, that DeSantis should call out the Florida National Guard [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=60.52s)]
*  or something or have some other kind of state versus federal armed standoff where, I guess, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=64.84s)]
*  Trump will hide indefinitely in his Florida house and then there'll be like a war or something, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=71.04s)]
*  I guess, to try to stop him from being, from facing potential charges on falsification [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  of business records. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=83.36s)]
*  The reason this stuff matters is because it's one thing to wish for, to try to use violence [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=86.96s)]
*  and intimidation to constrain prosecutors. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=94.28s)]
*  That is not something we do in this country, but I think nobody believes that's a Rubicon [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=98.32s)]
*  that former President Trump doesn't want to cross, not after January 6th. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=102.28s)]
*  He knows what intimidation and violence by his supporters can do for him. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  And so, therefore, we have to watch that closely, and we're going to be watching very closely [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=113.76s)]
*  the logistics and the machinations of these possible prosecutions because he's calling [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=119.08s)]
*  for a large-scale protest, because we know he's not shy about the impact of violence [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=124.08s)]
*  potentially benefiting him and the impact of intimidation in terms of whether or not [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  it can constrain those who he perceives as his enemies. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=132.6s)]
*  We get that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=136.28s)]
*  What's worse than that, though, is if he wants to break the system, is if he wants to break [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=138.51999999999998s)]
*  the legal system in response to the legal system threatening him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  And beyond just threatening violence, you know, that's something that all the other [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  hundreds, all the other thousands of public corruption indictments in this country have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  not previously brought to our door. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=157.68s)]
*  But that is what not just former President Trump, but also Republicans more broadly, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=159.6s)]
*  are playing with right now. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=164.16s)]
*  I mean, right now, we have Republicans in the state legislature in Georgia passing themselves [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=165.92s)]
*  a new law by which they empower themselves to remove prosecutors in the middle of cases [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=170.6s)]
*  that the Republicans don't like. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=178.32s)]
*  Georgia Republicans have passed legislation to undo the independence of law enforcement [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  in Georgia. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  If that's what it takes to prevent the law being enforced against their leader. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=190.2s)]
*  Today, Trump's lawyers in Georgia filed a motion to have the prosecutor who's leading [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=195.92s)]
*  the investigation into Trump, they filed a motion to have her removed from that case, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=200.88s)]
*  while the bill that would allow Republicans in the state legislature to remove her from [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=205.44s)]
*  the case is on its way to that Republican governor's desk. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=208.88s)]
*  I mean, what do they think is going to be the outcome there in Georgia if they do this? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=211.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=215.56s)]
*  And they just want to set a new standard, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=216.6s)]
*  As long as there are Republicans controlling the state legislature there, prosecutors in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=218.0s)]
*  Georgia can only bring criminal charges against Democrats. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=221.96s)]
*  And not Republicans, because if you bring them against Republicans, the Republicans [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=226.68s)]
*  in the state legislature will take you out of your job. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=229.8s)]
*  I mean, that's the, is that what they're trying to set up? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=232.44s)]
*  Is that how they think things ought to work in Georgia? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=234.28s)]
*  That's how things ought to be changed in Georgia. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=236.44s)]
*  So they work like that now. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=238.44s)]
*  And the reason that change is justified is because, well, Donald Trump might get in trouble [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=240.34s)]
*  for some stuff. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=244.16s)]
*  It's one thing to not want your guy indicted. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=247.48s)]
*  It's another thing and a very bad thing to threaten violence and intimidation if your [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=251.32s)]
*  guy does get invited, indicted, excuse me. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=255.36s)]
*  But if your reaction to your guy potentially getting indicted is that you're going to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=259.2s)]
*  get rid of the system by which people get indicted, that's a bigger problem for the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=262.56s)]
*  whole country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=268.36s)]
*  And it's not just Georgia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=270.8s)]
*  Federally now, we have Republicans in Congress trying to summon the New York prosecutor to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=272.36s)]
*  Capitol Hill to give testimony as if they've got jurisdiction over him in this matter, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=277.48s)]
*  as if they, as Congress, can somehow constrain him from bringing New York state charges against [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=283.04s)]
*  an alleged criminal, as if they can somehow stop him from putting people on trial for [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  allegedly breaking New York state law. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is making these threats against the New York [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=297.2s)]
*  prosecutor. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=301.0s)]
*  He's encouraging Republican members of Congress who lead congressional committees that they [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=302.24s)]
*  should haul in this New York prosecutor to try somehow to stop him. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=306.04s)]
*  And so, yes, we're going to look at all of that tonight and we're going to get some expert [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  help to try to understand it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=314.0s)]
*  But we can be clear-eyed and confident here about what's new and what isn't, about what [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  poses a challenge to our system of government and what is our system of government. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=321.52s)]
*  And you know, we've all seen it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=328.08s)]
*  Every time a public official gets charged with a crime, they get that look in their [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=329.96s)]
*  eye, right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  They always say, oh, it's political persecution. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  My enemies just have to get me because of my position on taxes or gay rights or tort [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=336.52s)]
*  reform or whatever. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=342.12s)]
*  Or they say it's only because I'm so effective as a champion of the people, that's why they're [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  after me. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  They all try that kind of an argument. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  But they end up being memorable only for the quality of their mugshots. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=353.24s)]
*  Some of them get convicted, some of them get acquitted, some of them get charges dropped, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=357.32s)]
*  some of them keep committing more crimes and get superseding indictments laid on top of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=360.36s)]
*  the initial charges, and then we get two, two, two mugshots for the price of one. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=363.68s)]
*  But our system of government can handle it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=369.08s)]
*  Our system of government can demonstrably and absolutely handle the prosecution of alleged [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=371.6s)]
*  crimes committed by public officials and former public officials. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=376.56s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=380.52s)]
*  It will not break us. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=382.26s)]
*  It does not break us unless the political right and its support of Donald Trump decides [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=383.48s)]
*  that the prosecution of that particular former public official is reason enough to break [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=392.48s)]
*  our system of government, to break the legal system with not just threats of violence and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=397.20000000000005s)]
*  intimidation but by seizing partisan and political control of prosecutors' offices. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=401.5s)]
*  If former President Trump gets indicted, yes, it's unprecedented, but there is no inherent [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=412.44s)]
*  crisis in that for us as Americans. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=418.08s)]
*  Watch who tries to make it one. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=422.04s)]
*  That person is the attorney general of the great state of Texas, and that is, in fact, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=425.24s)]
*  his mugshot. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=429.8s)]
*  His name is Ken. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=430.8s)]
*  He was indicted and booked into the Cullen County Jail in Texas on felony securities [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=432.4s)]
*  fraud charges a few years ago. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=438.34s)]
*  Those felony charges are still pending against him. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=440.9s)]
*  He is still under indictment on multiple felony counts, but it hasn't held him back. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=443.73999999999995s)]
*  Since that mugshot was taken, since he has been under felony indictment, Mr. Ken Paxton [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=449.06s)]
*  has run for reelection as Texas Attorney General twice, and he has won both times. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=453.9s)]
*  I mean, eventually, presumably, he will go on trial on multiple felony counts, but at [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  Texas Republican voters don't mind that he's under indictment. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=467.22s)]
*  And judging from the look on his face, it doesn't seem to be bugging him much either. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  Even if you just want to stay in Texas, there's a whole bunch of these. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=477.5s)]
*  This is the very nice mugshot. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=480.46000000000004s)]
*  The composition isn't good. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=482.94000000000005s)]
*  There's a little too much headroom here, but the tie looks fantastic. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=484.18s)]
*  This is the mugshot of a man who was indicted in Texas in 2014 while he was serving as governor [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=487.58000000000004s)]
*  of Texas. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=492.58000000000004s)]
*  His name is Rick. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=493.58s)]
*  After he was indicted in 2014, he got fingerprinted. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=495.18s)]
*  He got this nice mugshot taken with the perfect knot in his tie. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=498.38s)]
*  Just a few months later, he announced he was running for president of the United States [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=502.94s)]
*  while he was still under felony indictment. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=506.65999999999997s)]
*  In fact, for the duration of his 2016 Republican presidential campaign, Rick Perry was under [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=509.71999999999997s)]
*  felony indictment. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=516.26s)]
*  They did not drop the felony charges against him until a few months after he had dropped [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=517.46s)]
*  out of the presidential race. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=521.94s)]
*  But even still, no big whoop. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=524.94s)]
*  Donald Trump went on to name him secretary of energy for the United States, which is [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=526.34s)]
*  a fact that is still just as amazing to behold as his mugshot is lovely. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=532.86s)]
*  Also staying in Texas, do you remember Tom DeLay? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=538.66s)]
*  He was the majority leader of the Republican Party in the U.S. House of Representatives. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=541.22s)]
*  He had to resign that job to have this mugshot taken after a warrant was issued for his arrest [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=545.74s)]
*  in 2005. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=551.38s)]
*  As mugshots go, though, it's kind of another nice one. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=553.24s)]
*  Not as nice as this one, though. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=556.9399999999999s)]
*  This is former Democratic vice presidential nominee and Democratic Senator John Edwards. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=558.74s)]
*  That's his mugshot from 2011. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=564.1s)]
*  Looking good, John Edwards. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=566.86s)]
*  Not looking as good, this is Dan, Mr. Rostinkowski. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=569.7s)]
*  He was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in Congress for 13 years until he had to stop [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=574.74s)]
*  doing that because it was time for him to stop being a congressman and to start being [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=580.32s)]
*  prisoner number 25338-016. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=584.32s)]
*  It happens. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=587.52s)]
*  It happens a lot. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=590.24s)]
*  Here was Bernie Carrick, New York police commissioner under Mayor Rudy Giuliani. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=592.64s)]
*  On Giuliani's recommendation, President George W. Bush tried to make this guy homeland security [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=597.36s)]
*  secretary of the United States before that had to end in favor of his new designation [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=602.6s)]
*  as prisoner number 210-717. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  It happens. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=610.76s)]
*  It happens. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=611.96s)]
*  It happens all the time in our country. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=612.96s)]
*  So much so that we have kind of a thing in mind when we think about what an elected official's [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=614.56s)]
*  mugshot looks like. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=618.28s)]
*  I mean, there are ones that are more special than others. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=620.28s)]
*  The Congressman James Trafiquant mugshot will always be remembered more as kind of a hairdo [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=624.36s)]
*  Hall of Fame thing than a congressman thing. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=629.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=633.16s)]
*  It's still really something all these years later. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=634.84s)]
*  But apart from him, I mean, there is something familiar enough about seeing members of Congress [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=637.8s)]
*  and governors and senators mugshots that we recognize them as a look, right? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=644.68s)]
*  I mean, it's a thing. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=649.9599999999999s)]
*  We've seen a lot of these. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=651.56s)]
*  And none of these mugshots, none of these arrests, arraignments, fingerprinting of these [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  public officials caused the world to end. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=661.4799999999999s)]
*  And the arrests of these governors and senators and congressmen ended up posing zero threat [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=664.32s)]
*  to our republic. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=669.7600000000001s)]
*  As it should be. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=673.1600000000001s)]
*  So why would that be any different now? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=675.32s)]
*  Yes, if former President Donald Trump is indicted in federal court in D.C. or in state court [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=678.32s)]
*  in Georgia or in state court in New York or anywhere else, yes, it would be unprecedented [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=684.88s)]
*  for there to be an indictment issued against a U.S. president or former president. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=690.12s)]
*  But we should also be real about the extent of exactly how historic this would be. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=695.12s)]
*  Because we arrest public officials all the time in this country. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=701.76s)]
*  And under the law, there's nothing magical about being a former president. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=705.0799999999999s)]
*  That's not a thing under the law. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=709.0999999999999s)]
*  Once you're a former anything, you're then just a citizen again and you are subject to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=710.8399999999999s)]
*  all the same laws as every other American. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=714.9599999999999s)]
*  But whether you like Mr. Trump or you do not like him, it is both fair play and relevant. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=718.7s)]
*  And it is starting to feel important to remember that our politics broadly is absolutely full [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=725.26s)]
*  of public officials, current and former public officials, both parties, neither party, every [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=732.38s)]
*  state in the union. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=738.0200000000001s)]
*  We are full of current and former public officials who have been charged with all kinds of crimes [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=739.38s)]
*  and convicted of everything imaginable. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=744.0600000000001s)]
*  Senators of Congress and senators and governors, even a serving attorney general like these [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=746.98s)]
*  guys, but also state legislators, big city mayors, statewide elected officials, cabinet [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=751.66s)]
*  officials, White House officials, it happens. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=756.14s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=758.46s)]
*  And while that's bad, well, it turns out we've had a lot of crooks in public office. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=760.36s)]
*  That doesn't feel great. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=765.5s)]
*  What's good about it is that we know how to deal with it when it happens. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=768.32s)]
*  It doesn't break our system. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=774.26s)]
*  It does not break our country to bring serious charges against public officials and former [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=775.78s)]
*  public officials. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=782.9s)]
*  Even these exact charges that are reportedly on deck against former President Donald Trump [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=783.9s)]
*  in New York, you will recall that this guy, a former senator, a Democratic Party vice [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=788.26s)]
*  presidential nominee, he was brought up on charges almost exactly like what's being reported [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=793.54s)]
*  about allegations against former President Trump. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=799.22s)]
*  John Edwards was brought up on charges for lying about and concealing a hush money payment [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=801.5s)]
*  that was made to cover up an alleged affair before an election. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=806.94s)]
*  Those exact charges were brought against a Democratic vice presidential nominee and former [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=811.18s)]
*  senator. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=815.62s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=816.62s)]
*  You forgot about it because the country wasn't exactly rocked to its foundations. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=817.72s)]
*  Another serving vice president, serving vice president, went up against a 40 count felony [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=824.1s)]
*  for crimes committed while he was in office. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=830.14s)]
*  With him, they forced him to resign his office as part of a plea deal in federal criminal [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=832.42s)]
*  court. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=836.58s)]
*  I did a podcast and a book about it and it blew everybody's mind because we'd completely [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=837.58s)]
*  forgotten about it because it didn't create a lasting problem for us as a country. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=842.3s)]
*  It does not bend the Constitution, let alone break it, to indict criminals for crimes. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=849.46s)]
*  Even when the alleged criminal is someone who has been elected to a very important job. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=854.38s)]
*  It is run-of-the-mill public corruption law enforcement in this country and we do it all [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=857.8s)]
*  the time. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=861.7199999999999s)]
*  And there is no reason why a former president should be magically immune from the same legal [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=862.7199999999999s)]
*  system that just in the past three years has put handcuffs on at least 13 state senators, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=867.5s)]
*  17 state representatives, one serving congressman, one former congressman, the Delaware state [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=873.28s)]
*  auditor, the North Carolina Republican Party chair, the insurance commissioner of Georgia, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=878.0s)]
*  and too many city councilors, alderman county executives, and mayors to count. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=882.02s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=888.4799999999999s)]
*  It really does not have to be the end of the world. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=889.56s)]
*  And anybody telling you that if there is an indictment of this particular former public [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=892.8399999999999s)]
*  official, there will be a protest like you've never seen before, there will be civil war, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=896.7199999999999s)]
*  there will be an unstoppable uprising among his supporters, and violence and all the rest, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=901.4s)]
*  anybody telling you that that is the consequence of him being potentially indicted? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=905.76s)]
*  Well, that person may be wishing for that, but there's no reason that something like [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=911.4s)]
*  that is inevitable. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=917.46s)]
*  This is not something coming up that is extraneous to our system that we need to invent something [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=919.4200000000001s)]
*  new to contend with. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=923.86s)]
*  The bottom line here is that prosecuting public officials and former public officials, it [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=926.72s)]
*  happens all the time in the United States of America. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=930.5400000000001s)]
*  And it never engenders violence. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=933.9000000000001s)]
*  And it never endangers the country. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=937.02s)]
*  And it doesn't require our legal system to be fundamentally rethought or dismantled. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=940.14s)]
*  Unless someone wants to try to gin that up. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=947.66s)]
*  And that is what we are contending with now, with this particular former public official. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=950.66s)]
*  There's nothing technically improper or rule breaking or illegal about a former president [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=957.46s)]
*  facing charges. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=964.62s)]
*  Even if it hasn't happened before, it doesn't break any rules. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=966.74s)]
*  But why has it never happened before? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=970.42s)]
*  Why has no one else before now considered a criminal indictment against a former president? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=975.0600000000001s)]
*  Is it because it's so dangerous, it's so unwise, it's so somehow against our system to prosecute [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=981.5s)]
*  a former president? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=988.1s)]
*  Or is it just because there's never been one before who has lived this way? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=990.34s)]
*  Yes, from a historical perspective, an indictment against a former president is unprecedented. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=995.7399999999999s)]
*  But given that we're talking about this particular former president, Donald J. Trump, can you [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1001.78s)]
*  honestly say to yourself that an indictment is a surprise? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1006.7399999999999s)]
*  The first thing anyone ever knew about his business practices was when he and his father [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1011.9399999999999s)]
*  had to settle with the Justice Department decades ago over accusations that they illegally [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1016.9s)]
*  refused to rent apartments to black people. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1021.88s)]
*  Then by the time he was entering politics, he was paying another gigantic settlement, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1026.12s)]
*  a $25 million settlement over fraud claims involving his fake university that he put [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1030.68s)]
*  his name on. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1036.88s)]
*  Then his family charity was shut down and fined millions of dollars as a fraud. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1038.76s)]
*  Then his national security advisor pled guilty to lying to the FBI twice. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1044.86s)]
*  Then his campaign chairman went to federal prison on fraud charges. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1049.6s)]
*  Then his deputy campaign chairman went to federal prison as well. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1053.02s)]
*  Then his personal lawyer went to federal prison on fraud and campaign finance charges. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1056.1s)]
*  Then his other personal lawyer had his law license suspended on his way to potential [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1059.9599999999998s)]
*  disbarment. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1063.3999999999999s)]
*  And his longest-serving political advisor was convicted on multiple felony counts and [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  sentenced to federal prison for, among other things, witness intimidation. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1068.36s)]
*  And his White House senior advisor was arrested on the yacht of a Chinese billionaire, picked [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1072.28s)]
*  up on fraud charges. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1078.6599999999999s)]

*  votes against him from members of his own party than any other president in history. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1091.1s)]
*  And even since then, his company, which is literally called the Trump Organization, was [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1095.6599999999999s)]
*  convicted on multiple felony fraud charges. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1100.62s)]

*  And when it comes to playing the odds and wondering what the stakes are for our country, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1111.38s)]
*  if an indictment, in fact, comes down for this former president, we literally have to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1116.38s)]
*  disambiguate the question so as to clarify which of the three known jurisdictions in [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1120.48s)]

*  or speaks in a way that other... [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1139.16s)]
*  You elect a guy with this kind of a life record. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIOChMwAShI&t=1142.32s)]
