# 'Our client has been disappeared': Lawyer seeks answers on Venezuelan imprisoned with no due process
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE)
*  This is from a declaration filed in court by a woman who fears her brother has been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=0.0s)]
*  deported to that Salvadoran prison. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=4.64s)]
*  She says her brother has never been part of a gang and that he has no criminal record. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=6.76s)]
*  Quote, I last spoke to him on March 14th, 2025, and believe he was removed to El Salvador [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=11.48s)]
*  shortly after that because I have not heard from him since then and I can no longer find [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=17.0s)]
*  him on the ICE detainee locator. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=20.62s)]
*  If he were detained anywhere in the U.S., I know he would contact me because we spoke [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=22.7s)]
*  almost daily while he was previously detained. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=26.64s)]
*  If he were back in Venezuela, I would hear from him as well. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=30.32s)]
*  I'm extremely concerned about the health and safety of my little brother. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=32.56s)]
*  From a declaration filed by an attorney for a young man, she says fled Venezuela for his [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  safety. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=42.04s)]
*  Quote, on Friday, March 14th, 2025, one of the attorneys assigned to his case called [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=43.04s)]
*  the detention facility where he was thought to be to try to schedule a legal call. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  He was told by the facility that his client was no longer there. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  He asked where his client was and was told by the facility employee that he did not know. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=55.88s)]
*  Here's immigration lawyer Lindsay Teslowski. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=61.32000000000001s)]
*  Quote, our client worked in the arts in Venezuela. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=63.64s)]
*  He is LGBTQ. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=67.08s)]
*  His tattoos are benign. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=69.2s)]
*  But ICE submitted photos of his tattoos as evidence he is a gang member. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=70.92s)]
*  His attorney planned to present evidence he is not. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=74.76s)]
*  But he never got the chance because our client has been disappeared. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Joining us now is Lindsay Teslowski. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=83.16s)]
*  She's president of Immigrant Defenders Law Center. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=84.92s)]
*  Ms. Teslowski, thank you so much for being here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=86.96s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=88.52s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=89.52s)]
*  So this is unusual. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=91.96s)]
*  And correct me if I am wrong. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  I know that you have not previously identified your client when speaking to the press or [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=96.0s)]
*  when speaking publicly. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=99.52s)]
*  But I understand that you want to share his first name and some photos with our viewers [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=101.12s)]
*  tonight. Is that correct? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=105.72s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=107.72s)]
*  Names and identities of people have been shared today via a list. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  And so we know that it is inevitable that our client will be identified. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=114.64s)]
*  And we feel it's important to let the world know who Andri, our client, is because he [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=118.44s)]
*  is a human being. He is a young professional from Venezuela. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=125.28s)]
*  He's a makeup artist. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=129.44s)]
*  He is a gay man. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=131.32s)]
*  He is someone who came to the United States seeking protection. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=133.0s)]
*  He came seeking asylum. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=137.08s)]
*  Upon entry into the United States, he was detained because of his tattoos, some of which [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=139.84s)]
*  you can see in those photos. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  But these are not the tattoos of somebody who is involved with gangs. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=148.44s)]
*  These are normal tattoos that you would see on anybody at a coffee shop anywhere in the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=152.96s)]
*  United States or Venezuela. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=157.68s)]
*  And today we have confirmation from the government. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=160.4s)]
*  One of the few groups or attorneys that have confirmation that our client is indeed in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=164.36s)]
*  El Salvador. You know, our client last week was supposed to appear in court where we [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  would have started the process of refuting the baseless allegations against him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  But we never got to have that chance. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=180.04000000000002s)]
*  Our client has been forcibly removed and disappeared. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  And we don't know what his legal case, where it goes from here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  Do you know if he has any legal recourse at all? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=191.08s)]
*  Do you have any means of contacting him? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=194.68s)]
*  Or do you have any means of trying to track one down if you don't have one now? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=196.68s)]
*  So the only reason we know that our client is in El Salvador is because he was supposed [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=201.88000000000002s)]
*  to be in court last Thursday. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=206.8s)]
*  ICE never presented him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=208.8s)]
*  Over the ensuing days, we realized that he was likely part of this group of planes that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=210.68s)]
*  went to El Salvador. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=216.36s)]
*  When we went to court on Monday, we were finally told by ICE that it was confirmed he was [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=218.16s)]
*  in El Salvador. In that moment, they said that he was removed to El Salvador. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  The immigration judge said, how is it possible that he's been removed if there's no [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  removal order? And the ICE attorney that was in the courtroom said, I don't know. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  The case has been set over. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=237.56s)]
*  So we do have a hearing coming up in a couple of weeks. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=238.84s)]
*  But ICE has now told us that they will not facilitate communication with our client [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=241.48000000000002s)]
*  because he has, in their words, been removed and that they will not make him available [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=245.76s)]
*  for that hearing in two weeks. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=250.76s)]
*  So at this point, we are, of course, watching the case closely that is ongoing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=253.0s)]
*  related to the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=258.32s)]
*  And we're pursuing all avenues because, you know, our client's life is at risk. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=260.36s)]
*  We're concerned for his safety. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  And the fact that he was, you know, forcibly taken from the United States with no due [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=266.84s)]
*  process, you know, it's just it's something that really shocks the conscience in a way [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=271.88s)]
*  that we haven't seen since family separation happened in 2018. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=278.04s)]
*  Yeah, the blunt and unsupported assertion that all of these people must have been [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=283.04s)]
*  terrible gang members. And then the photos of your client there, I think, speak [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=287.24s)]
*  many thousands of words. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=292.28s)]
*  Lindsay Teslowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, representing this [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=294.2s)]
*  young man. Thank you for your time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=298.48s)]
*  I know that this is a developing story. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=300.0s)]
*  I hope it is a legally developing story and I hope you'll keep us apprised. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=301.96s)]
*  Thanks for being with us tonight. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQNLF8ddaE&t=307.03999999999996s)]
