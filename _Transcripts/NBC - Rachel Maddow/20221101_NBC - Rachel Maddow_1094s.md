# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Oct. 31
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM)
*  So, the criminal trial of Donald Trump's family business got underway today, the trial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=0.0s)]
*  in which his namesake company is charged with engaging in a 15-year, multimillion-dollar [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=4.72s)]
*  tax evasion scheme. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=9.38s)]
*  We're eight days out from the midterm elections, right? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=11.22s)]
*  For the de facto leader of the Republican Party, their last president, their all-but-certain [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=15.22s)]
*  nominee for president in the next election, this is a very awkward time to be dragged [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=19.2s)]
*  into court for a criminal tax evasion trial. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=24.36s)]
*  But I got to tell you, that's like one egg and a whole carton for him today. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=28.0s)]
*  I mean, also, simultaneously today, the criminal trial continues of Trump's longtime friend, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  the chair of his presidential inauguration committee, Tom Barrack. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=37.88s)]
*  Barrack is charged with acting as a secret agent of a foreign government, trying to influence [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=42.6s)]
*  the U.S. government in order to make money for himself from a foreign power. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=48.08s)]
*  So today, jury selection began in a civil trial of Trump and his company over charges [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  that he ordered his security guards to physically attack protesters outside Trump Tower during [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  Trump's campaign. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  Trump himself had to sit for a deposition in that civil case. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=64.16s)]
*  That's not to be confused with the deposition he also had to sit for a couple of weeks ago [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=67.28s)]
*  in the defamation case deriving from a woman alleging that he raped her in the mid-'90s. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=71.0s)]
*  Also, today, Trump petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and block the House of Representatives [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  from getting a copy of his tax returns, which he's been desperately trying for years to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=84.0s)]
*  keep anyone from seeing. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=88.56s)]
*  Also, Trump is now on his knockoff social media site ranting about how he cannot believe [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=90.36s)]
*  that the Mar-a-Lago classified documents federal criminal case is still going on, even as one [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  of his most loyal lieutenants just pled the fifth before a grand jury considering that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=101.08s)]
*  which, by the way, if you're keeping score at home, brings the number of people in Trump's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=106.48s)]
*  orbit who've pled the fifth in various recent cases to at least nine, including Trump himself, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=109.0s)]
*  who spent hours taking the fifth in yet another investigation, the New York Attorney General's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=115.24s)]
*  investigation of his financial practices. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=119.6s)]
*  Also, in the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into his efforts to violently [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=122.88s)]
*  overthrow the government on January 6th, the Justice Department is now asking a federal [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=128.32s)]
*  judge to compel Trump's White House counsel and his deputy White House counsel to testify [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=132.8s)]
*  about their conversations with him before that federal grand jury. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=138.24s)]
*  Also, the seditious conspiracy trial continues of the right-wing pro-Trump paramilitary group, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=142.16s)]
*  the Oath Keepers, who say they came to Washington on January 6th to fight physically to keep [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=147.64s)]
*  Trump in power. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=152.76s)]
*  At that trial today, there was dramatic testimony from Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=154.32s)]
*  told the jury about physically blocking a group of Oath Keepers from getting to Nancy [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  Pelosi's office on January 6th as he and his colleagues raced to get her staffers to safety. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's what's going on around the leader of the Republican Party just today, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  all in a day's work, eight days before the midterm elections. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=176.8s)]
*  And all of this, it is not unrelated to the precarious political moment that we are in, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  right? A system that operates on the rule of law and free and fair elections doesn't [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=185.04s)]
*  work all that well for a party whose leader is in personal legal jeopardy under that system [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=190.48s)]
*  in all these different ways, whose family business is literally on trial right now, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=196.11999999999998s)]
*  as of today, on criminal charges. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=201.56s)]
*  Even as President Biden was calling the new president-elect, the newspapers in Brazil [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=206.04s)]
*  today carried a statement from Trump adviser Steve Bannon saying there's no possibility [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=210.0s)]
*  that the election result is correct, that Bolsonaro should start a months-long ballot-by-ballot [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=215.28s)]
*  audit of the results, and that whatever he does, he definitely shouldn't leave office. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=221.0s)]
*  He should stay in office despite the election results. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=225.96s)]
*  In a live stream last night responding to the election results in Brazil, Steve Bannon [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=230.16s)]
*  said it more bluntly. He said Bolsonaro, quote, can't concede. Can't concede. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=234.12s)]
*  Why not? Why can't he concede? And why do you care, Steve Bannon? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=240.12s)]
*  I mean, this is the part that's about us, that's about us and our country and our election [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=248.12s)]
*  next week. Because why do you think it is that this top White House adviser to former [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=255.12s)]
*  President Donald Trump, why do you think it is that he's telling this guy in Brazil, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=261.76000000000005s)]
*  this Trump-like, far-right, buffoonish, unpopular Brazilian president who's just been voted [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=267.08000000000004s)]
*  out of office, why is Steve Bannon telling him that he shouldn't admit to the election [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=272.48s)]
*  results, he shouldn't admit that he's been voted out, he cannot concede? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=277.72s)]
*  Why do you think Bannon is doing that? Do you think that Steve Bannon has some substantive [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  fact-based beliefs about the integrity of Brazil's elections? Do you think he has some [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  facts that he knows that have made him concerned about how votes are counted in São Paulo, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=292.04s)]
*  really? Do you think he has important information about something being wrong with a voting [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=297.32s)]
*  machine in Santa Catarina or some other place in Brazil he's never been to that I'm probably [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=301.48s)]
*  mispronouncing? I mean, why do you think Steve Bannon cares? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=306.2s)]
*  Why did Trump endorse Bolsonaro and endorse his voter fraud claims even in advance of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=312.2s)]
*  the election? Why is it that we can be absolutely 100% sure that if Trump were still president [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=317.08s)]
*  instead of Joe Biden, the U.S. government itself would be refusing to acknowledge that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=323.08s)]
*  Bolsonaro just lost this election? Why? Why do they do this? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=327.76s)]
*  It is not about Brazil. It is about us. It is about propagating and inculcating into [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=333.76s)]
*  us, or at least inculcating into their supporters this assertion, this belief, this conviction [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=341.76s)]
*  that elections are bad, that elections are suspect, that elections are for suckers. And [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=349.12s)]
*  anybody who's not a sucker shouldn't believe any election result anywhere. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=355.92s)]
*  Elections suck. They're a hoax. They're a racket. We shouldn't use them. We know better. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=362.36s)]
*  And this line of attack, it isn't about any one election. It's not about any particular [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=368.96s)]
*  allegation of something being wrong with some particular election. It's about elections [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=373.0s)]
*  as elections. It's about elections as a category. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=378.48s)]
*  And you can see it at work in all these different instances, right? That's how you can see it [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=382.44s)]
*  sort of. There's no exceptions here. It's a rule. You can see it at work with Trump [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=386.96s)]
*  and his remoras like Steve Bannon insisting that Trumpy guys all around the world shouldn't [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=391.15999999999997s)]
*  have to abide by election results. You can see it at home coming into sharper focus now, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  now that we're eight days out from the next national election. Trump issuing a new endorsement [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=402.08s)]
*  of the Republican candidate who's running against Senator Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=407.04s)]
*  in this election. Trump endorses him now by saying outright that what he likes about the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=411.64s)]
*  guy is that he is, quote, a strong and proud election denier. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=415.68s)]
*  So they're embracing that term now. You must be a strong and proud election denier. Those [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=422.68s)]
*  are Trump's words in order to get his endorsement as the de facto leader of the Republican Party. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=428.56s)]
*  You also see it in that odd footage that's being aired by Fox News over the past few [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=436.2s)]
*  days of Trump calling the Republican Senate candidate in Arizona, this guy, Blake Masters, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=439.98s)]
*  the one who's running against Democratic Senator Mark Kelly. Trump tells him on the call that, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=445.26s)]
*  hey, Blake Masters, you're doing great, but you need to go harder and louder and more [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=450.12s)]
*  insistent on the issue of election denial. You need to be more out there volunteering [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  all the time saying that elections shouldn't count. And Blake Masters says, oh, yes, I'll [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=458.44s)]
*  do that. I'll go hard on that issue. Why does Trump need that? Why does Trump need [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=463.68s)]
*  that from this Senate candidate in Arizona or the Senate candidate in Nevada? They're [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  not going to be voting on anything related to the 2020 election where Trump lost. Why [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=472.72s)]
*  does Trump want to do this? Why does he want all Republican candidates at every level to [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=477.47999999999996s)]
*  insist that elections are for suckers and that election results don't count? The reason [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=484.52s)]
*  he wants to do this is so this idea that elections shouldn't be the way we do things anymore [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=493.4s)]
*  becomes the rallying cry in the operating principle of the Republican Party. And it's [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=500.23999999999995s)]
*  working within the Republican Party. Ever since Trump won the Republican nomination [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=504.8s)]
*  for president in 2016, thanks to a Republican primary system, he said was rigged and fraudulent. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  And then he won the general election that year and still said there was fraud in that [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=515.36s)]
*  election. There were millions of illegal votes cast in that election. Even in elections that [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=519.2s)]
*  he wins, he says there was fraud, right? Right through to the 2020 campaign, where even before [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=524.04s)]
*  the election, he claimed that election was fraudulent and that it shouldn't count. Why [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=529.0799999999999s)]
*  would you try to undermine faith in an election that you won? Why would you try to undermine [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=535.0s)]
*  faith in elections in other countries that most Americans can't spell? Why would you [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=540.68s)]
*  try to get everybody in your party to say that election results don't count even when [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  they're not in a position to reverse some sort of election result to put you back in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=550.8s)]
*  power? It's so that the idea that elections don't count becomes the operating principle of the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=554.8s)]
*  Republican Party. Say elections are messed up. Insist that you have proof of some kind that you [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=562.24s)]
*  can't show right now, but you have it. Proof that the elections are messed up. On the basis of your [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=569.04s)]
*  false claims that the elections are messed up, then set about actually messing up elections to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  prove your point. That's the phrase that we're in now, right? There's 67 counties in Pennsylvania. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=580.48s)]
*  In 50 of those 67 counties, the elections chiefs have left office since the last election [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=586.72s)]
*  because of threats and intimidation. 50 out of the 67 counties in the state. How smoothly do you think [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=592.72s)]
*  elections are going to go in that state this year? In Nevada, there's 17 counties. Election supervisors [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=599.72s)]
*  in 10 of the 17 counties in the state have left already or announced they are leaving. Again, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=605.32s)]
*  ahead of threats and intimidation from the political right. You may have seen the news over [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=610.32s)]
*  the weekend about this Republican controlled county in Nevada that is breaking its election system so [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=616.1600000000001s)]

*  And that's the only way they want to count. This is a system they are newly inventing that last week [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=628.72s)]
*  took 60 people one full day to count 900 votes poorly. 60 people counting. A full day's work. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=633.84s)]
*  Less than a thousand votes counted. Here's the Associated Press. Quote, two groups of five [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=642.8000000000001s)]
*  counters that the AP observed spent about three hours each counting 50 ballots. Mismatched tallies [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=648.72s)]
*  led to recounts and occasionally to more recounts. Several of the counters noted how arduous the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  process was. With one volunteer lamenting, I can't believe it's two hours to get through 25 votes. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=661.12s)]
*  Yeah. If this is how you're going to count them, this is a county with 33,000 registered votes. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=667.6s)]
*  Took 60 people a full day to get through less than a thousand votes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  They've got 33,000 registered voters in that county. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=680.8s)]
*  They're getting rid of the election system there effectively. They're having randos just personally [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=684.56s)]
*  rifle through the ballots and see what they might come up with. To get through 33,000 votes on actual [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=689.4399999999999s)]
*  election day where there's a tight Senate race and other stuff that's really important on the ballot. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=694.16s)]
*  Yeah, it might take them a few months. I don't know, maybe a year to get some kind of tally. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=698.56s)]
*  Nobody will have much faith in it when they do. It's a system, right? Say the elections are messed [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=702.7199999999999s)]
*  up. On the basis of that actually do mess them up. Then when the elections are messed up, claim [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=709.84s)]
*  vindication and show everyone, Hey, look, this election thing we used to do. It's just too broken [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=715.2s)]
*  to even try to use that anymore. Wow. What a mess. Why would anybody believe those results? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  Let's throw the results out. NBC News reports that Paul Pelosi is still in the ICU tonight [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=726.24s)]
*  after the attacks surrounded by family members. The state's election campaign is still being [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=733.2s)]
*  held. The president's response to the attack is that he's 82 years old. He reportedly has [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=737.36s)]
*  extensive injuries to multiple body parts, including a fractured skull. Donald Trump Jr. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=742.24s)]
*  responded to the attack by saying he was working on his Paul Pelosi Halloween costume. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=751.12s)]
*  And he posted a picture of a hammer and a pair of underwear. And he posted another picture of [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=756.72s)]
*  a hammer saying it was for open carry in San Francisco. That's the son of former president Trump. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=761.92s)]
*  Charlie Kirk, who's the head of a big pro Trump conservative pack. He said today that some amazing [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=769.76s)]
*  patriot, that was his phrase, amazing patriot should post bail for the attacker. And that person [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=776.8s)]
*  would be a midterm hero if they did it. Carrie Lake is the Republican candidate for governor [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=782.0799999999999s)]
*  in Arizona. She got a big laugh, big round of applause on this subject this weekend. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=790.0s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi. Well, she's got protection when she's in DC. Apparently her house doesn't have [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=796.48s)]
*  a lot of protection, but big laugh line for her. But play the play that tape again. You can see [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=800.56s)]
*  the moderator of the event on the left side of your screen. It looks like he's laughing so hard [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=810.16s)]
*  he might fall over. Oh, it's just hilarious fracturing his skull with a hammer. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=814.64s)]
*  There's been a lot of reporting already about the assailant, his perceived beliefs, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=822.3199999999999s)]
*  his writings online, his writing online. To use a technical term, I would say he seems like a nut [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=828.9599999999999s)]
*  ball. That's how I would classify him. But his recent writings, you know, for what it's worth, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=836.56s)]
*  they're all conspiracy theories and rantings that circulate on the far right. Holocaust denial, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=842.56s)]
*  Jewish bankers, COVID vaccines are a conspiracy. QAnon stuff, he wrote Q is Trump himself. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=848.4799999999999s)]
*  And the real racism is racism against white people. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=856.2399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I dismiss him as a nut ball. And I speak about those things with admitted derision, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=860.9599999999999s)]
*  because in my opinion, honestly, none of us should feel obliged to play in the sewer of [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=866.16s)]
*  that man's mind. Once you hit someone in the head with a hammer, all of humanity is officially and [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=870.8s)]
*  forever excused from needing to learn about your thoughts and feelings. But if you're a person who [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=876.9599999999999s)]
*  has all your faculties, and you know that something like this has happened, if you minimize it, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=882.88s)]
*  mock it, celebrate it, the attempted murder of the Speaker of the House's husband, what is now [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=889.8399999999999s)]
*  formally charged as the attempted kidnapping of the Speaker of the House? Well, if that's how you [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=896.0s)]
*  react to knowing this has happened, well, then you're telling us what you want instead of politics. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=901.12s)]
*  You're telling everybody what you want to be able to do, what you want your side to be able to do [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=909.28s)]
*  to your political opponents, what you enjoy seeing your political opponents subjected to. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=914.08s)]
*  And that is, in fact, the other option if we're not going to have elections anymore. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=921.92s)]
*  It's either violence in force or it's voting. And if it is not voting, then it is going to be [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=926.64s)]
*  violence in force. We're eight days out from the first national election since the last Republican [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=932.64s)]
*  president, the leader of their party, tried to stay in power by force. And, you know, on Friday, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=940.72s)]
*  a man pled guilty in federal court to threatening to kill Congressman Eric Swalwell and his staff. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=948.8s)]
*  Also last week, three people were just found guilty of their part in a militia kidnapping [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=954.24s)]
*  plot targeting the governor of Michigan. Today, Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn testified in [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=958.4s)]
*  the seditious conspiracy trial of the pro-Trump paramilitary group, the Oath Keepers, for their [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=963.36s)]
*  role in Trump's effort to have a violent mob of his supporters overthrow the government and keep [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=968.72s)]
*  him in power by force. In power, by force, despite the election results, in power despite the election [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=972.88s)]
*  results, and therefore by force. Those are the choices, right? It's either elections or it's [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=982.08s)]
*  force and violence. We are eight days out. In this election, a clear majority of Republican [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=992.72s)]
*  candidates for congressional and statewide offices say election results should no longer count. They [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  do not believe in election results. Even below that level, in state legislative races, look, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=1005.2s)]
*  clear majorities of Republican candidates in those races, in the swing states, they say election [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=1012.0s)]
*  results shouldn't count. They don't believe them. We shouldn't use elections anymore. If they do not [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=1016.9599999999999s)]
*  want us to have elections anymore, don't kid yourself that there is another good option. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=1021.52s)]
*  It is democracy or it's not. And if it's not, it's violence and force. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=1026.24s)]
*  This is the year, this is the election when your vote, up and down to the very bottom of the ballot, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=1033.12s)]
*  is an answer to this one question. Is it democracy or is it force and violence? Our vote this year [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=1038.6399999999999s)]
*  is about whether we ever get to vote again. This is not the year to sit out. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=1046.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WZPZUf0PAM&t=1092.32s)]
