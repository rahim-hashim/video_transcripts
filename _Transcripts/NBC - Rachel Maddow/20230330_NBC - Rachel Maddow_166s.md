# Maddow: Prepare for New York D.A.'s Trump case to be... boring
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE)
*  While tonight's news is not a surprise, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=0.0s)]
*  while this is something that we have been expecting for a long while now, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=3.0s)]
*  while this is something that we certainly have been thinking through the implications of for a very long while now, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=7.0s)]
*  so while this does not come out of the blue, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=11.0s)]
*  I do think there's one thing we all need to be preparing for here that we are maybe not prepared for. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=16.0s)]
*  And that is what I think is the very high probability [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=22.0s)]
*  that this is going to be boring. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=28.0s)]
*  I'm not sure we're prepared for that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=32.0s)]
*  I'm not sure either side ideologically is prepared for that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=34.0s)]
*  I don't think the punditocracy is prepared for that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=37.0s)]
*  I don't think you and I tonight are prepared for that, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=39.0s)]
*  because this feels like really big news and really big news feels like it has a lot of momentum. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=42.0s)]
*  But as far as I can tell, right, this is about a legal proceeding starting. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=47.0s)]
*  And if you look at the kind of legal proceeding this is going to be, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=52.0s)]
*  I think we need to prepare ourselves for the fact that, A, this might go on for a really long time, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=56.0s)]
*  and it might go on where the incremental additional news on this news story each day [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=61.0s)]
*  is something that feels like reading the small print on the back of a lottery ticket [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=67.0s)]
*  or even your car rental insurance waiver. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=71.0s)]
*  This might really be boring. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=74.0s)]
*  And I say that because I do think the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=77.0s)]
*  overheated expectation for how this transforms us as a country [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=83.0s)]
*  is something that's almost always born to disappoint. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=88.0s)]
*  But I also say it because this isn't something that is unprecedented in the world of criminal law. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=94.0s)]
*  The actual adjudication of cases like this one, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=101.0s)]
*  as much as we know about what kind of case this is before the indictment is unsealed, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=104.0s)]
*  the actual adjudication of cases like this is often a very boring thing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=108.0s)]
*  I will tell you, since this particular district attorney, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=113.0s)]
*  Alvin Bragg, has been the district attorney for Manhattan, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=116.0s)]
*  his office has reportedly charged falsification of business records as a felony count 117 times. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=118.0s)]
*  He has not been DA for that long, but in that time, he's indicted on this charge 117 times. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=127.0s)]
*  And that's what you call trivia, because it's not that important. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=135.0s)]
*  Not one of those cases was interesting enough to make the news on its own terms. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=140.0s)]
*  I'm Alvin Bragg. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IgVfs51IPE&t=165.0s)]
