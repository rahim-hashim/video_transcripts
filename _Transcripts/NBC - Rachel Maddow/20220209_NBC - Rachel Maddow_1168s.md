# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 8
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 09, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE)
*  One more thing before we go tonight, let's call it a trip down memory lane. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's the email that Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort received 11 days after the 2016 [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=4.8s)]
*  election from a Chicago banker, subject, quote, Stephen M. Kalk, candidate for SEC Army. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=10.24s)]
*  The attachment says, quote, perspective roles in the Trump administration in rank order. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=16.92s)]
*  Yes, that is roles as in job functions and not the things into which I put my chicken [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=22.12s)]
*  salad. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=26.44s)]
*  She goes on to list them, quote, one secretary of the Army to Deputy Secretary of Treasury, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=27.44s)]
*  three secretary of commerce. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=32.64s)]
*  That email about Stephen Kalk, by the way, was from Stephen Kalk. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=34.88s)]
*  This guy, the former CEO of a Midwestern bank called the Federal Savings Bank. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=37.82s)]
*  And that was not any ordinary pitch email from someone trying to curry favor with the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=42.900000000000006s)]
*  incoming administration. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=47.16s)]
*  It was, in fact, a bribe. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  You see, in July of 2016, Paul Manafort, who was at the time Trump's campaign manager, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=51.42s)]
*  came to Stephen Kalk's bank seeking a multimillion dollar loan. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=57.96s)]
*  The one glaring problem was that Manafort had a lot of red flags on his financials. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=61.56s)]
*  He was deep in debt. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=65.88s)]
*  He had multiple properties facing foreclosure and he needed the money and he needed it fast. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=66.88s)]
*  So he struck a deal with Kalk. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=73.62s)]
*  Kalk ignored the red flags on Manafort's financials and ended up securing Manafort two loans totaling [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  a whopping 16 million dollars. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=81.48s)]
*  Days after approving the first loan for Manafort, Kalk was appointed to the Trump Campaign's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=86.8s)]
*  Economic Advisory Council. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=90.2s)]
*  When Manafort needed that multimillion dollar second loan, this time Kalk approved it and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=92.56s)]
*  shortly thereafter sent Manafort a list of administration jobs that he wanted. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=98.4s)]
*  Manafort did end up getting Kalk an interview in Trump Tower for Undersecretary of the Army, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=104.6s)]
*  but Kalk never got the job. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  He did eventually get indicted for that scheme by federal prosecutors in New York City. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=112.4s)]
*  He was convicted in July of financial institution bribery and conspiracy and yesterday, nearly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=116.68s)]
*  six years after the start of that bribery scheme, Kalk was finally sentenced. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  The Department of Justice aptly puts the news in its headline announcing the news, quote, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=128.08s)]
*  bank CEO Stephen M. Kalk sentenced to one year and one day for corruptly soliciting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=132.04s)]
*  a presidential administration position in exchange for approving 16 million dollars in loans. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=138.32s)]
*  In addition to spending 366 days in prison, Kalk must pay over 1.2 million dollars in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  fines, complete 800 hours of community service, and undergo two years of supervised release. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=150.2s)]
*  As for Manafort, he too was convicted of multiple felonies and other schemes, including bank [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  fraud and filing false tax returns, but he is free, of course, because Donald Trump [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=161.64s)]
*  pardoned him right before he left office. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=167.72s)]
*  Nice work if you can get it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=171.24s)]
*  On January 5th of last year, the day before the attack on the Capitol, there was a meeting [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=174.12s)]
*  in a random D.C. parking garage between the leaders of two of the most radical right-wing [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=177.84s)]
*  extremist groups in America, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=183.64s)]
*  We've known about this meeting for a little while now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=189.12s)]
*  No one involved has been particularly forthcoming about the purpose of that clandestine meet-up, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=190.96s)]
*  but now we know that the FBI is trying to figure it out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=196.28s)]
*  Reuters exclusively reporting today that federal investigators are now looking into that meeting [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=199.4s)]
*  between the two extremist groups, which took place 24 hours before members of both groups [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=204.0s)]
*  orchestrated a coordinated attack to try and overthrow the results of the election. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=209.96s)]
*  To stop something like January 6th from ever happening again, part of the complicated, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=215.48s)]
*  granular work that has to be done is to really understand how these kinds of extremist groups [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=219.72s)]
*  operate. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=225.28s)]
*  Because until that shoe leather work is done, it's just kind of like pulling up weeds. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=226.6s)]
*  More and more threats from more extremist groups will keep popping up. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=231.56s)]
*  You have to dig deeper. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=234.68s)]
*  You have to pull the whole system up by the root. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=235.68s)]
*  And in tandem with this new line of inquiry by the FBI, it seems like there's another [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=238.6s)]
*  team of investigators that are doing just that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=244.04s)]
*  Reporter Ben Collins here at NBC News is something of an extremist expert. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=247.88s)]
*  He operates in and among those weeds, and he's out with fresh reporting about how investigators [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=251.02s)]
*  from the January 6th investigation in Congress are trying to piece together the origin stories [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=255.78s)]
*  of these two extremist groups in the hopes that it'll shed light on the Capitol riot. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=261.5s)]
*  Quote, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=266.54s)]
*  The committee's investigators are zeroing in on events attended by members of the Proud [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=267.54s)]
*  Boys and Oath Keepers in 2020. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=271.38s)]
*  Those events include COVID lockdown protests, counter protests to some racial justice demonstrations, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=274.42s)]
*  armed protest activity focused on state capitals across the U.S. and stop the steel rallies [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=280.98s)]
*  that occurred prior to January 6th, 2021. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  The investigators assigned to the domestic extremism inquiry are split into two teams. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=290.82s)]
*  The red team is concentrating on the events that took place on January 6th. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=295.86s)]
*  And then there's a whole separate team, the purple team, looking into how these anti-democracy [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=300.46000000000004s)]
*  factions formed in the months before January 6th and how they've evolved in the year since. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=306.3s)]
*  And the goal behind this is pretty straightforward. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=312.1s)]
*  Quote, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=314.7s)]
*  The goal, according to several of the investigators who spoke with NBC News, is to determine whether [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=315.7s)]
*  these earlier events were proving grounds, opportunities to network, or places to encourage [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=320.54s)]
*  one another to cross red lines into future violence. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=326.90000000000003s)]
*  Joining us now is NBC senior reporter Ben Collins, who covers disinformation and extremism. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=331.3s)]
*  He broke this new reporting today. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  My friend, it's good to see you. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=337.94s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=339.06s)]
*  Ben, what kind of things are they looking for that will demonstrate what you report [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=340.58s)]
*  in your reporting, that they're looking to see what they were doing at these other things [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=346.98s)]
*  and what connection they had to January 6th? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=352.14s)]
*  Yeah, they're looking for hard and fast connections between groups like the Oath Keepers and the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=354.74s)]
*  Proud Boys and QAnon conspiracy theorists that happened over the last year before the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=361.14s)]
*  January 6th riot. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=367.82s)]
*  That includes things like those state capital protests in Oregon and in Michigan that kind [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=369.38s)]
*  of presaged what happened on January 6th. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=375.62s)]
*  If you remember the one from Michigan that ended in the idea that they were going to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=378.62s)]
*  take the governor, it was a similarly violently rhetorical protest. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=383.62s)]
*  So they're looking for hard and fast connections there, but they're also looking for ideological [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=390.98s)]
*  similarities between some of these groups. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=394.22s)]
*  So the Proud Boys and QAnon people, they don't necessarily have a lot in common. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=396.54s)]
*  A lot of Proud Boys look down on QAnon people, they view them as silly, and it's still kind [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  of unclear how they came to the same conclusion that January 6th, they all had to storm the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=405.26s)]
*  Capitol and they all had to fight back for President Trump. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=409.18s)]
*  Some of these people have been charged in the litany of charges that a lot of the demonstrators [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=413.14000000000004s)]
*  face. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=418.18s)]
*  They've been charged very specifically with conspiracy, but not a lot of them are cooperating. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=419.38s)]
*  Is there some idea that they can get people like you would in the mob, get people who [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=424.90000000000003s)]
*  are lower down who don't have the resources or the gumption to hold out to start telling [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=429.02s)]
*  authorities what's behind some of these organizations? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=434.54s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=437.22s)]
*  And some are cooperating, by the way. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=439.3s)]
*  Stuart Rhodes, who is a member of the Oath Keepers, last week dialed into a video conference. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=440.62s)]
*  He was indicted by the Feds, but he still dialed into a video conference with the January [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=446.90000000000003s)]
*  6th committee and he didn't completely take the fifth. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=451.06s)]
*  He did answer some questions. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=453.22s)]
*  There's a lot of trees to shake here. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=456.22s)]
*  You're going to see a lot of that over time. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=458.5s)]
*  And they also have both the Feds and the January 6th committee, they have more hard and fast [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=460.94s)]
*  data that has nothing to do with people's testimonies. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=467.58000000000004s)]
*  That has to do with where people were on that day and the days before, social media posts, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=469.86s)]
*  things like that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=474.66s)]
*  So, you know, they are going to get to the bottom of this, it seems like. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=475.78000000000003s)]
*  It's just going to take a while. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=479.82000000000005s)]
*  You're right, this was actually published in Lawfare, but it talks about the fact that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=481.82000000000005s)]
*  the Proud Boys' role on January 6th was more furtive than the Oath Keepers, but also more [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=485.70000000000005s)]
*  violent and momentous. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=489.90000000000003s)]
*  Just one among the 21 accused Oath Keepers who have been charged with assaulting a police [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=491.86s)]
*  officer, for instance, where many of the Proud Boys have been. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=496.02000000000004s)]
*  What's their connection, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=500.3s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=504.66s)]
*  They're kind of two disparate ideas. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=505.66s)]
*  The Oath Keepers were created shortly after Barack Obama took office, the idea that you [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=507.3s)]
*  have to keep an oath to defend the rule in the United States. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=512.5400000000001s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=517.1800000000001s)]
*  The Proud Boys were created during the Trump era. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=518.1800000000001s)]
*  The Proud Boys are like a militant street gang, basically, that was created to fight [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=519.76s)]
*  back against what they believed to be leftist violence in the streets. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=524.5s)]
*  And that's why they were constantly in these racial justice protests, trying to stir up [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=528.1800000000001s)]
*  more agitation. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=534.46s)]
*  The Proud Boys are inherently a more violent group. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=535.82s)]
*  It takes getting into a physical fight to be initiated as a high-level Proud Boy. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=538.46s)]
*  Whereas the Oath Keepers were planning a much larger thing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=544.14s)]
*  They are largely filled with people who are ex-military, ex-police, and they had a plan. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=546.9000000000001s)]
*  These people were wearing earpieces and talked to each other in the day. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=554.22s)]
*  And they had this idea for QRF squads, which are basically bringing ammo in, bringing weapons [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=557.5s)]
*  in later in the day that they had stored at their hotel room. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=563.5s)]
*  So one was, you know, the Proud Boys are basically just like a street gang waiting to fight on [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=567.74s)]
*  command. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=572.62s)]
*  And the Oath Keepers were kind of a military. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=573.62s)]
*  Those are the two big differences there. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=575.62s)]
*  One of the things in your piece that was interesting is you talk about how the revelation of details [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=577.1s)]
*  from the House Committee's investigation comes as federal law enforcement agencies remain [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=581.4000000000001s)]
*  on alert for domestic terrorism. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=585.86s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security issued an advisory Monday saying that the U.S. remains [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=588.0600000000001s)]
*  in a heightened threat environment fueled by several factors, including an online environment [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=592.22s)]
*  filled with false or misleading narratives and conspiracy theories and other forms of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=597.3s)]
*  mis, dis, and malinformation, or MDM, introduced and or amplified by foreign and domestic threat [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=601.58s)]
*  actors. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=608.3s)]
*  So there's a bigger piece to this, which you've been studying for years, that is enveloping [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=609.3s)]
*  this current matter. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=614.66s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to some people on the committee, some investigators on the committee about [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=615.66s)]
*  this, and they are similarly worried about this. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=620.4599999999999s)]
*  And I might end up in whatever report they wind up producing that'll be like a Mueller [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=622.54s)]
*  report or a Warren commission at the end of the day. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=626.26s)]
*  But they are really worried about this anti-elite sentiment that is being pushed by these groups [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=629.26s)]
*  that used to be pretty separate. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=635.86s)]
*  The Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the QAnon people, the anti-vax community, they're kind [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=637.3399999999999s)]
*  of coalescing. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=641.6999999999999s)]
*  All of them seem to think there is a new world order out to get them. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=643.0999999999999s)]
*  All of them seem to think that there is this hand above the United States government that [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=646.14s)]
*  is pushing people down. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=652.38s)]
*  The parallels in history to this are very scary. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=655.98s)]
*  This is the stuff that you get before very grim times in history. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=659.42s)]
*  It's deeply anti-Semitic, it's deeply racist. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=664.02s)]
*  That's how you get to this moment. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=666.74s)]
*  But all of them are coalescing around this. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=669.22s)]
*  You see this in Europe with the anti-vax protests over there that are a little bit more violent [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=670.9s)]
*  than the ones that have been here. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=675.66s)]
*  You see that in Canada with the trucker congoy right now. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=677.1s)]
*  This is a global movement of, I think they want it to be called populism, but it's a [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=681.74s)]
*  global movement of anti-elitism, anti-authoritarianism, sorry, anti-authority in general, pro-authoritarianism. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=687.8199999999999s)]
*  It's basically anarchy. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=695.38s)]
*  And that's what they are rooting for so they can reinstitute a system, a revenge system, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=696.8199999999999s)]
*  that works better for them. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=700.86s)]
*  And it is not easily discounted because of the way it's spreading around the world. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=702.34s)]
*  You can't now just sort of shove it into a corner and ignore it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=706.46s)]
*  So I appreciate the reporting that you're doing on this. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=708.9399999999999s)]
*  Ben Collins is a senior reporter for NBC News. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=710.66s)]
*  We always appreciate your time, my friend. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=713.22s)]
*  And then there is Wisconsin, which Rolling Stone this week called ground zero for the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=716.34s)]
*  MAGA effort to steal the next election. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=721.34s)]
*  Quote, Republicans convinced Trump won are pushing to decertify his 2020 loss and lay [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=724.46s)]
*  the groundwork to overturn the next election if it doesn't go their way. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=730.4s)]
*  End quote. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=734.72s)]
*  Republicans in Wisconsin have been moving toward a legislative takeover of the state's [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  elections, potentially putting the power to decide election outcomes in the hands of the [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=740.12s)]
*  Republican legislature. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=746.16s)]
*  They've also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars funding an investigation into the [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=748.4s)]
*  2020 election run by a guy who says the election was stolen and who hired former Trump officials [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=752.64s)]
*  to be his investigators. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=758.64s)]
*  And the thing to know about Wisconsin is that they've got an election coming up one week [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=761.4s)]
*  from today. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=766.0s)]
*  Primaries that could have huge implications for the midterm elections later this year [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=768.04s)]
*  and the 2024 presidential elections, because next week's elections are for local offices [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=771.3599999999999s)]
*  all across the state and stop the steal election. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=777.2399999999999s)]
*  Conspiracists are running in a number of them. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=781.16s)]
*  Now Wisconsin has the most decentralized election system of any state. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=784.2399999999999s)]
*  The elections are run by nearly 2000 clerks at the local municipal level, which means [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=788.52s)]
*  that local elections in Wisconsin can have an outsize impact on how elections are actually [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=793.56s)]
*  run. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=799.16s)]
*  And with one week to go until those elections, what are Wisconsin Democrats? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=800.24s)]
*  And when I say Democrats, I mean both big D Democrats and small D Democrats, people [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=803.8s)]
*  who are in favor of democracy, doing to protect that democracy in the state of Wisconsin. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=808.24s)]
*  Joining us now, Ben Wickler. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=815.04s)]
*  He's the chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=816.04s)]
*  Mr. Wickler, good to see you. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=818.56s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=819.76s)]
*  We've tried our best to explain the complexities, the differences in Wisconsin that some of [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=821.12s)]
*  our viewers may have from their own state. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=826.08s)]
*  But this occurrence of these stop the steal advocates at the local level is disconcerting [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=828.62s)]
*  for a number of reasons. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=834.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=836.08s)]
*  And I'm so glad that you're covering this. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=837.68s)]
*  I'm glad to be with you. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=839.52s)]
*  Wisconsin was the tipping point state in 2016 and 2020. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=841.4s)]
*  It's the state that handed the presidency first to Trump, I'm sorry to say, and then [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=844.9599999999999s)]
*  to Joe Biden. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=848.88s)]
*  And in 2022, we're going to elect our governor who ultimately certifies the state's election [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=850.4s)]
*  results in November. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=855.36s)]
*  If Governor Evers is reelected, he will continue his vow to protect the right to vote and make [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=857.34s)]
*  sure our elections are secure. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=862.4s)]
*  The Republicans running like Rebecca Clayfish has refused to rule out signing bills that [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=865.64s)]
*  would put the state legislature in charge of deciding who won. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=869.6s)]
*  And what happens in November in that all important governor's race will be shaped by what happens [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=873.84s)]
*  in Wisconsin in these local spring elections. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=878.78s)]
*  You have people like Melinda Eck, who organized a stop the steal protest outside of City Hall [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=881.96s)]
*  in Green Bay, our third largest city in our state. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=886.88s)]
*  She's running for city council on a slate of conspiracy theorists, stop the stealers [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=890.16s)]
*  in that city. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=895.4s)]
*  The primary is coming up in one week and we are organizing the living daylights out of [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=896.68s)]
*  these local races because they're often decided by just a few votes. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=901.4s)]
*  If you get on the phone right now and call voters in Green Bay, you can help turn out [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=905.6999999999999s)]
*  the voters who make sure that the stop the steal team doesn't take over that city's city [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=909.4s)]
*  council, which has enormous control over the municipal clerk who administers the election, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=915.04s)]
*  the budget for election administration, and a dozen other things. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=920.7s)]
*  You make an interesting point here because I'd be thinking for my municipal elections, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=923.86s)]
*  I'd be looking for candidates who are going to deal with policing and roads and schools [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=927.02s)]
*  and garbage collection and things like that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=931.82s)]
*  So why would anybody care to vote for somebody who's a stop the steal advocate? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=934.1s)]
*  But your point is valid that turnout for local elections is very, very low. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=937.58s)]
*  So the ability to win in a local election can be with very few voters. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=941.5600000000001s)]
*  This is the thing. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=947.6s)]
*  Wisconsin elections over and over come down to a hair's breadth. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=948.6s)]
*  Four out of the last six presidential elections here came down to less than one percentage [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=952.0200000000001s)]
*  point. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=955.98s)]
*  Our governor's race in 2018, Governor Evers was elected with a 1.1 percentage point margin. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=956.98s)]
*  That's two or three voters per precinct in our state. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=962.5s)]
*  If you look at De Pere, Wisconsin, it's a smaller city. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=966.0400000000001s)]
*  Kelly Rue is one of the fraudulent electors. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=969.82s)]
*  She's on the city council in De Pere. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=972.3000000000001s)]
*  She was just subpoenaed by the January 6th committee and she's running for reelection. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=974.0600000000001s)]
*  Anything against her is a candidate who is actually a poll worker who believes in free [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=978.1s)]
*  and fair and secure elections. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=982.14s)]
*  So these races could shape whether voters are turned away, whether if someone has an [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=983.98s)]
*  error on their absentee ballot, they get a phone call about it so they can fix it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=989.3000000000001s)]
*  That can shape statewide outcomes and statewide outcomes in Wisconsin can shape national outcomes [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=993.38s)]
*  in 2024. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=998.38s)]
*  If we want to stop the coup in 2024, we've got to obsess over local elections right now. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=999.38s)]
*  I want to underscore this point because you're saying this caused Ezra Klein to write an [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1004.9399999999999s)]
*  op-ed for the New York Times in which he cited you saying if you want to fight for the future [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1010.18s)]

*  democracy. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1018.3s)]
*  These local races that determine the mechanics of American democracy are the ventilation [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1019.42s)]
*  shaft in the Republican Death Star. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1026.3s)]
*  These races get zero national attention. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1029.1399999999999s)]
*  They hardly get local attention. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1031.72s)]
*  Turnout is often lower than 20%, which means people who actually engage have a superpower. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1034.1s)]
*  The point you're making tonight, the point that our viewers have to hear wherever they [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1041.8999999999999s)]
*  live in the country, particularly if they live in Wisconsin, is that you've got that [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1045.2199999999998s)]
*  superpower literally registering to vote, literally showing up to vote. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1049.1399999999999s)]
*  Attending school board meetings, attending city council meetings, and knowing who's on [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1054.2199999999998s)]
*  the ballot could be the mechanism for saving democracy in this country. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1057.6599999999999s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1063.1s)]
*  And I want to underscore something. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1064.62s)]
*  No matter where you live in the country, you can join our virtual phone banks. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1066.3999999999999s)]
*  We're calling voters all this weekend, and we'll be calling them through the primaries [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1070.5s)]
*  on February 15th through the local elections on April 5th. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1074.12s)]
*  If you go to wisdems.org slash volunteer, you can sign up and volunteers across the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1077.3799999999999s)]
*  country can make those reminder calls. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1082.08s)]
*  We don't need to persuade hardcore Trumpists to vote for pro-democracy candidates. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1084.1799999999998s)]
*  If we just remind people who voted for Joe Biden in Wisconsin in 2020 that there are [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1089.34s)]
*  local elections coming up in the next few weeks, that can make all the difference. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1093.62s)]
*  And if they vote this spring, they're definitely voting this fall. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1097.82s)]
*  So you're helping throw out Ron Johnson and reelecting Governor Evers at the same time. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1100.22s)]
*  It's such a powerful act, and it's extra powerful because so few people on either side do it. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1104.54s)]
*  Right-wing talk radio right now in Wisconsin is pushing these slates of candidates like [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1109.86s)]
*  that are opposed to our democracy. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1114.8s)]
*  And we need to organize harder than they are. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1117.9199999999998s)]
*  We have to care about it more. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1120.6399999999999s)]
*  Whoever works harder in these elections wins. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1122.36s)]
*  They're not millions of dollars of TV ads. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1125.12s)]
*  It's just person after person making phone calls when it gets a little warmer, knocking [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1127.0s)]
*  on doors. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1131.48s)]
*  That work will determine what happens in our democracy at the local level, which scales [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1132.74s)]
*  up to the whole country. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1136.56s)]
*  I'm going to pause and leave it there because that is the point that I think people have [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1137.56s)]
*  to understand. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1142.28s)]
*  Thanks for making it so strongly. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1143.76s)]
*  Ben Wicklars, the chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, we appreciate your time. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOsWa00LgfE&t=1144.76s)]
