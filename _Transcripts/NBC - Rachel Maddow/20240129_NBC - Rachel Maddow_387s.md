# Why E. Jean Carroll's legal defeat of Donald Trump matters
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk)
*  It is a civil case between two very identifiable, very unique individuals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=0.0s)]
*  And as such, there are two ways this has resonated so much with all of us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=8.5s)]
*  There's two reasons why we care so much about what she has just been able to do. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=12.8s)]
*  The first reason, the first reason it resonates, the first reason we care, honestly, is because [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  of us as a country and who we are and the way he as a political figure is trying to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=25.28s)]
*  change us as a country. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=31.76s)]
*  You are promising America tonight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=35.72s)]
*  You would never abuse power as retribution against anybody. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=37.86s)]
*  Except for day one. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=42.68000000000001s)]
*  Except for? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  Look, he's going crazy. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  Except for day one. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=45.96s)]
*  Meaning? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=46.96s)]
*  I said I want to be a dictator for one day. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=47.96s)]
*  Sean, I only want to be a dictator for one day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  Would you rather have four years of Donald Trump as a dictator or four years of Joe Biden [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=54.64s)]
*  as a president? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=59.24s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=60.24s)]
*  As a dictator? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=61.24s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=62.24s)]
*  Sometimes in life, we all need a good paddling from the principle to set our life on the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=63.24s)]
*  right track. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=70.6s)]
*  And this country does need a little bit of that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=72.76s)]
*  We need a little paddling. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=75.36s)]
*  It's nice to have a strong man running your country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=76.36s)]
*  Would you rather have four years of Donald Trump as a dictator or four years of Joe Biden [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=78.48s)]
*  as a president? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=83.4s)]
*  I'd rather have Donald Trump all the way. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  Even as a dictator? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=86.2s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=87.2s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=88.2s)]
*  As a dictator. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=89.2s)]
*  I think I'm choosing Donald Trump as a dictator. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=90.2s)]
*  I'm going dictator Trump for sure. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=91.92s)]
*  I'd rather have Donald Trump as a dictator. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=93.72s)]
*  The other day Donald Trump said on his first day he's going to be a dictator for a day. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=95.12s)]
*  I like that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=98.68s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=99.68s)]
*  Would you rather have Donald Trump as a dictator for four years or reelect Joe Biden for four [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=100.68s)]
*  years? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=104.44s)]
*  I would rather have Donald Trump. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=105.44s)]
*  I'd like them to see the repeal of the Roosevelt law so that he can be a president for a lot [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  more than four years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=112.48s)]
*  But we, this country needs a dictator. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=113.48s)]
*  I hate to say that, but it's the truth. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=116.16s)]
*  This is part of why we care, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=120.24s)]
*  Because putting him in court tests this whole idea. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=123.88s)]
*  What is appealing about a dictator? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=127.8s)]
*  What is a dictatorship, right? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=129.76s)]
*  What is appealing about a strong man leader replacing democracy? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=131.24s)]
*  Having somebody who just stays in power indefinitely and has unchecked total authority to do whatever [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=135.96s)]
*  he wants. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=140.68s)]
*  What is appealing about that? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=142.36s)]
*  Not just why would you offer to be that? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=145.44000000000003s)]
*  You can see the appeal to a person who wants to be that kind of person, but why would you [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=147.12s)]
*  want that in your country? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=150.56s)]
*  The most appealing thing about a strong man leader, right, is that he'd be able to get [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=153.84s)]
*  stuff done. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=157.94000000000003s)]
*  He'd be unconstrained, couldn't be stopped, you know? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=158.94000000000003s)]
*  I alone can fix it through enforcing loyalty to him or death by locking up his enemies, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=162.52s)]
*  by breaking all the rules, you know, government shmoverment, congress shmongress. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=170.64s)]
*  The courts, yeah, yeah, right, them and what army? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=175.16s)]
*  That's what he is promising. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=178.55999999999997s)]
*  That's the appeal. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  And so what this writer, this journalist, this extraordinary unique woman did was give [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=181.27999999999997s)]
*  us pretty much the first test of that prospect that has come all the way to fruition. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=186.55999999999997s)]
*  This has run to the end now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  This is the test. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=195.64s)]
*  Is he the strong man that he claims to be and that his followers believe him to be and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=196.64s)]
*  that they so want, instead of this messy democracy where sometimes other people get their way, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=201.72s)]
*  is he that? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=206.48s)]
*  Or is he a citizen, an American who lives in a democracy which has courts and laws? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=209.17999999999998s)]
*  A would-be strong man says he is immune from the legal system. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=215.2s)]
*  He is unconstrained by any institution and by anything in our government. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=219.32s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll is the one who called that question. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=224.96s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll's civil case says, I'm not a strong man and neither are you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=228.12s)]
*  None of us are. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=236.72s)]
*  No one can be in America because this is a democracy and the law and a case like this, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  she says, the law protects me, even from you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=244.44s)]
*  And so I will call the question. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=250.14000000000001s)]
*  I will call on the law, the court system, to show that, to prove that the strong man [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=251.72s)]
*  model does not work here however much people might want it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=257.08s)]
*  This is not Europe between the wars. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=261.88s)]
*  This is America. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=263.96s)]
*  And that's the second reason that we care, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=268.76s)]
*  That's the second reason this case, this huge $83 million judgment resonates so much with [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=271.84s)]
*  us. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=276.16s)]
*  Because she did this in a civil case, human to human, eyeball to eyeball, she did this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=278.0s)]
*  in her own name and in her own personal defense. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=282.56s)]
*  She called upon the law to protect her, a named person who was willing to put her name [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=286.88s)]
*  to the allegations and to show up in court and say it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=292.36s)]
*  So much of the calculus in our country right now, so much of the calculus, frankly, in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=297.28s)]
*  the world right now, so much of the calculus about how to contend with Trump is, oh, how [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=301.12s)]
*  mad is he going to be? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=306.04s)]
*  How crazy will his supporters go? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=307.72s)]
*  In historian Tim Snyder's seminal book on tyranny, this anticipation of the backlash, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  this worry about how upset Trump and his supporters might get, this is a phenomenon that Snyder [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=318.32000000000005s)]
*  describes as obeying in advance, as in do not obey in advance. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  Do not give the tyrant or the would-be tyrant what they want because you fear what they [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  might do otherwise. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=335.08s)]
*  Put more bluntly, the message is, to Snyder's lights, the lesson from the 20th century is, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=338.68s)]
*  stand up, say no, have guts. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=346.44s)]
*  Be the one. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=350.08s)]
*  How many of us would have the guts of E. Jean Carroll at age 80 to do what she did, to call [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  to test it, to make us decide it as a country, to render this would-be strongman just a man? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eap-5uu6pMk&t=358.4s)]
