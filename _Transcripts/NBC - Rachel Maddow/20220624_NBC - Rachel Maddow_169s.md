# Trump Had More Than One Inroad Into The Justice Department
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s)
*  Now, to the other point around the fake-electors scheme, the other, I thought, really important [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=0.0s)]
*  revelation that came out today in the hearing that we did not know before is that Trump [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=4.76s)]
*  had more than one inroad into the Justice Department. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=10.4s)]
*  He had Jeffrey Clark, but he also had another man named Ken Klikowski. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=13.8s)]
*  Ken came to the Justice Department just 35 days before the inauguration. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=18.2s)]
*  He came in the middle of December, right around the time that Bill Barr was leaving. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=22.32s)]
*  And had previously, in that time between the election and his abrival at the Justice [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=27.2s)]
*  Department, worked with Eastman, the lawyer who was working on the fake-electors scheme. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=31.46s)]
*  And he had worked with him before coming to DOJ. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=38.28s)]
*  The committee made clear that those connections were really important, including by taking [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=41.2s)]
*  another look at that Georgia letter and pointing out that further down in the letter, you see [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=45.4s)]
*  some of that rhetoric around fake-electors. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  The letter that Jeffrey Clark wanted sent to Georgia not only says falsely that the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=52.84s)]
*  Justice Department thought that the election might have been rigged in Georgia, but that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=56.72s)]
*  it would be an opportunity for the state of Georgia to take another look and figure out [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=60.48s)]
*  whether or not a new slate of electors would need to be submitted. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=64.8s)]
*  Katie, do you know who installed Klikowski at the Justice Department? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=68.44s)]
*  It seems pretty clear, at least the way that the investigation is describing it, that he [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=72.64s)]
*  was kind of the Eastman carrier pigeon, the Eastman-Trump plan about how to overthrow [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=76.88s)]
*  the government. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=82.36s)]
*  He was essentially a spokesman for that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=83.64s)]
*  He was an actor for that within the Justice Department. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  The timing of him getting there is so strange. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=89.72s)]
*  Do you know who put him in there? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=91.84s)]
*  Well, previously, he'd been at the Office of Management and Budget at the White House, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  working under the Trump administration. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  Nobody is really sure, and I've spoken to lots of officials from that era, and many [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=99.28s)]
*  of them cannot remember Ken Klikowski. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=102.88s)]
*  In fact, the Senate Judiciary Committee asked people about Ken Klikowski, the House Oversight [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=105.64s)]
*  Committee, the committee who was working on this investigation before the select committee [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=110.72s)]
*  was formed also asked witnesses about Ken Klikowski. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=115.36s)]
*  It's clear they could see his name in emails. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=118.27999999999999s)]
*  But many, many people didn't even know that he existed within the department. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=121.0s)]
*  But to your point, the committee showed another set of correspondence that shows that Eastman [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=123.96s)]
*  was very aware of Klikowski's presence inside of the department and that he did not want [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=129.16s)]
*  to highlight that presence because Ken was very new there and he didn't necessarily want [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=134.04s)]
*  people to know that he was at the department. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=138.28s)]
*  We needed to protect his cover. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=140.24s)]
*  It was a variation of that idea. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzqb9ibqc4s&t=141.76s)]
