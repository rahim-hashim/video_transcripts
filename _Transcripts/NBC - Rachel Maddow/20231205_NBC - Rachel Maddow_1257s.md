# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Dec. 4
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk)
*  So here's the thing about tonight's show. I disagree with Liz Cheney about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=0.0s)]
*  everything. My whole adult life on everything in politics, I would not just [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=7.16s)]
*  say that Liz Cheney and I were on different proverbial teams, I would say [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=13.4s)]
*  we are from different proverbial planets and they are planets that are mostly at [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=17.7s)]
*  war with each other. And she's a politician, I'm not a politician, I'm [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=23.04s)]
*  just a person, but I am definitely a liberal and she is definitely a hardcore [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=28.0s)]
*  conservative and I disagree with Liz Cheney on like really on everything you [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=33.36s)]
*  can think of on the environment, on abortion rights profoundly. I think she's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=39.6s)]
*  not just wrong on abortion, she is capital W wrong on abortion in a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  terrible way. I disagree with her vehemently on voting rights and on the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=49.68s)]
*  Iraq war and the Afghanistan war and our relationship or lack thereof with [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=55.28s)]
*  Iran and our approach to terrorism and torture and guns and like mining and [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=60.44s)]
*  intellectual property and the rules of the House of Representatives. Honestly I [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=67.2s)]
*  once even got mad at Liz Cheney about fishing and it's the one thing you think [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=72.08s)]
*  we'd have in common, right? Even on fishing I got mad at her about something. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=76.44s)]
*  We are opposites and again in some ways this is funny and dumb but it is also I [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=80.8s)]
*  have to tell you in being truly honest it has been a serious thing to me. It has [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=89.88s)]
*  been part of how I understand myself in my political time as an American that I [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=96.96s)]
*  am someone fundamentally opposed to the politics of Liz Cheney and her father [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=102.32s)]
*  Dick Cheney who was White House Chief of Staff and Defense Secretary before he [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  was Vice President and what I still believe was the fundamentally disastrous [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=110.68s)]
*  George W Bush administration in which Liz Cheney also served. I literally [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=114.12s)]
*  started writing books in the first place more than a decade ago because I had so [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=118.48s)]
*  much to get off my chest about what I thought was wrong with the Cheney family [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=123.6s)]
*  approach to war and foreign policy. The first book I ever wrote was inspired by [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=128.12s)]
*  Dick Cheney's minority report in the Iran Contra scandal during the Reagan [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=132.32s)]
*  administration. That first book I ever wrote is literally dedicated to him. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=136.52s)]
*  To former Vice President Dick Cheney, oh please let me interview you. And that feeling [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  extended to his daughter who is his political descendant both literally and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=147.4s)]
*  proverbially in every way. And you want one more level of it? There's one more [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  level of it. As dedicated as Liz Cheney is to her father, Dick Cheney, they [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=158.84s)]
*  are profoundly close as father and daughter. She was profoundly loyal to him. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=165.04s)]
*  There is not room for a piece of paper to slide between them on policy. As close [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  as they are, as much as she reveres her dad, I feel the same way about my dad. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=173.56s)]
*  I wear one piece of jewelry. I wear my dad's high school ring. My dad is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=180.16s)]
*  brilliant and kind and as far as I can tell he is right about absolutely [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=186.44s)]
*  everything. He's an Air Force veteran. He's a very careful lawyer and my whole [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=190.96s)]
*  life my dad was kind of the soul of moderation when it came to politics [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=196.68s)]
*  until Liz's dad. The Dick Cheney vice presidency had the effect of an almost [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=201.84s)]
*  religious conversion on my own dad, moving his politics what seemed to be [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=208.56s)]
*  about 50 points west of where they had ever been before. So vehemently did he [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=212.88s)]
*  object, as did I, to Cheney brand republicanism during the George W. Bush [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=218.28s)]
*  era. So it's weird. I think the Cheney family is the biggest [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=223.6s)]
*  touchstone that I have in American politics in my lifetime. It is a funny [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=229.8s)]
*  thing but it's also personal and real and it is a thing that matters to me and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=234.96s)]
*  I say this tonight not for the just the gee whiz factor of me having Liz Cheney [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=240.56s)]
*  here tonight. Me having somebody here tonight who you'd never expect. I say [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=247.2s)]
*  this not for just the you know man bites dog weirdness of this. I say it because I [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=250.96s)]
*  think in civic terms and sort of American citizenship terms I think it's [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=257.6s)]
*  really important how much we disagree. It's important how far apart we are in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=261.92s)]
*  every policy issue imaginable. It is important that Liz Cheney is infinity [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=266.8s)]
*  and I am negative infinity on the ideological number line. It's important [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=271.0s)]
*  because that tells you how serious and big something has to be to put us to put [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=275.56s)]
*  me and Liz Cheney together on the same side of something in American life. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=280.88s)]
*  It's also valuable to have a conservative Republican member of Congress [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=288.76s)]
*  writing about something we can't see from the outside. What's going on among [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=291.76s)]
*  conservative Republicans behind closed doors while they're giving in to this [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  anti-democratic plot. We learned for example on page 124 of Liz Cheney's new [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=301.04s)]
*  book that a senior Republican staffer on the Rules Committee wrote in the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  Republican staff memo on impeachment less than a week after the January 6th [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=310.12s)]
*  attack on Congress. This is the Republican staff memo. The person wrote [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  that Trump had committed impeachable offenses calling what Trump did quote a [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=318.56s)]
*  serious act political in nature that corrupted or subverted the political [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=322.48s)]
*  process and threatened the order of political society. That's the Republican [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=326.56s)]
*  staff memo on impeachment after January 6th. Previously unreported. We learn on [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=331.56s)]
*  page 74 that the day before January 6th Kevin McCarthy's general counsel the top [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=337.96s)]
*  lawyer for the top Republican in the House told Congressman Mike Johnson that [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=343.28s)]
*  the effort he was organizing to get House Republicans to sign on to Trump's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=349.04s)]
*  effort to overthrow the election was an effort that was wildly unconstitutional [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=352.56s)]
*  in its basis. Quote later that night I heard from Kevin McCarthy's chief [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=357.16s)]
*  counsel Michaela Carr. She told me she had made clear to Mike Johnson that his [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=361.0s)]
*  letter was wrong. She said that he knew it was. She said he pushed back very [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=365.52s)]
*  strongly. Excuse me. She said she pushed back very strongly when they discussed [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=370.12s)]
*  it that afternoon. And then Cheney quotes from an email. He knows he is [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=374.56s)]
*  wrong on the fundamental constitutional principle and his argument that he has [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=379.64s)]
*  some sort of power to individually determine absent due process of any sort [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  that a state didn't meet their constitutional obligation and then that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=386.92s)]
*  the remedy should be that without any process whatsoever the federal [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  Congress gets to overturn the will of the people is astonishing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=394.32s)]
*  Astonishing that's the top lawyer serving the top Republican in the House [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=400.68s)]
*  telling him that what he's doing is unconstitutional as he's doing it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=407.56s)]
*  Mike Johnson of course is now no longer just an anonymous backbench member of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  Congress. He's now the leader. He's now the Republican speaker of the House. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=416.48s)]
*  Page 32 of her book Liz Cheney describes communications with senior Republican [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=421.0s)]
*  staffers on Capitol Hill about the court filing that Mike Johnson in fact led as [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=425.32000000000005s)]
*  part of Trump's election challenge concluding that he might personally have [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=430.88s)]
*  ethical issues as a lawyer as in with his professional accreditation for having [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=435.24s)]
*  made factual assertions to the court in that brief about things he didn't [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=440.68s)]
*  actually have factually in factual information about. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=444.68s)]
*  As you know lots of Trump lawyers have faced professional punishment for lies [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=449.8s)]
*  they told on Trump's behalf after the election. Liz Cheney in her new book [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  effectively asserts that the House Speaker Mike Johnson might be one of [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=457.48s)]
*  those lawyers. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=461.48s)]
*  On page 228 she says Congressman Jim Jordan who was very nearly speaker [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  himself she says he may need the assistance of a criminal lawyer for [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=468.88s)]
*  sorting out the conflicting claims he made during congressional testimony [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=473.0s)]
*  about his communications with former President Trump while the January 6th [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  attack was underway. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=480.16s)]
*  On page 18 of her book Jim Jordan gets this from Liz Cheney quote Jordan did [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=482.76000000000005s)]
*  make a memorable pitch to me to join the group. It went something like this. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=487.8s)]
*  Would you consider joining the Freedom Caucus? We don't have any women and we [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=492.28s)]
*  need one. Cheney says tempting as this offer was I took a pass. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=496.28s)]
*  On page 153 here's Liz Cheney's goodbye to Congresswoman Elise Stefanik quote [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  other members said they were upset that my impeachment vote had caused them [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=508.96s)]
*  trouble at home. They thought I should have provided them cover for their votes [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=511.67999999999995s)]
*  against impeachment. I had heard this complaint from an angry Elise Stefanik [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=514.88s)]
*  of New York. She told me that because of my vote to impeach people were writing [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  letters to the editor of her local newspapers criticizing her and asking [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=522.92s)]
*  why she hadn't taken the same principled stand that I had. Cheney says quote that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=526.6s)]
*  seemed less my problem than hers. Many of us who had known Elise Stefanik since [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=532.92s)]
*  before she abandoned all principle were curious about how she had lost her sense [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=538.48s)]
*  of right and wrong. Cheney says a number of the men who spoke in favor of removing [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=543.12s)]
*  me from leadership said they didn't like my tone. I wasn't contrite enough nor [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=549.36s)]
*  had I learned my lesson. Ralph Norman of South Carolina kept repeating that his [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=554.0400000000001s)]
*  problem with me was my attitude. You've just got such a defiant attitude. A [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=558.08s)]
*  couple of my male colleagues were so enraged by my unwillingness to [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=562.72s)]
*  apologize that they got themselves really worked up and seemed on the verge [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=566.32s)]
*  of tears as they lectured me. I tried to follow what the most emotional members [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=569.7600000000001s)]
*  were saying but it wasn't always easy. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania for example [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=574.12s)]
*  seemed angry because I had released a statement before I voted. In an effort to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=578.48s)]
*  describe how upset he was, Mike Kelly said it's like you're playing in the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=582.92s)]
*  biggest game of your life and you look up and see your girlfriend sitting on [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=586.52s)]
*  the opponent's side. Cheney says these were grown men. This was 2021. I was [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=590.32s)]
*  standing at the podium at the front of the auditorium thinking you've got to be [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=597.8s)]
*  kidding me. Other female members started yelling she's not your girlfriend. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=601.64s)]
*  Yeah I said I'm not your girlfriend. She really isn't truly. They're so upset [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=608.24s)]
*  about her tone and about her not taking their feelings into account but she [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=615.44s)]
*  doesn't take their feelings into account. She is relentless. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=620.0s)]
*  Let me ask you about a moment in your book that happens on January 4th. It's [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=624.84s)]
*  described in chapter 9 of your book and you describe listening in on a call in [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=630.12s)]
*  which Trump lawyers are briefing what we call surrogates. Basically people are [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=634.72s)]
*  going to go on TV and talk about the pro-Trump side of things. And on that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=638.96s)]
*  call, Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis describes what they're envisioning for January 6th. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=641.96s)]
*  She says the way you write it is in the scenario Ellis described when Pence was [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=646.64s)]
*  presiding he could either refuse to open or refuse to count the electoral votes. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=651.12s)]
*  They don't necessarily know you're on this call. You're listening in. It's two [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=655.76s)]
*  days before January 6th. Was that the moment when it really became clear to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=660.88s)]
*  you in detail what they were going to try to do? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=664.8s)]
*  Yes. You know I had heard obviously there had been talk about we're going to have [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=668.12s)]
*  these electors meet. I think Stephen Miller had been talking about that but [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=673.04s)]
*  it wasn't clear to me what the contours of this particular part of the plan were [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=677.08s)]
*  until I dialed into that phone call and listening to them describe how these fake [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=684.28s)]
*  electors were going to be used and the fact that they anticipated that Vice [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=690.72s)]
*  President Pence was going to use them to refuse to count the legitimate electors [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=695.64s)]
*  was certainly a moment of intense concern and as I got off that call I ran [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=700.6800000000001s)]
*  into the Capitol into the office of the parliamentarian of the House to say you [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=707.48s)]
*  know wait a minute this is what I'm hearing is going to happen. What do we do [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  about it in the joint session? How do we stop this? It was very clear that there [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=716.6800000000001s)]
*  were not a lot of good answers to that because I knew I learned later through [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=722.36s)]
*  the investigation that Vice President Pence and his counsel were having [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=726.6400000000001s)]
*  discussions with the Senate parliamentarian and that the Vice President [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=730.12s)]
*  ultimately of course did his duty bravely but if you're in a joint session [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=733.4000000000001s)]
*  of Congress you're not in a position where there are a lot of legislative steps [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=738.9200000000001s)]
*  that you can take except to basically move to adjourn so it was a very [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=743.96s)]
*  dangerous and chilling moment. Liz you focus very early on in the book on the [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=749.5600000000001s)]
*  fact that Trump two days after he lost the election he fired the defense [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=755.08s)]
*  secretary. Why do you think he did that? Why is that important? Well first of all [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=759.9200000000001s)]
*  to have a situation where a president who's lost the election and so we should [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=766.52s)]
*  be going through a transition and a transition is a period of time when the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=771.04s)]
*  United States is particularly potentially vulnerable and especially [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=775.7199999999999s)]
*  the Defense Department you have to have a nonpartisan transition you have to have [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=780.16s)]
*  a situation where people are very focused on what is the good of the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  country and people recognize we may have lost the election but those politics [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=789.5999999999999s)]
*  should not be part of any kind of decisions that are being made [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=793.68s)]
*  especially during a transition period and so to see Donald Trump fire his [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=798.08s)]
*  defense secretary and we know now of course much more about what was [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=802.4000000000001s)]
*  happening at the time I was very concerned at the time he was also [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=807.1600000000001s)]
*  replacing other senior leaders at the department we know now for example that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=810.36s)]
*  he had told Johnny McEntee at one point to ensure that the Secretary of the Army [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=815.0400000000001s)]
*  and the Chief of Staff of the Army knew that if they issued any more statements [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=822.6s)]
*  saying that the US military had no role in our elections that they would be [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=827.3199999999999s)]
*  fired and that's a you know when you combine that with the steps that we know [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=831.48s)]
*  Mike Flynn was urging him to take Mike Flynn was urging be taken publicly [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=836.36s)]
*  things like deploying the military in order to rerun elections in swing [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=840.16s)]
*  states and I think that's one of the real dangers people have to focus on [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=845.0s)]
*  when we think about a potential second Trump administration you will take those [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=848.8399999999999s)]
*  people who were the most radical the most dangerous who had the the proposals [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=853.48s)]
*  that were the most dangerous and he will put them in positions of you know [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=859.04s)]
*  supreme power and that's that is that that's a risk that we simply can't take [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=862.88s)]
*  one of the other things that you've talked about in terms of a second round [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=867.84s)]
*  and whether or not January 6 was sort of a dress rehearsal or first effort and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=873.6800000000001s)]
*  they'll be better at it the second time around is the prospect that after the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=877.16s)]
*  2024 election maybe Republicans will still be in control in the House maybe [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=881.52s)]
*  Mike Johnson would still be speaker given what Mike Johnson did in an in [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=886.32s)]
*  around in and around the 2020 election what is the risk in terms of him [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=892.24s)]
*  potentially still being speaker of the House him controlling the House of [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=896.6s)]
*  Representatives in the aftermath of the next election you know it is it's it's [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=899.8000000000001s)]
*  terrifying and and I say that with no no pleasure it pains me that that's where [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=905.12s)]
*  we are but you were friends with them I was we were elected the same year our [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=912.36s)]
*  offices were next door to each other and I believed Mike to be a man of principle [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=917.08s)]
*  what I learned was that he was willing to do things he knew to be wrong in order [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=922.44s)]
*  to placate Donald Trump and and again a situation where you have a speaker of [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=928.0s)]
*  the House who is you detailed at the beginning of the show so clearly set [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=932.6s)]
*  aside what he knew to be the facts what he knew to be the law what he knew to be [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=937.36s)]
*  our obligations under the Constitution in order to try to help Donald Trump in [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=941.76s)]
*  his efforts in 2020 we cannot count on on a majority of Republicans on someone [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=947.0s)]
*  like that to do the right thing to uphold the Constitution if for example [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=953.36s)]
*  we had an election that was thrown into the house if nobody got 270 electoral [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=958.88s)]
*  votes so it's it's really serious or if they needed to certify the electoral [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=963.68s)]
*  count yeah I feel like what you describe as a cult of personality was more likely [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=967.4s)]
*  to emerge on the right than on the left because I feel like people on the right [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=976.76s)]
*  have been getting told by the Republican Party my whole adult life that government [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=982.08s)]
*  is the problem like Ronald Reagan said and we need voting restrictions because [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=986.24s)]
*  vote because Democrats cheat and you know that we need unregulated guns not [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  just for hunting and self-defense but because we need to stand up against our [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=997.0s)]
*  government tyranny and all the stuff that maybe works in the short term but [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=999.8s)]
*  in the long term builds toward radicalism and I think opens the right [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=1003.64s)]
*  more up to a cult of personality than the left and I know we probably disagree [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=1007.2s)]
*  I think that's we do disagree on that but what I would say is the way that I look at it is those of us on the right in this moment have a particularly great responsibility and duty because this threat has emerged from the right we can talk about why that was I think that that you know frankly there are millions of people around the country who feel like they aren't heard and and Donald Trump managed to convince them that he would be their voice [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=1012.24s)]
*  you know which is of course a complete lie but they bought it and and he prayed on that patriotism but but right now it's I think partly why I have been so so disappointed with what I've seen from other members of my party in their unwillingness to step up I think we have a particular duty to step up [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=1040.24s)]
*  you look ahead to a year from now heading into the next election cycle if Trump wins Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party and he wins needs back in power what is your life like and what do you think the the noble patriotic righteous fight is to save the country at that point [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=1062.24s)]
*  I don't even want to imagine a situation where he has won I think we have to do everything we can to stop him in terms of again the kinds of things we've been talking about working in a very nonpartisan fashion but I also Rachel think about it from the perspective of my kids and you know there was a moment right after January 6th where I was having dinner with my husband and our two youngest kids who happened to be our sons and and I looked at my sons across the street and I looked at my [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=1082.24s)]
*  husband across the dinner table and and I had this realization you know I grew up in a country where I didn't have to wonder if we were going to have a peaceful transfer of power in the United States and all of a sudden it occurred to me my God maybe they won't be able to say the same thing and and that is why it's so fundamentally important that we we ensure Democrats independents Republicans that we work together we vote together we make clear that Donald Trump is not an acceptable alternative he is not [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=1112.24s)]
*  the lesser of two evils he is a completely unfit man for office he's already shown us what he would do and he can never be near the Oval Office again sounds like you really don't want to think about what resistance or fighting for your country or trying to hold on to democracy looks like with him in power I mean you won't you won't go there well we're going to be successful at making sure that he's not not elected president again let me ask you one last question and I mean this I think with the coming out of [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=1142.24s)]
*  the book and from what I've come to understand about kind of your spirit about these things which is that you know after you got voted out of your Republican leadership job in Washington it was very clear you were going to lose your seat in Congress as well and you didn't quit you decided you were going to make them vote you out and not make it any easier for them but it would have made it a lot easier for you to why did you make that decision I don't I don't think it would have made it easier for you to make that decision [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=1172.24s)]
*  because at the end of the day the question really is you know what's more important here and and to me there was no world in which you would say maintaining this house seat matters more than standing up for truth and it became clear that in order to stay in leadership I was going to have to tell Donald Trump's lies and I wasn't willing to do that but but it wasn't a choice for me and frankly I don't think it's a choice for any American now given the stakes [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=1202.24s)]
*  and given how how significant this threat is. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v-il1d69Fk&t=1232.24s)]
