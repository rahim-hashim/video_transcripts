Video Description: Rachel Maddow shares a moment from Day 2 of Robert Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearing in which Senator Angela Alsobrooks asked him about his idea that Black people should get a different vaccine regimen than white people. Given the pique of the researcher Kennedy cites, he appears to not understand the basis for his argument.

# Trump pick for HHS doubles down on weird racial vaccine theory he apparently misunderstood
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk)
*  Three of the most controversial, most ostentatiously unqualified, sort of the most trolling choices [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump has made for his Cabinet, three of them all had hearings on the same day at the same [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  time today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=9.92s)]
*  At the first of his two confirmation hearings yesterday, Trump's health secretary nominee, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=12.6s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., seemed to not understand what Medicaid is, even though Medicaid ensures [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  roughly a fifth of all Americans and would be among the 13 federal health agencies he [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=22.32s)]
*  would be overseeing if he was confirmed. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=27.0s)]
*  He also suggested that Americans have so many babies that most of the humans born on [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=29.56s)]
*  Earth in any given year are babies that are born in the United States. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=34.44s)]
*  The United States, for the record, has roughly 4 percent of the Earth's population. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=38.92s)]
*  So I don't know how things go at Mr. Kennedy's second hearing today. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=42.56s)]
*  You said the following, and I quote, We should not be giving black people the same vaccine [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=49.84s)]
*  schedule that's given to whites because their immune system is better than ours. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=56.28s)]
*  Can you please explain what you meant? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=62.92s)]
*  There's a series of studies, I think most of them by Poland, that show that, to particular [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  antigens, that blacks have a much stronger reaction. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  There's differences in reaction to different products by different races. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=77.84s)]
*  So I have 17 seconds. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  Let me just ask you then. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=83.4s)]
*  What different vaccine schedule would you say I should have received? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=84.4s)]
*  What different vaccine schedule should I have received? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=90.36s)]
*  I mean, the Poland article suggests that blacks need fewer antigens. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=93.28s)]
*  A series of studies, I think most of them by Poland, that led to some people thinking [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  that maybe Mr. Kennedy was talking to the country of Poland, studies from Poland. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  In fact, he seems to have been referring to one single study by a Dr. Poland, Gregory [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=112.64s)]
*  Poland MD. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=117.32s)]
*  In fact, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made a whole anti-vaccine film targeting black people using [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=118.32s)]
*  that one study from Dr. Poland. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=124.36s)]
*  But poor Dr. Poland, for years, has been telling anybody who will listen that R.F.K. Jr. is [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=126.52s)]
*  completely, totally wrong about his work. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=130.72s)]
*  Dr. Poland says R.F.K. is wildly misrepresenting his research. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=134.4s)]
*  Dr. Poland says, quote, We do not have a study that shows African-Americans need half the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  vaccine dose. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=144.04s)]
*  We do not have a study that shows African-American children are being overdosed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  And please, for the love of God, stop citing my work in your weird anti-vaccine race science [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=150.66s)]
*  theories. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=155.68s)]
*  Get my name out of your mouth. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=157.0s)]
*  Senator also Brooks told Robert F. Kennedy Jr. today that his assertions are dangerous, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=160.72s)]
*  that she'll be voting against his nomination. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azc95pRpDqk&t=164.88s)]
