# New Video Highlights Loudermilk Inconsistencies On Pre-Jan. 6 Tours
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs)
*  Today, the January 6th investigators released this, released video and still images of Republican [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman Barry Loudermilk, in fact, leading that group on an hours-long tour of all three [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=7.12s)]
*  House office buildings on January 5th. Hours in all three office buildings where members of [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=14.4s)]
*  Congress have their offices. And one member of the group strangely takes pictures of things that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=21.6s)]
*  tourists don't typically take pictures of, security checkpoints and hallways and stairways. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=26.56s)]
*  We know that a member of the tour took this picture of the office nameplate outside Jerry [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=33.36s)]
*  Nadler's office. Also this picture of what appears to be a directory listing of Democratic members [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=37.92s)]
*  from the Judiciary Committee, including their photos. Multiple members of this tour group led [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=43.28s)]
*  by Congressman Loudermilk apparently photographed the entrance of a tunnel that leads from the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=48.56s)]
*  Rayburn House Office Building right into the United States Capitol. Why are they all taking [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=53.52s)]
*  pictures of the tunnel? The committee says that multiple participants from Barry Loudermilk's tour, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  including the man who was taking photos of the security checkpoints and the hallways, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=63.6s)]
*  the January 6th investigators say that man and others from the tour then did participate in the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=68.16s)]
*  January 6th events the following day. In fact, the man who was taking the odd pictures of the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=74.16s)]
*  security checkpoints and the hallways and the stairways, according to the investigation, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=79.68s)]
*  he shot this video for Facebook Live on January 6th in which he interacts with a person who he [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=83.84s)]
*  calls our fearless leader. The man shows off how he had modified his flagpole to put what appears [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  to be something sharp at the tip of it, or maybe he's just sharpened at the tip of the pole itself [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  to use it like a spear. The man says it's for a certain person. And the man shooting the video, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  the man from Congressman Loudermilk's tour then says, yeah, that's for somebody special. And he [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=103.68s)]
*  mimes sort of jabbing it into someone. The man from Loudermilk's tour then says on the video that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=108.72s)]
*  they're coming for Jerry Nadler. He repeats Jerry Nadler's name, Congressman Nadler's name, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=114.96s)]
*  a couple of different times. Says they're coming for Jerry Nadler and Chuck Schumer and AOC, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=120.48s)]
*  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and also Nancy Pelosi. He then specifically threatens Pelosi. He seems [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=125.44s)]
*  to be threatening that he's going to tear out her hair if he gets his hands on her. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=130.64s)]
*  The implication of this release from the January 6th investigation today is that members of the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=135.2s)]
*  January 6th mob, including this man who got help in his task, knowingly or unknowingly from [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=139.92s)]
*  Congressman Barry Loudermilk, they apparently prepped and did reconnaissance not just generically [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  for targeting of the Capitol the next day, but for knowing their way around the building, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  the buildings, excuse me, where members of Congress have their actual offices. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=158.72s)]
*  In this guy's case, based on his comments the next day, that was apparently so as to find and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=162.96s)]
*  menace and potentially attack individual members who he was looking for the next day, after having [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=167.76s)]
*  visited where they have their offices the previous day, thanks to Congressman Loudermilk. The man [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=176.56s)]
*  photographs the nameplate outside Jerry Nadler's office on January 5th after Congressman Loudermilk's [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=182.0s)]
*  tour shows him there, and then the next day he's marching toward the Capitol screaming repeatedly [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=186.48s)]
*  about how he's gonna go get Jerry Nadler. So what does this mean? I mean, number one, it means that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=190.88s)]
*  the Democrats led by Mikey Sherrill who raised the alarm that this had happened on January 5th, they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=198.4s)]
*  were apparently right. Number two, interestingly, the committee has apparently interviewed the guy [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=203.04s)]
*  and has photos from his phone that he took during this tour of the House office buildings on January [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=209.04s)]
*  5th. That's interesting. We should note that it appears the committee therefore knows who he is. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=213.6s)]
*  They have identified him and indeed contacted him, but we should also note that as far as we know he [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=219.6s)]
*  has not been arrested or charged with anything related to the attack. Number three, I think we [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=224.32s)]
*  have to ask what the heck with the Capitol police letter sent earlier this week saying, yeah, yeah, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=229.84s)]
*  we looked into it, it all seems fine to us. They said explicitly in their letter that the tour [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=235.6s)]
*  didn't go into the tunnels between the office buildings in the Capitol and didn't go into the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=240.24s)]
*  Capitol itself. Well, the committee shows in fact that the tour included showing off the tunnels [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=244.24s)]
*  and members of the tour taking pictures of the entrances to the tunnels, which is what you'd need [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  to get from those office buildings into the Capitol building. Did the Capitol police actually look into [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=255.44s)]
*  this and why did they screw this up so badly in their public statement about this event? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=260.48s)]
*  But finally, and perhaps most importantly, this is new information about the deliberate targeting [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=268.56s)]
*  of individual members of Congress on January 6th. We previously had video of dudes yelling, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=272.56s)]
*  Nancy, Nancy, while they hunted for Nancy Pelosi's office. We of course have all seen the haunting [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=277.92s)]
*  footage of huge numbers of people in the crowd saying, hang Mike Pence, hang Mike Pence. We [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=282.64s)]
*  have the fact that the rioters in fact were able to find one of the offices for Nancy Pelosi and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=288.4s)]
*  that office was in fact ransacked. But now we've got this new video where, you know, as the dude [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=293.12s)]
*  is advancing on the Capitol, he's talking to a guy with a spear made out of the flagpole about [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=298.16s)]
*  how they're going to use that on a certain someone and then they name individual lawmakers that he [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=303.04s)]
*  says he's coming for. Pelosi, Nadler, Schumer, Ocasio-Cortez. And yes, in the abstract, maybe [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  that sounds like a weird guy fantasizing while he stomps around on the National Mall. But now [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=313.92s)]
*  with context, we know that that same guy the previous day with help from a Republican congressman [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  was apparently casing the office building where those members in fact had their offices, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=324.72s)]
*  documenting the stairways, the hallways, the security checkpoints, and how you might use [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=329.84s)]
*  that underground tunnel to get from that house office building into the Capitol itself, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=333.76s)]
*  taking pictures of Nadler's office door, potentially mapping the way to get to individual [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=338.24s)]
*  congressional offices and also into the Capitol. Thanks for that, Congressman Barry Loudermilk. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=342.56s)]
*  Thanks for that very much. Why did you deny ever giving that tour until you were caught for it? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=349.12s)]
*  And what did you know about the intentions of the people who participated in that tour? When again, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=354.64s)]
*  the Capitol complex was closed to tours. And what did you think the following day on January 6th, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=360.08s)]
*  given what happened at the Capitol, when you knew that you had given a tour the previous day, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=368.48s)]
*  and when Democratic members of Congress raised concerns about those reconnaissance tours have [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=374.08s)]
*  been given? Why didn't you go to the police then? Sir, why won't you go to the committee to talk [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=379.68s)]
*  about this now? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pp2AbzmkJs&t=385.12s)]
