# Contrast in defense secretaries highlights Trump's failure to take staffing government seriously
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc)
*  OK, so he played rugby and he ran track at West Point. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=0.0s)]
*  He also did two master's degrees and got an MBA on top of that. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=4.8s)]
*  Rifle platoon leader, scout platoon leader, then company executive officer, battalion [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=9.72s)]
*  commander and then brigade commander in the 82nd Airborne. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=15.52s)]
*  He helped lead the initial invasion of Baghdad in March 2003. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=18.88s)]
*  He rolled his mechanized division straight from the Kuwait border overland right into [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=23.04s)]
*  the center of Baghdad. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=27.12s)]
*  Won a silver star for his valor in that operation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=28.36s)]
*  Then to Afghanistan, where he led the 10th Mountain Division. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Then he became chief of staff at CENTCOM. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=36.36s)]
*  Then he was the top U.S. commander in the Iraq War, in the whole war. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=39.6s)]
*  He was actually the one who wound down U.S. forces at the end of the Iraq War. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=43.5s)]
*  He was then named vice chief of staff of the United States Army. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=48.36s)]
*  Then he went back to CENTCOM, this time as commander of CENTCOM. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=52.24s)]
*  Then he built and led the force that waged the war against ISIS. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=56.88s)]
*  And then, and only then, was he considered for the really big job, secretary of defense. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=63.88s)]
*  And that is the man who just left office as secretary of defense. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=72.8s)]
*  The man who just arrived to take his job, he was a platoon leader in the National Guard. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=77.56s)]
*  But now he, too, is secretary of defense. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=86.56s)]
*  Both of them, obviously, honorable records of service. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=90.28s)]
*  Not equivalent, though, I think you'd say, in terms of demonstrated leadership, experience, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=94.76s)]
*  complex organizational management experience in particular. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=101.4s)]
*  I mean, four-star general Lloyd Austin had led, like, a whole war or two. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=104.56s)]
*  And he had been chief of staff and then commander at CENTCOM just before being named as defense [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=111.12s)]
*  secretary. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=116.52s)]
*  CENTCOM is the part of the U.S. military that has as its area of responsibility the Middle [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=117.52s)]
*  East and Central Asia and South Asia. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=122.32s)]
*  That was what he was in charge of. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=126.48s)]
*  I mean, that was his experience, heading in to become defense secretary. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=128.12s)]
*  That's who has just left as defense secretary. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=133.72s)]
*  The guy who has just arrived, well, just before he was named as defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  he led one-third of the famous curvy couch on the Fox and Friends Fox News Channel weekend [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=143.44s)]
*  show. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=150.44s)]
*  I have to say, it may be that he led one-fourth of the couch, not one-third. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=151.44s)]
*  I'm not totally sure how many hosts they have, but we could only find these pictures of him [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=155.92s)]
*  sharing with two, so maybe he held down a third. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=159.72s)]
*  That said, prior to his time at the Fox News Channel, Mr. Hegseth also ran into the ground [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=163.16s)]
*  right-wing veterans groups amid allegations, which he denies, of wild financial mismanagement, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=169.4s)]
*  nepotism, sexual harassment, public drunkenness and even drinking on the job. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=176.4s)]
*  For one of those organizations, an independent forensic accountant found evidence of gross [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=181.8s)]
*  financial mismanagement while Pete Hegseth was administering that organization. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=186.4s)]
*  And so then they made him secretary of defense. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=193.28s)]
*  Two guys, same job. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=196.96s)]
*  And you know, maybe he got the job based on merit and demonstrated capability. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=201.72s)]
*  Or maybe it was some other factor. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=208.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=210.96s)]
*  Your call. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=211.96s)]
*  Last night's horrific plane crash at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. was caused [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=215.24s)]
*  by the collision of an American Airlines regional jet carrying 64 people in a flight from Wichita, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  Kansas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  It collided with a U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter that was carrying three crew members. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=226.8s)]
*  And tragically, there appear to have been no survivors of the crash on either aircraft. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=231.4s)]
*  And in the aftermath of this terrible incident, newly confirmed Trump administration defense [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=238.08s)]
*  secretary Pete Hegseth screwed up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=244.36s)]
*  When a service member, any service member, is killed while in service, there is a strict [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=249.4s)]
*  policy at the Pentagon. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  The Defense Department gives no information about any service member who has been killed [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=255.76s)]
*  until at least 24 hours has elapsed since their death. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=260.36s)]
*  They do not give their rank, their name, they do not give their age, they do not give their [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=264.22s)]
*  rank. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=268.12s)]
*  They give no information about the service member in question. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=269.12s)]
*  And the reason they do that is because the Defense Department, sadly but also obviously, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=272.64s)]
*  has to deal with delivering terrible news like that way more than any other element [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=278.68s)]
*  of our government does. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=283.02s)]
*  And so they very much know how to do it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=284.92s)]
*  And they have very strict rules about it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=287.04s)]
*  They are irreducibly strict, for example, about that 24-hour rule, specifically so they [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=289.96000000000004s)]
*  can be absolutely sure that the next of kin have been notified and have had time to absorb [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  the information before any public announcement is made about the death of a particular service [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=302.16s)]
*  member. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=307.62s)]
*  So, that's the rule. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=309.04s)]
*  Hard and fast. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=311.6s)]
*  No names, no ages, no ranks. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=312.6s)]
*  Nothing for 24 hours. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=313.84s)]
*  And that's not just for service members killed in combat. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=315.35999999999996s)]
*  It's for any service member killed while in service, whether it's a health incident [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  or an accident or a crime or a tragic plane crash. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  That's the rule. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  Nothing for 24 hours. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  And it's a rule for good reason, for reasons of bare human decency but also just competence [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=330.64s)]
*  at dealing with something very difficult. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  Nevertheless, Pete Hegseth today just went to the White House and blurted out that it [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=342.08s)]
*  was a captain and a staff sergeant and a chief warrant officer who all died. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=345.64s)]
*  He just blurted it out. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=350.44s)]
*  This morning. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=352.94s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=353.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=355.64s)]
*  Maybe he is not cut out for this job. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=356.64s)]
*  Maybe he was hired for some reason other than merit, experience, temperament, character. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=360.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=365.32s)]
*  Maybe there was something else about him. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=366.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=367.44s)]
*  But that is how it's going so far. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDay2ZT0cc&t=369.03999999999996s)]
