# Sanctions' Economic Bite Tests Russian Faith In Kremlin War Narrative
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU)
*  This was the Associated Press headline on November 13, 1959. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=0.0s)]
*  Dateline Berlin. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  East Germans jail buyers of blue jeans. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=6.84s)]
*  The East German communists have jailed a teenager for two months because he bought blue jeans [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=10.68s)]
*  in West Berlin. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=15.92s)]
*  The judge told the 18-year-old that the sentence would, quote, serve as a warning to certain [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=17.68s)]
*  young people who ardently want blue jeans or rock and roll, end quote. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=22.96s)]
*  Throughout the Cold War, blue jeans, and in particular Levi's blue jeans, were a coveted [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  and at times forbidden item in the Soviet Union. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=34.32s)]
*  But Soviet teens demanded Levi's, so much so that Levi's jeans started getting smuggled [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=37.44s)]
*  into the Soviet Union like narcotics. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=43.88s)]
*  They were sold for outrageous prices. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=46.46s)]
*  Now to stop the smuggling, the East German government first tried to manufacture their [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=49.36s)]
*  own knockoffs. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=53.28s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=54.36s)]
*  Then the government bulk purchased almost 800,000 pairs of Levi's jeans and had them [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=55.72s)]
*  literally airlifted from the United States so that they could start distributing them [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=61.2s)]
*  right away. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=65.12s)]
*  Well, today, once again, in 2022, Levi's jeans have halted their sales in Russia, joining [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=66.12s)]
*  a growing chorus of companies. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=72.7s)]
*  Disney, Warner Brothers, Sony, Universal, Paramount, all stopping film releases in Russia. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=74.4s)]
*  Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, HP, and Intel, all stopping new sales. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  Netflix has pulled out. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  TikTok won't allow new posts by Russian users. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  Flying out of Russia is nearly impossible now, as is buying anything with major credit [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=89.04s)]
*  cards like Visa, MasterCard, or American Express, all of which, in addition to punishing Western [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=93.92s)]
*  sanctions, takes a toll. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  Try taking a Disney movie away from a kid or an iPhone away from a teenager. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=102.92s)]
*  In addition to a massive ground stop on Western goods and services, the Russian economy is [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=107.26s)]
*  showing real strain. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=112.0s)]
*  Russian interest rates are now 20%. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=114.44s)]
*  The ruble, worth less than a penny. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=117.56s)]
*  Massive inflation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=120.0s)]
*  Russian state media is doing its best to put a positive spin on this invasion of Ukraine, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=121.0s)]
*  except you can't call it an invasion in Russia. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=125.08s)]
*  It's called a special military operation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  But even Russian citizens who are fully bought into the state-sponsored narrative are going [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=130.72s)]
*  to have trouble squaring up what that means, and why they can't use their MasterCard anymore, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=134.68s)]
*  and why they're running out of food at shops, and why their money's worth nothing if this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=139.88s)]
*  is just a special military operation in Ukraine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=143.62s)]
*  A large section of the Russian population is also old enough to remember the Cold War [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=147.18s)]
*  and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and what both of those things did to their economy, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=152.0s)]
*  and how it all led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=156.84s)]
*  You've already seen more than 13,000 anti-war protesters arrested across Russia. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=161.6s)]
*  That unrest seems to be building despite the massive increased risk associated with protesting [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=167.68s)]
*  because of a new law that's been put into place. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=173.34s)]
*  Is the broader Russian population, including many that support Putin, are they actually [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=176.44s)]
*  costly war of choice against a neighbor and the resulting economic deprivation? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=182.28s)]
*  Or is it possible that at some point Vladimir Putin and the Russian government could lose [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=187.6s)]
*  control of the Russian people? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=191.84s)]
*  Joining us now, Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a leading global political [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=194.8s)]
*  risk research and consulting firm. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=199.28s)]
*  Ian, thank you for being here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=201.12s)]
*  You have studied this more than most. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=202.24s)]
*  Let's just talk about this. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=204.68s)]
*  Let's say you can't get the real information. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=205.96s)]
*  You're in Russia and for whatever reason, everything you read follows the official line [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=208.6s)]
*  that this is a strategic operation in Ukraine. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  It's not a war. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not an invasion. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  But suddenly your credit cards don't work and you can't buy stuff and you can't use [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  stuff and you can't see stuff and things aren't available on the shelves and your interest [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=225.28s)]
*  rates are 20% and your money's not worth anything. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=229.42s)]
*  At some point, people are going to say, this official storyline doesn't jive with my life. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  Some people are, Ali, but most people are not. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=238.72s)]
*  Some people are going to be primarily young, educated, literate and online, at least previously [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=242.76s)]
*  online, given how much is being shut down right now by Russia in major cities. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=250.28s)]
*  But the majority of the population is overwhelmingly fed information through state media. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=255.14s)]
*  And that's television, it's newspapers, it's not digital. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=262.76s)]
*  And the level of support for Putin has historically been exceptionally strong among this group [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=267.88s)]
*  and is going to continue to be. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=272.68s)]
*  I mean, if you think that the United States is incredibly divided and that people only [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=273.68s)]
*  follow news and cable and social media that they agree with, that is literally exponentially [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  less than what you're experiencing in Russia right now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=283.44s)]
*  And we have to be aware of that, even as the Russian economy starts to crater, which it [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=286.88s)]
*  will do in spectacular fashion in the coming days. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  But the Russian economy cratering, and some of that was in part due to how much money [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=298.48s)]
*  that the USSR was spending in Afghanistan and the body bags and the people coming back [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=304.12s)]
*  dead. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=311.0s)]
*  But a lot of it was the economy. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=312.0s)]
*  It was how bad things were for the Russian people, which prompted them to throw off their [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  systems, their political systems back then. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=320.24s)]
*  Why wouldn't the same thing happen now, when people are frustrated that 30 years of economic [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=322.68s)]
*  and to some degree political gains seem to be evaporating in front of their eyes? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=327.6s)]
*  Because a lot of the reasons that Russians believe, again, Putin supporting Russians, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=332.92s)]
*  which is not the whole population, but a solid 60 to 70 percent, the reason why they believe [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=338.44s)]
*  the country has fallen into disarray, they don't blame Putin. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=343.48s)]
*  They blame things like shock therapy. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  They blame NATO enlargement. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=350.12s)]
*  They blame the West. And so when they hear from the Kremlin that the reason that the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=351.56s)]
*  Russian economy is cratering is because of a war that the Ukrainians have started or [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=356.72s)]
*  special military operations that are happening because the Russians were about to launch [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=362.64000000000004s)]
*  a war or because they were committing genocide against Russians in the occupied territories, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  absolutely verifiably false. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  But completely what the Russian, the Kremlin narrative has been now for months across Russia, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=373.48s)]
*  they're going to buy it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, come on. We've got a still a strong majority in the United States of people that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=381.8s)]
*  voted for Trump that believe that the election was was fake and in fact, a strong minority that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=386.84s)]
*  believe that he should be returned to power immediately through violence if necessary. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=392.36s)]
*  That's the United States. That's a wealthy, comparatively educated country. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=396.84s)]
*  In Russia, Ali, this is vastly more dysfunctional. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=400.36s)]
*  And you just have to appreciate that Putin does have the capacity to drive [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=404.52s)]
*  that narrative, even in the case of what's going to be a much worse economic collapse [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=410.76s)]
*  than what anyone in the United States has been experiencing for really a century. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  What's the blowback on the rest of the world? We've already seen oil prices topping one hundred [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=423.0s)]
*  and twenty five bucks a barrel. There are a whole bunch of people tweeting me today that they have [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=427.32s)]
*  filled up for more than four dollars a gallon. We are seeing we are approaching some of the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=430.36s)]
*  highest prices for oil and gasoline that we've seen in a while. That's going to happen all over [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=435.32s)]
*  the world. What else happens if this continues? It's probably about a one percent contraction in [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=439.88s)]
*  global GDP that we'll experienced in the United States and in Europe. It's a lot more persistent [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=446.68s)]
*  inflation. Its supply chains being more severed and more challenging. So a lot longer time for [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=453.4s)]
*  you to get whatever it is you're trying to order. But but that's really not the suffering. The [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=459.64s)]
*  suffering are the poorest. And it's a combination of I mean, we've seen about 60 million people die [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=464.76s)]
*  of starvation in the last 12 months around the world, which is higher in the pandemic than it [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=471.0s)]
*  was before the pandemic. That's going to get a hell of a lot worse. Ali, you've just had the largest [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  grain producer in the world invade the fifth largest grain producer in the world. And this [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=480.28s)]
*  is going to cause enormous challenges for the poorest people in the world who already don't [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=486.52s)]
*  get enough to eat. It's Sub-Saharan Africa. It's Yemen. It's Afghanistan. Also emerging markets [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=491.16s)]
*  that are seriously indebted and don't have access to credit are going to be in much more trouble [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=498.12s)]
*  here. The potential for a financial crisis in Turkey, for example, a lot of other medium income [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=503.64000000000004s)]
*  emerging markets that have lived through two years of pandemic but have nowhere near the capacity [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=509.72s)]
*  to make their middle classes whole the way the Americans or the Europeans have through the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=514.12s)]
*  pandemic, they're going to get smashed right now. So it's really global inequality. The last 40 [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=518.92s)]
*  years, globalization has driven the emergence of a global middle class. The pandemic and now even [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=523.8s)]
*  worse, this Russia-Ukraine crisis is going to force all of those people around the world to take it on [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=530.12s)]
*  the chin. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMPziUiTptU&t=535.56s)]
