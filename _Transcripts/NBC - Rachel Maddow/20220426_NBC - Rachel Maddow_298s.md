# L.A. County Sheriff Targets Reporter After Cover-Up Exposed
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4)
*  I'm going to show you a video here that is a little bit hard to watch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=0.0s)]
*  So if you are not inclined to see something like that or if you're watching with kids, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=3.96s)]
*  this is your fair warning if you want to just look away for a minute. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=8.86s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=12.6s)]
*  This is a security video from the San Fernando courthouse in Los Angeles County. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=13.6s)]
*  This video was obtained by the LA Times, and it shows a prisoner, a man in handcuffs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=19.18s)]
*  You see in the blue trousers there on the white-colored shirt. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=23.92s)]
*  His name is Enzo Escalante. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=27.22s)]
*  It starts with him punching an LA County sheriff's deputy, and then you see him get wrestled [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=29.44s)]
*  to the ground. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=32.6s)]
*  Then though, one of the deputies that wrestled him to the ground puts his knee on the prisoner's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=34.92s)]
*  head and continues to kneel on his head for three solid minutes, which left that man on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=40.04s)]
*  the ground alive, thankfully, but pretty well beat up. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=48.56s)]
*  And if there's elements of that video that feel familiar to you, it's important to note [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=52.96s)]
*  the timing here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=55.88s)]
*  That incident took place last year on March 10th, March 10th, 2021, which happens to have [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=57.22s)]
*  been two days after a jury selection had started in the very highly publicized trial of Derek [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=63.9s)]
*  Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murdering George Floyd, specifically [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=70.02s)]
*  by kneeling for minutes on end on the neck of George Floyd. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  Well, it was a reporter at the LA Times named Aileen Chakmedian who published this video [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=81.06s)]
*  last month, along with reporting alleging that the LA County Sheriff's Department, up [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=87.26s)]
*  to and including the sheriff himself, had attempted to cover up the incident because [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=91.78s)]
*  they feared the negative light this incident could shed on the department. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=95.86000000000001s)]
*  The sheriff himself has maintained that he didn't know about this until months after [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=100.62s)]
*  it happened. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=104.38000000000001s)]
*  He says he didn't cover anything up. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=105.38000000000001s)]
*  He says he relieved the deputy of duty immediately after he became aware of what had happened. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=106.74000000000001s)]
*  Well, yesterday, that same LA Times reporter, Aileen Chakmedian, added to the story, reporting [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=112.66000000000001s)]
*  that an LA County Sheriff's Department commander had filed a new legal claim, contesting all [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=119.34s)]
*  of those denials from the sheriff, alleging specifically that the sheriff had viewed a [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=125.78s)]
*  video of the incident just five days after it occurred, not eight months later, which [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=129.9s)]
*  is what he claimed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=134.58s)]
*  The commander further alleges that Sheriff Villanueva said to the group he watched the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=136.3s)]
*  video with, quote, We do not need bad media at this time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=140.34s)]
*  So the LA Times publishes the disturbing video. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=145.9s)]
*  The sheriff says, I had no idea. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=149.3s)]
*  We didn't cover that up. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  As soon as I found out about it, I took action. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=152.46s)]
*  A commander on his own force says that is not true. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=154.3s)]
*  You absolutely knew about it and you did cover it up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  That's where the story stood as of yesterday. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=160.58s)]
*  Where it went today is absolutely bananas, because today LA County Sheriff Villanueva [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=162.34s)]
*  convened a press conference to dispute all of this reporting. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=169.14s)]
*  And what he did at this press conference that is now causing a fresh round of headlines [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=173.78s)]
*  is that he got up at this press conference today in person and he put up a big poster [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=177.73999999999998s)]
*  for everyone to see. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=182.6s)]
*  The poster had three large photos on it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=183.94s)]
*  One on the right is the LA Times journalist who did this reporting. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=187.14s)]
*  Also, another photo is one of his political rivals for the elected position of LA County [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=191.5s)]
*  Sheriff and the third photo was the LA Sheriff Department Inspector General who investigates [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=196.62s)]
*  things like this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=202.5s)]
*  The reason he put up the photo of those three is because the sheriff announced today that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=203.94s)]
*  all three of them are now subjects of a criminal investigation. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=208.02s)]
*  And to how the LA Times reporter, Alain Chakmedian, got that security footage. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=213.34s)]
*  They're all the subjects of a criminal investigation now by his office. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=217.9s)]
*  He says they're all being investigated now for possible felonies like conspiracy and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=221.44s)]
*  burglary and unauthorized use of a database. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=226.14s)]
*  He put up all this list of potential crimes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  All while the LA Times reporter, Alain Chakmedian, was in the front row covering the press conference [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=233.7s)]
*  for this paper while the sheriff puts up her picture as a possible perpetrator who his [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=237.89999999999998s)]
*  office is going after. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=243.22s)]
*  This decision by the sheriff today to announce a criminal investigation into this reporter [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=246.67999999999998s)]
*  Certainly looks like retaliation. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=251.78s)]
*  The executive editor of the LA Times put out this statement tonight, citing the sheriff's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=254.02s)]
*  attempt to criminalize news reporting, saying it goes against well-established constitutional [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=258.42s)]
*  law, quote, we will vigorously defend Chakmedian's and the LA Times' rights in any proceeding [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=263.46s)]
*  or investigation brought by authorities. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=269.02s)]
*  This story started off bad in Los Angeles. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=272.42s)]
*  Today it took a very, very dark turn. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=275.42s)]
*  . [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiXNcUjuAn4&t=281.78s)]
