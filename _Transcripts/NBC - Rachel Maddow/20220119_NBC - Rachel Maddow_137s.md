Video Description: Rachel Maddow lists recent examples of the Senate using the "nuclear option" to allow legislation to pass with a simple majority instead of the filibuster's required 60-vote majority, showing that the resistance to a filibuster exception for voting rights legislation is less about procedure than it is about voting rights.

# Senate Uses 'Nuclear Option' All The Time Despite Manchin & Sinema Saying Otherwise
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8)
*  I was just looking back today at when Republicans were in the majority in the Senate and President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump was in office. During that time, right, Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell is [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=6.48s)]
*  running the Senate, Trump is in the White House. During that time, Mitch McConnell and the Senate [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=12.48s)]
*  Republicans went nuclear and decided it would be a majority vote only, it would be 50 votes only, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=17.04s)]
*  to confirm Supreme Court nominees. Then Mitch McConnell went nuclear another time and decided [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=24.0s)]
*  it would be a majority vote only, it would be 50 votes only needed for lower level executive branch [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=30.48s)]
*  nominees. Then he went nuclear a third time and decided he would change the filibuster rule and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=35.92s)]
*  it would only have to be a majority vote, a 50 vote threshold for federal district court judges. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=41.84s)]
*  Even since President Biden has been president, the United States Senate has decided to go nuclear, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=47.68s)]
*  as they say, to require just a majority vote, just 50 votes on a bill to fund the government [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=52.72s)]
*  last year. They also did it, they went nuclear, they decided it would be just a majority vote, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=58.64s)]
*  just 50 votes for a random vote that didn't go anywhere about vaccine requirements. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=63.2s)]
*  We use the phrase go nuclear because it's supposed to be the end of the world, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  right, it's supposed to be mutually assured destruction. Turns out they go nuclear all the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=72.24s)]
*  time. They go nuclear and decide that a 50 vote majority is enough that we can't have a 60 vote [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=76.56s)]
*  threshold for a particular type of action in the Senate or a particular type of legislation or [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=84.56s)]
*  particular amendment, a particular vote. They do that all the time. Now, even in this Senate, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=88.56s)]
*  even when the Republicans were in control with Trump in the White House, it happens all the time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=94.08s)]
*  But Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema keep saying that this would be an [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=99.84s)]
*  unprecedented thing to do, even though that's absolutely not true. They just keep saying they [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=108.56s)]
*  won't do it for voting rights. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3B863tdDf8&t=129.84s)]
