Video Description: Ukraine's surprise drone attack was bold and creative and a disaster for Russia, but the strategic implications extend beyond the conflict between those two countries. Rachel Maddow explains why the attack puts nuclear strategy in a new light and makes the lack of competent leadership in the United States particularly painful.

# How Ukraine's devastating surprise attack on Russia is a game changer for global military strategy
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA)
*  So they nicknamed this thing the bear. It's a kind of plane, military aircraft, first designed in Russia in the 50s. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=0.0s)]
*  It was built to compete with the American B-52 bomber. This Russian aircraft has a super long range. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=8.0s)]
*  It can fly transcontinental flights. Before it has to stop and refuel, it can carry eight long range missiles. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=14.0s)]
*  Russia has more than a hundred of these big planes and other planes like it, at least they used to. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=21.0s)]
*  Because this was part of Russia's fleet of these planes as of yesterday. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=28.0s)]
*  On fire, destroyed in drone attacks that were launched by Ukraine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=34.0s)]
*  Now, in the Russia-Ukraine war, Russia has been hammering Ukraine with these bombers. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=41.0s)]
*  And this weekend, surprise, Ukraine decided that rather than continuing just to try to intercept as many missiles [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=48.0s)]
*  that these planes have fired from the sky, as many missiles as they could, rather than just trying to defend itself that way, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=55.0s)]
*  Ukraine decided instead that they would take out the planes themselves on the ground inside Russia. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=62.0s)]
*  According to NBC News, Ukraine's security services smuggled more than a hundred drones into Russia, in some cases well into Russia. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=69.0s)]
*  Then they hid them under the roofs of mobile wooden cabins. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=79.0s)]
*  It took months for them to do this to get them all in place. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=84.0s)]
*  But then all at once, simultaneously with no warning, the cabin roofs were opened via remote control. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=87.0s)]
*  And then the drones rose up out of the roofs of these cabins and flew off to Russian military airfields to do their thing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=94.0s)]
*  Packed with explosives. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=102.0s)]
*  Ukraine says they destroyed planes across four different military sites in Russia, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=104.0s)]
*  including in Siberia, at a site which is almost 3,000 miles away from Ukraine. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=109.0s)]
*  Of Russia's entire fleet of these large military bombers, Ukraine says they were able to destroy or severely damage about a third of them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=115.0s)]
*  Now, was Russia aware an attack like this was going to happen or that it could happen? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=125.0s)]
*  Clearly not. They were unaware. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=131.0s)]
*  Did they have defenses in place to protect these planes at their air bases? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=133.0s)]
*  That turns out to be a funny story. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=137.0s)]
*  See anything that strikes you as odd in this screenshot? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=139.0s)]
*  This is a screenshot from one of the videos of the drone attacks that was put out by Ukraine's security services. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=143.0s)]
*  You see those round circles, little black fruit loops right there on the wings of those bomber planes? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=148.0s)]
*  Those are tires. Like tires you put on your car. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=155.0s)]
*  Apparently this is a thing Russia has been doing for a while now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=160.0s)]
*  This photo is from 2023. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=163.0s)]
*  But you see they've got all the little tires stacked up on top of the plane? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=165.0s)]
*  This was apparently Russia's idea of defense for their strategic aircraft on the ground at their own military bases. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=169.0s)]
*  One NATO official telling CNN, quote, We believe it's meant to protect against drones. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=180.0s)]
*  We don't know if this will have any effect. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=186.0s)]
*  Well, now we know. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=189.0s)]
*  Turns out stacking tires on your plane doesn't prevent drones from destroying those planes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=190.0s)]
*  The whole thing is just astonishing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=200.0s)]
*  And not just in a foreign policy way, but also in kind of an action movie sort of way. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=202.0s)]
*  It also has really serious implications for Russia and beyond Russia and the Ukraine War. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=207.0s)]
*  Because those big bombers that Ukraine just torched, those are the kinds of planes that are not only equipped to carry large scale missiles. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=215.0s)]
*  Those are the kinds of planes that are also outfitted to carry nuclear warheads. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=225.0s)]
*  So if you're Russia or if you're the United States or if you're any country with nuclear weapons, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=231.0s)]
*  your national security policies are based in part around the fact that you have this sort of impenetrable nuclear deterrent, right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=237.0s)]
*  Why would anyone attack you if you could then retaliate by flying some long range bomber anywhere on earth and blowing your opponent off the map using your nuclear stockpile? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=244.0s)]
*  Right. That's a sort of linchpin idea of being a nuclear deterrent country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=255.0s)]
*  Well, does Russia still have that same deterrent capability? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=262.0s)]
*  Ukraine just disabled a primary piece of Russia's nuclear arsenal with, you know, handheld sized devices that look like they came from Radio Shack. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=266.0s)]
*  I mean, Russia now has to contend with the fact that their impenetrable nuclear deterrence may be not so impenetrable after all, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=275.0s)]
*  even against a much smaller neighbor that they have been hammering militarily for years now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=284.0s)]
*  That said, it's not only Russia that has to contend with what this means. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=293.0s)]
*  This has really important strategic consequences for every country that thinks of itself as having a nuclear deterrent along the same lines as Russia's. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=297.0s)]
*  For our country, this might be a really good time to have a robust, competent national security apparatus, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=305.0s)]
*  thinking about those kinds of implications and making smart, well informed strategic decisions about how to react to them. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=313.0s)]
*  Wouldn't it be awesome if that's what we had here in our own country? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMa71RVpJcA&t=321.0s)]
