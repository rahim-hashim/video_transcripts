Video Description: Richard Engel, NBC News chief foreign correspondent, talks with Rachel Maddow about how pro-Russian Ukrainians have soured on Vladimir Putin for using them as an excuse for his war, and the likely pattern Putin will pursue to try to put a strongman puppet in charge of Ukraine so he can rule by proxy.

# Pro-Russia Ukrainians Resent Being Used By Putin To Justify War: Engel
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84)
*  Eastern Ukraine is where tonight we find our friend Richard Engel, NBC News chief foreign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=0.0s)]
*  correspondent. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=4.36s)]
*  He's in the port city of Mariupol near the Russian border and nearby to areas that are [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=5.36s)]
*  controlled by Russian-backed separatist forces. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=10.36s)]
*  Richard, I know it's dark 30 there. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=13.32s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=16.04s)]
*  I know it's been a long day. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=17.04s)]
*  Well, I've gotten used to this with you, Rachel, over the years, the middle of the night in [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=18.04s)]
*  trying times. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=25.2s)]
*  So we have to stop meeting like this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=26.56s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=29.84s)]
*  It's almost always terrible news when I see you anywhere other than a bar. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=31.52s)]
*  Richard, let me just ask you, tell us about Mariupol. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=35.44s)]
*  Tell us about the region of Ukraine that you're in and the overall scale of the invasion. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=39.08s)]
*  A lot of the U.S. intelligence about this had been that this was going to be a full-scale [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  invasion, that this was going to involve the whole of Ukraine and not just previously [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=50.16s)]
*  contested areas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  What's it like in the region that you're in and what do you make of the scale of what [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=55.48s)]
*  Russia's done thus far? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=58.36s)]
*  So this area is quite unique. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  And this is sort of the area that Vladimir Putin has been playing to because we're quite [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=67.2s)]
*  close to the Russian border. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=72.72s)]
*  The population here is mixed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=75.3s)]
*  Not everyone here supports Zelensky. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=78.22s)]
*  Not everyone here supports the government. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=79.96s)]
*  Probably, according to just people I've been speaking to, 20, 25 percent of the population [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  who, well, I would say 24 hours ago, liked Russia, who thought that the idea of joining [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  up with Russia was a positive. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=97.16s)]
*  And some of it's because of nostalgia of their memories of the Soviet Union. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=100.8s)]
*  Some of it's because they watch Russian television. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=105.94s)]
*  Some of them are just very poor and any alternative seems better than the lives they have now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=108.46s)]
*  Probably about 20 percent, 25 percent on the other side who do support the government, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=113.5s)]
*  are absolutely ready to fight, to be committed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=119.41999999999999s)]
*  And then maybe that middle ground of about 50 percent left who will take things as it [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=123.17999999999999s)]
*  comes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=130.22s)]
*  That was before this morning. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=131.22s)]
*  Now you have a city here that is afraid. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=133.26s)]
*  People here are down in shelters. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=136.74s)]
*  People here are staying in their homes. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  They were going to buy gas, if they could find it, stockpiling food. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=142.36s)]
*  All the shops and restaurants and any kind of commercial life in this town, except for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=147.10000000000002s)]
*  the supermarkets, are closed right now. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=151.94s)]
*  And there's real fear. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  And there's anger because they believe this is directly organized by Putin. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  They don't blame the Russian people. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=162.62s)]
*  Many here are connected to Russia. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=165.54s)]
*  This is a Russian speaking part of the country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=167.22s)]
*  They blame this on Putin. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=169.6s)]
*  They think this is Putin's personal mission, that he's doing this in their name, and they [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=171.5s)]
*  denounce that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=177.78s)]
*  They say, don't do this in our name. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=178.78s)]
*  That's the situation here in Mariupol. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=182.06s)]
*  And I think it's pretty similar in Kharkiv and other eastern parts. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  In the West, they're angry. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=189.26s)]
*  They're ready to fight. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=191.6s)]
*  They're rallying behind their government. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=193.42s)]
*  They're getting guns that are handed out to them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=195.98s)]
*  Here it's more, why are you doing this in our name? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  We are Russian speakers. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=202.06s)]
*  We're proud Russian speakers. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=203.73999999999998s)]
*  But don't claim that there's some genocide against us and that you're coming in to destroy [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=205.44s)]
*  this country in order to save us. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=209.26s)]
*  Richard, the portrait that you are painting here, though, makes it very hard to project [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=211.57999999999998s)]
*  into the future what Russia's planning on doing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=217.64s)]
*  I mean, it's one thing to have a large, very modern army that can overwhelm the comparatively [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=220.62s)]
*  much smaller and poorly equipped Ukrainian army. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=227.54s)]
*  It's one thing to take land, to take cities even. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=231.12s)]
*  It's another thing to hold them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=235.54s)]
*  Even if you do install some sort of pro-Russian puppet government in Kiev, let's say they're [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=237.02s)]
*  able to go as far as doing that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=240.74s)]
*  The idea that Ukraine is now going to be part of Russia, that Russia is going to govern [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  that is going to lose its status as an independent country and essentially be under Putin's control [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=248.1s)]
*  just seems like a fantasy, at least for anything beyond the short to medium term. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think what he wants to do is what he's done in other places. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=262.14s)]
*  He wants to find someone to subcontract the repression out to. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=267.26s)]
*  And that has been Putin's policy in Chechnya. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=273.4s)]
*  He found a local warlord and said, OK, you are in charge. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=277.1s)]
*  You work for me, but you do your best to repress the people. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=280.70000000000005s)]
*  And as a result, you get a share of the pie. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=284.42s)]
*  He did that in Belarus. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=287.70000000000005s)]
*  Belarus was facing a popular uprising, a democratic uprising, and the leader was on [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=289.14000000000004s)]
*  the ropes and Putin moved in to save him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=297.22s)]
*  And the dictator released a massive crackdown on the human rights abuses. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=301.18s)]
*  He just did the same thing in Kazakhstan. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=306.94s)]
*  Kazakhstan's government was facing an uprising that was lasting a few days. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=308.98s)]
*  Russia Putin sent in forces to back up the dictator and crush the rebellion. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=315.38s)]
*  It was the same thing that he used to do in Ukraine when he had Viktor Yanukovych here. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=322.38s)]
*  He was a pro-Russian puppet, except Viktor Yanukovych made a cardinal mistake in 2014 [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=326.22s)]
*  when there was the democratic uprising. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=332.8s)]
*  Viktor Yanukovych didn't crush it with enough force. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=335.02s)]
*  Instead, he ran and took refuge in Russia. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=338.5s)]
*  So I think probably the only person that Putin hates more than Zelensky is Viktor Yanukovych [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=342.7s)]
*  because he blames him for being the gutless coward who had one responsibility, which was [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=348.94s)]
*  to repress his people for Putin, and he didn't do it. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=354.26s)]
*  Instead, he cut and ran. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=358.21999999999997s)]
*  So I think he's looking for a new strongman who he can install and then allow that strongman [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=361.08s)]
*  to enact terrible repressive policies. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  The Ukrainian people see it coming. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=373.0s)]
*  They've lived this before. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  This will not be something that can be done in a way that will surprise them and that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=376.2s)]
*  in a way that they're likely to accede to. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  Richard Engel, NBC's chief correspondent. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=387.28s)]
*  They know this game. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=388.64s)]
*  And just like with the U.S. releasing all the intelligence about what Russia was going [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=390.96s)]
*  to do in advance, that doesn't avert it from happening, but it does mean that forewarned [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=394.29999999999995s)]
*  is forearmed in terms of preparing for it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=399.12s)]
*  And for eight years, they've tasted democracy and know it's better. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=402.68s)]
*  I'll let you go. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  Till next time. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  Richard Engel, NBC's chief foreign correspondent. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, Richard. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  Much appreciated, my friend. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8tZIl4G84&t=411.03999999999996s)]
