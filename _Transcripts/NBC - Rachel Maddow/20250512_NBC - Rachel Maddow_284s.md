# Free plane highlights Trump's brazen corruption and becomes a political liability for Republicans
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU)
*  So, NBC News has now confirmed that the big jet parked here on the tarmac, and this footage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=0.0s)]
*  from February, is the exact same plane that President Donald Trump plans to accept as [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=7.28s)]
*  a gift from the nation of Qatar. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=13.24s)]
*  This is that plane at Palm Beach International Airport in Florida. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=17.04s)]
*  According to NBC News, this same plane—it's a Boeing 747—it's now parked at a different [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  U.S. airport. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=27.64s)]
*  This was it in Florida in February. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=29.1s)]
*  Apparently, it's now been in San Antonio since April, for some reason. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=31.26s)]
*  If Democrats in Congress don't shame him out of accepting it, that jet from Qatar will [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=36.86s)]
*  become the latest and most flightworthy in a series of very, very, very, very, very, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=41.7s)]
*  very valuable presents that President Trump and his family and his businesses have received [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  from Qatar since he first became president. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=54.82s)]
*  For example, in Qatar, there's the new plan for a Trump International Golf Club and Trump [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  Villas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=65.38s)]
*  The plan for that was just signed last month, thanks to the understanding and generosity [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=66.97999999999999s)]
*  of the Qatari government. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=72.32s)]
*  You may also remember the bailout that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner's company got in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=74.02s)]
*  the first Trump term for their boondoggle office tower in Manhattan. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=79.38s)]
*  That was from a company tied to Qatar. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=84.42s)]
*  Qatari officials denied any involvement in the deal at the time, but there was no denying [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=87.46s)]
*  the capital B billions poured into Jared Kushner's brand-new investment firm that he set up just [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  after he left the White House after Trump's first term—billions of dollars to Jared [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=101.1s)]
*  from not only the government of Qatar, but also the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=106.94s)]
*  Speaking of Saudi Arabia, Trump's company is also developing a new half-billion-dollar [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=112.14s)]
*  Saudi Trump Tower in the city of Jeddah, thanks to the kindness and generosity of the Saudi [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=118.18s)]
*  government. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=125.1s)]
*  In United Arab Emirates, the Trump Organization is now planning another billion-dollar tower, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=126.28s)]
*  thanks again to the kindness and generosity of the Emirati government. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=132.9s)]
*  That new Emirati Trump Tower project was announced last month at a crypto conference [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=137.58s)]
*  in Dubai, where it was also announced that a fund backed by the United Arab Emirates [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=142.3s)]
*  would use Trump's new cryptocurrency to finance a major crypto deal, which would mean they [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=147.78s)]
*  will be putting directly into the Trump family's pockets many, many, many millions of dollars. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=154.22000000000003s)]
*  These are just the presents for Trump that we know about. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=164.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's worth remembering from the end of his first term that Trump left office [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=166.86s)]
*  without ever providing the legally required list of gifts that he and other White House [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=170.74s)]
*  officials received from foreign governments while he was president. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=176.34s)]
*  When Trump got back into the White House to start his second term, he started, day one, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=180.46s)]
*  with eliminating the federal ban on receiving gifts from lobbyists. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=185.58s)]
*  Literally on his first day back in office, he made time to end the ban on federal officials [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=190.86s)]
*  receiving gifts from lobbyists. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=196.22s)]
*  Day one. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=198.78s)]
*  Because everybody knows it's gifts for public officials from lobbyists that will make America [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=200.54s)]
*  great again. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=206.68s)]
*  So yes, Donald Trump or his library will be getting a luxury plane from a foreign country, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=209.68s)]
*  and that is a big deal. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=216.94s)]
*  But it is also like item number Z on a long list of gold-plated gifts Trump and his family [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=219.42s)]
*  have accepted from this country already and from other countries in the region. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=227.06s)]
*  In Washington, a handful of Democrats in the Senate are now asking their colleagues to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  go on record in support of the idea that, quote, no one should use public service for [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=235.54s)]
*  personal gain through foreign gifts. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  You would think that that would not be a hard thing to get people to agree on. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=245.82s)]
*  They're trying to force a vote on it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=250.66s)]
*  Any chance? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=251.66s)]
*  You want to bet a billion dollar golden tower on it or something? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=252.66s)]
*  Maybe a billion dollars? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=256.98s)]
*  Watch this space. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47QrVX4lVOU&t=259.58s)]
