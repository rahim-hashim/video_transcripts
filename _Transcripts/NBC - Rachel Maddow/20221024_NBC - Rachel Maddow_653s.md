# Law Catches Up To 2020 Right-Wing Election Scammers As 2022 Sees New Intimidation Tactics
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE)
*  Just about exactly two years ago, in October 2020, we learned about a story that was broken [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=0.0s)]
*  by a reporter at WWJ named Sandra McNeil. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Sandra McNeil had gotten a tip from a listener to WWJ in Detroit. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=9.96s)]
*  The listener told her that they'd received a really, really sketchy robocall about the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  November 2020 presidential election. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Now, as we all know, basically every robocall is sketchy, right? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=25.48s)]
*  Robocalls, by definition, are shady and annoying and almost always scammy, right? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=29.36s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=35.6s)]
*  But this one that this Detroit resident got right before the 2020 election, this one was so bad. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=37.36s)]
*  It not only seemed worse than your typical robocall, it seemed so bad, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=44.32s)]
*  it kind of seemed like it might be a crime. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=48.88s)]
*  And spoiler alert for the end of the story, it turns out it was a crime. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=52.08s)]
*  Turns out the listener to WWJ was right to sound the alarm about it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=57.28s)]
*  And reporter Sandra McNeil and WWJ were right to go big with the story. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=61.92s)]
*  So I'm going to play you the sound of the robocall now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=67.6s)]
*  I'm going to tell you in advance that everything in this robocall is wrong. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=70.88s)]
*  None of this is true. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=74.64s)]
*  Do not believe a second of it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=75.76s)]
*  But you should hear what it was because this literally was a crime committed against the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  American people, specifically against black registered voters in the lead up to the 2020 election. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=83.2s)]
*  Now, again, everything in that is wrong. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=113.36s)]
*  None of that is true. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=132.88s)]
*  Voting by mail is fine. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=134.88s)]
*  It does not expose you to the police tracking you down. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=137.04s)]
*  It does not expose you to credit card companies getting to you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't expose you to somebody giving you a vaccine you don't want, let alone the CDC doing that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  Voting by mail does none of those things. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=148.16s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=150.48s)]
*  Everything in that robocall was a lie. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=151.2s)]
*  But in 2020, in the lead up to the 2020 election, radio station WWJ in Detroit reported that Detroit residents were receiving that call. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=155.36s)]
*  A lot of Detroit residents were receiving that call. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=162.8s)]
*  Thousands of them were getting that call. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=165.76s)]
*  Now, Detroit, of course, is a Democratic stronghold in the swing state of Michigan. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=168.72s)]
*  It's a city that is roughly 80% African American. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=174.24s)]
*  And here's this call going out to thousands of registered voters saying it's from a civil rights organization, which it was not, and telling people they need to be terrified to vote. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=179.04s)]
*  It's just it's disgusting. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=188.56s)]
*  And it was more than just shady. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=191.04s)]
*  Voter intimidation is a crime. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=192.96s)]
*  That robocall was a crime. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=195.52s)]
*  And here on this show, almost exactly two years ago, after this was first exposed by the local press in Detroit, we had here on the show, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, when she announced that state felony charges were being filed against the two men who initially denied that they put out that call, but then finally admitted that they had done it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=198.16s)]
*  The investigation into that robocall in 2020 ultimately turned up the fact that this trash wasn't just targeted against black voters in Detroit, in Michigan. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=218.24s)]
*  It was also used against thousands of black registered voters in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia and in Pittsburgh, in Illinois, in Chicago, also in New York, also in Ohio. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=228.0s)]
*  Tens of thousands of these calls were placed all to majority black majority democratic voting areas. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=239.84s)]
*  Now, there were those felony case felony charges brought against the guys who brought that call in in Michigan. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=249.04s)]
*  First announced here on this show. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=257.36s)]
*  Also, a federal civil rights lawsuit, excuse me, a federal civil lawsuit was brought against those guys who placed those calls. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=259.36s)]
*  That federal civil lawsuit is still not resolved, but the federal judge hearing that civil case actually ordered the guys who sent out that call that they needed to pay for a follow up corrective call to all the people who got the initial call. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=265.44s)]
*  The follow up explaining that their previous call had contained false information and in fact had been had been determined by in federal court to be an intimidation effort designed to interfere with the election. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=279.52s)]
*  So the federal judge in that case ordered those guys to place follow up calls disavowing everything that had happened in the first call. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  That federal civil case is still pending. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=298.56s)]
*  In addition to the criminal charges in Michigan and that federal civil case and being ordered to send the follow up corrective call, the FCC took a look at this as well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=300.56s)]
*  FCC regulates things like robocalls. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=310.08s)]
*  The FCC made actually a very rare unanimous recommendation that the guys who sent that call should pay the largest fine ever levied against anyone for any robocall of any kind. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=312.08s)]
*  The FCC unanimously recommended they should pay more than five million dollars as a fine for having sent those calls to black voters in advance of the 2020 election. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=325.76s)]
*  In terms of where this stands now, the felony charges brought against those two guys in the state of Michigan, those felony charges are still pending. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=336.0s)]
*  But state prosecutors also brought charges against these guys, felony charges against them in the great state of Ohio. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  And today, almost two years to the day since we first reported on that fantastically racist voter intimidation campaign, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  today, those two conservative activists who sent out those calls to tens of thousands of voters in Ohio and Michigan and New York and Illinois and all these other places, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=363.12s)]
*  those two conservative activists today in court in Ohio pled guilty to felony telecommunications fraud. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  They had been facing 15 felony counts each in Ohio. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=383.12s)]
*  The court allowed them to each plead guilty to one felony in exchange for having the other charges dropped. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=387.52s)]
*  They're going to be sentenced next month. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=393.52s)]
*  They're each looking at up to a year in prison plus whatever they get if they're convicted of the felonies they're facing in Michigan, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=395.52s)]
*  plus the five million dollar plus fine they're facing from the FCC, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=404.56s)]
*  plus whatever may get decided against them in that federal civil case, which is at SDNY. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=408.56s)]
*  That's being handled by the New York Attorney General Tish James. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=413.52s)]
*  So that was two years ago. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=418.4s)]
*  That was how conservative activists were handling the run up to the vote in 2020. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=419.52s)]
*  And these are the consequences they, as of today, are just now starting to face for the fact that what they decided would be their game plan back in 2020 happened to be as fantastically illegal as it was disgusting. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=424.0s)]
*  The folks who are trying to contest the election this year by doing things that are illegal, like we saw in 2020 from the conservative side, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=436.0s)]
*  the people who are doing that version of those tactics again this year, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  Intimidating people out of voting, threatening people for voting. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  It may have taken two years before we got some accountability for one of the worst instances of that in the last election. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=453.6s)]
*  It may have taken till today before we saw the first felony guilty plea pursuant to those tactics used on the conservative side in the 2020 election. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=458.48s)]
*  But it may not have to take another two years this time. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=468.88s)]
*  In Arizona, where we are seeing Republican candidates and Republican elected officials tell their supporters to go out and intimidate people at voting sites, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=472.56s)]
*  where we are seeing people respond to those calls by showing up with guns at voting sites. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=482.0s)]
*  Tonight in Arizona, we just got the first legal challenge to what these vigilantes are doing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=488.56s)]
*  Here it is. The complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief just filed tonight in federal court in Arizona. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=495.12s)]
*  At least five times last week, supporters of defendant Clean Elections USA gathered at ballot drop boxes in Maricopa County, Arizona, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=501.76s)]
*  with the express purpose of deterring voters from depositing their ballots. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=509.52s)]
*  And things are getting worse. On Friday, two of the drop box watchers were armed and wearing tactical gear. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=513.4399999999999s)]
*  And again on Saturday, armed and masked individuals were gathered near drop boxes. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=518.88s)]
*  Defendants' activities have already prompted three voter intimidation complaints that have been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  as well as responses and investigations by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=529.52s)]
*  Defendants boast that they are just getting started. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  Defendants' coordinated campaign of vigilante voter intimidation violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=537.4399999999999s)]
*  In the aftermath of previous voter suppression efforts and the reconstruction in civil rights eras, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=546.24s)]
*  Congress responded forcefully by enacting laws that unequivocally prohibit voter intimidation. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=550.64s)]
*  Immediate relief is necessary. Voting is already underway. There are only 15 days left until election day. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  Again, this was filed in federal court tonight. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  Defendants' organized vigilante groups have already turned away voters. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=565.52s)]
*  Under any circumstance, defendants' conduct would be objectively intimidating. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=570.08s)]
*  But in the current charged political climate, defendants' actions carry with them exacerbated threats. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=574.1600000000001s)]
*  There is no guarantee that the crowds that defendants have mobilized and are continuing to stoke will remain peaceful. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=579.28s)]
*  Unless enjoined, defendants will continue to bully and intimidate lawful Arizona voters, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=586.4s)]
*  including through using armed presences, voters who are attempting to do nothing more than vote in accordance with Arizona law. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=592.24s)]
*  And then here's the plea for relief. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=600.0s)]
*  Wherefore, plaintiffs respectively request that this court enter judgment in their favor and against defendants, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=602.8000000000001s)]
*  and declare that defendants have violated the Voting Rights Act, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=608.0s)]
*  and declare that defendants have violated the Ku Klux Klan Act, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=610.72s)]
*  and temporarily and permanently enjoin the defendants and their respective agents, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=613.52s)]
*  officers, employees, and successors, and all persons acting in concert with each or any of them, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=617.36s)]
*  from gathering with inside of drop boxes, from following, taking photos of, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=621.92s)]
*  or otherwise recording voters or prospective voters, for training, organizing, or directing others to do the same. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=625.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_Vo-U9rIE&t=643.52s)]
