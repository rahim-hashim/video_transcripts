# An American Finds A Role To Play In Supplying Ukrainian Fighters
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 24, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI)
*  You ran into some folks today in Lviv, who you and I talked about on this show, a group [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=0.0s)]
*  of volunteers called the Blue and Yellow. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=4.96s)]
*  They transfer critical supplies from supportive neighboring countries to Ukraine. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=7.72s)]
*  They've been doing what they've been doing since 2014, since the Syrian refugee crisis. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=13.84s)]
*  What did you hear? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=18.36s)]
*  Yeah, and this is a group that was put together by a man named Jonas and his friends. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=20.16s)]
*  They're sort of a ragtag group of friends that have been doing this, as you said, since [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  the invasion of Crimea in 2014. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=29.92s)]
*  It is only since this recent invasion a month ago where they've seen an influx of money, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=32.24s)]
*  16 million euros they've gotten in just a month. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=37.2s)]
*  And there you see it on the left side of your screen. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  This was this morning in Lviv in a parking lot just right behind me outside of a church [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=41.72s)]
*  in broad daylight, hundreds of flak jackets, scopes for sniper rifles, drones that they [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  say they're going to quote, use to drop presence on the Russians. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  That is code for explosives. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=54.92s)]
*  They're using these drones to run them into these armored columns as well as anti drone [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=56.28s)]
*  jamming equipment, especially here in the western part of the country. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=60.56s)]
*  I was unaware that the Russians are apparently using drones in the western part of the country [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=63.56s)]
*  and some of this anti jamming equipment is what is needed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=67.52s)]
*  There's also an American, there he is, an American amongst the group who said he came [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=70.76s)]
*  over actually because he saw some news reporting on NBC and he wanted to be a part of it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=74.32s)]
*  I asked him what I ask every American that I see here, how did he get here? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=78.68s)]
*  How did that process work? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=81.6s)]
*  Here's a little bit of that exchange. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=82.72s)]
*  How did you get linked up with this group? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=85.72s)]
*  I just moved to Lithuania and first thing I just went to Ukrainian embassy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=87.64s)]
*  Andre, military attache came out. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=95.44s)]
*  Where at the embassy, where? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=99.0s)]
*  The building is Lithuania. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=100.0s)]
*  My parents lived there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  I just asked which organization they trust most because I brought some gear myself, bought [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=104.68s)]
*  them my own money and I still go blue and yellow. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  First day I was working in a warehouse. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  Next day Yonis asked who's free to go. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=115.68s)]
*  Here you are. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, three days later I'm in Lviv. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  That's my second trip here right now. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=123.12s)]
*  And so for countries like Lithuania who very much live in fear of some kind of Russian [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=129.6s)]
*  response to their support, they're using these middlemen, these middle groups, these NGOs [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  to get this here to the country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=138.8s)]
*  They took this stuff right out of Lithuania, Ali. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=140.76s)]
*  They put it in vans. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  They drove it right across Poland and they got here this morning. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  That stuff is all headed to the east where we see these horrendous, horrendous videos, Ali. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llfCQvOsuJI&t=146.56s)]
