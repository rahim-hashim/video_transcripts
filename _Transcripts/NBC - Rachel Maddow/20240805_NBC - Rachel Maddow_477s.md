# Maddow: Pro-Trump administrators are already in place to subvert the 2024 election
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo)
*  2020, just as officials in Wayne County, Michigan, were about to certify the vote in that year's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=0.0s)]
*  presidential election, two of that county's election officials, both of them Republicans, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=6.4s)]
*  got a surprise call from the president of the United States. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=12.0s)]
*  Donald Trump himself and the then chair of the Republican Party, Ronald McDaniel, called [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=15.6s)]
*  them personally. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=20.88s)]
*  According to the Detroit News, Trump and Ms. McDaniel then told those two county election [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=22.28s)]
*  officials they needed essentially to take back their vote to certify the election results. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=27.64s)]
*  And those two county officials did actually try to take back their vote to certify. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Then when it was time to certify the elections at the state level, Republicans in Michigan [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=38.24s)]
*  again tried to block the vote total from being certified. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=42.72s)]
*  It was only after one very brave Republican election official broke with his fellow Republicans [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=46.64s)]
*  that Michigan's state results were finally able to be made official. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=51.72s)]
*  Republicans pioneered this in Michigan in 2020. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=57.24s)]
*  Now Republicans have kept trying this kind of thing in every election since, including [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=60.44s)]
*  in congressional elections. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=65.88s)]
*  In the primaries in the 2022 midterms, Republicans in at least 10 counties refused to certify [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=67.12s)]
*  the vote. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=72.76s)]
*  In the general election in the midterms that year, county-level Republicans in Pennsylvania [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=73.8s)]
*  and in Arizona tried to block the certification of the results. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=79.36s)]
*  This year, Republican elections officials in multiple jurisdictions have refused to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=84.08s)]
*  certify lawful elections repeatedly. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=88.84s)]
*  And now they're laying the foundation to do it again for the next national election. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=93.28s)]
*  Over the weekend, Donald Trump held a rally in Atlanta where he randomly shouted out by [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=101.12s)]
*  name three members of the Georgia State Board of Elections. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=106.4s)]
*  These three officials have all refused to acknowledge that Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=111.4s)]
*  election. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=116.28s)]
*  They are now trying to push through new rules that would make it easier for county-level [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=117.28s)]
*  officials to refuse to certify election results. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=121.56s)]
*  This seems to be part of a unified strategy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  Encourage Republican elections officials at every level to refuse to certify the elections [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=129.12s)]
*  no matter what the results are. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=133.8s)]
*  Doesn't matter where. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=135.24s)]
*  Doesn't matter if it's a county that Democrats won or a county that Republicans won. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=136.24s)]
*  Trying to certify the election at the local level just sticks a wrench in the works. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=141.0s)]
*  It makes it impossible to certify. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=146.12s)]
*  If you make it impossible to certify a county, then you make it effectively impossible to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=149.72s)]
*  certify a state. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=153.72s)]
*  And then ultimately, that puts the whole tallying of the presidential election result into question. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=156.16s)]
*  Veteran Democratic elections lawyer Mark Elias writes, quote, it is worse this election than [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=163.14s)]
*  this year the GOP is far more organized. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=169.0s)]
*  They might have tried to subvert the results in a handful of places in 2020 and 2022, but [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=171.84s)]
*  this year they will try to subvert them all. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=176.88s)]
*  Setting the stage now for what is to come in November. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=180.64s)]
*  Joining us now is Mark Elias who specializes in election litigation. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=184.16s)]
*  He's the founder of Democracy Docket. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Elias, thank you very much for joining us tonight. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=189.84s)]
*  I appreciate you being here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=191.6s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=193.48s)]
*  So we've been talking about this on and off for months. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=194.84s)]
*  We've been talking about it pretty intensively for the last few weeks. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=198.36s)]
*  Let me just ask you as an expert, if not the expert in this field, am I getting any of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=201.6s)]
*  this wrong or seeing any of this the wrong way around or am I presenting this in a way [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=207.44s)]
*  that you think basically captures the facts? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  I think you captured entirely correctly. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=214.08s)]
*  The fact is that when we talk about who won an election, we're really talking about two [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  things. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=221.52s)]
*  We're talking about the unofficial results that people get on election night, which is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=222.52s)]
*  what AP reports, what NBC and MSNBC use to call elections on election night. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=225.84s)]
*  But then we are really talking about the certified results. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=232.6s)]
*  And these are the results that are first approved at the polling place and then at the county [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=235.72s)]
*  and as you point out, then at the state and then ultimately in presidential elections [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=241.12s)]
*  that choose the electors and then those certificates from the governor go to the Congress. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=246.08s)]
*  And Rachel, if you think of it this way, January 6th was the culmination of a certification [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=252.0s)]
*  dispute, which as you point out, began among other places in Michigan at the county level. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=256.91999999999996s)]
*  And when Republicans couldn't achieve what they wanted to at the county level, they went [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=261.88s)]
*  to the state level. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=265.53999999999996s)]
*  When they couldn't achieve that, they launched a fake electors scheme, which was just another [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=266.53999999999996s)]
*  way of undermining accurate certification of elections. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=269.46s)]
*  When they couldn't do that, they launched a series of frivolous lawsuits. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=272.56s)]
*  And finally, they attempted to block what on January 6th? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=276.76s)]
*  The certification of the election. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=280.76s)]
*  So this has been on their radar screen for some time and it would be on their radar screen [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=283.22s)]
*  for short in 2024. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=287.1s)]
*  We have seen them not just planning to do this for the 2024 election, but trying it [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=288.8s)]
*  out in multiple jurisdictions. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  You among others have pointed out that this is a tactic at the county elections board [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=295.54s)]
*  level that was essentially unheard of before 2020. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=300.0s)]
*  But now it has happened literally dozens of times. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=303.76s)]
*  It hasn't very off the radar, like municipal elections, sometimes in primary, sometimes [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=306.6s)]
*  in general elections. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=310.68s)]
*  There hasn't yet been another presidential election during which they've tried it. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=312.02000000000004s)]
*  But what have you learned about how this process works, how these essentially concocted controversies [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=315.42s)]
*  can be resolved when they do this stuff at the county level? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=324.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=328.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, look, I have done more recounts and election, post-election litigation than any [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  person ever. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=335.12s)]
*  And I've never I had never seen it before 2020. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=336.88s)]
*  In 2020, I represented President Biden in the DNC and 60 plus cases. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  We saw it in Michigan. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=343.12s)]
*  But before that, I had done recounts in for Al Franken in Minnesota for for various Senate [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=344.12s)]
*  campaigns, statewide campaigns. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=348.36s)]
*  And the idea of tinkering with the certification at the local level was was just out of bounds. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, that is part of the pageantry of democracy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=357.32s)]
*  It is what makes us great as a country that after a hard fought election, the election [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=359.56s)]
*  officials celebrate the results by by by certifying these election results and whatever [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=364.3s)]
*  takes place in court after that takes place after that in court. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=369.9s)]
*  But, you know, Rachel, we saw in 2022 that they refused to certify the elections in [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=373.18s)]
*  Cochise County, Arizona and in several places in Pennsylvania. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=378.58s)]
*  I sued them. We won the folks in Cochise County subsequently got indicted for it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=382.14s)]
*  And you might think that would serve as a deterrent for 2024. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=386.98s)]
*  But, you know, as Donald Trump proved, the loyalty to his crimes and misdeeds is stronger [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=390.3s)]
*  than people's instinct for self-preservation. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=395.82s)]
*  Briefly, Mark, what can people who are concerned about this do to try to make sure it doesn't [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=398.3s)]
*  happen? Yeah, so we all play a role. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=402.5s)]
*  So, first of all, you know, thank you for calling this out. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=404.86s)]
*  Lawyers, we go to court. But, you know, making this public is the big part of the battle. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=407.14s)]
*  And I'd ask every person listening to this to to speak out on this. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=411.26s)]
*  You know, don't stay silent. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=415.98s)]
*  You know, you all have a town square. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=417.38s)]
*  You don't all have millions of viewers like Rachel Maddow, but each and every one of you [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=419.06s)]
*  can post on social media. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=422.38s)]
*  You can attend these canvas board meetings. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=423.86s)]
*  You can file comments in Georgia before the state election board in your own counties. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=425.94s)]
*  You can know who is on these boards and you can attend their meetings. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=431.5s)]
*  Every citizen has a role to play here. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=434.62s)]
*  And if we all do that, I am confident that we will defeat these efforts and Kamala Harris [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=436.78s)]
*  will be sworn in as the next president of the United States. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=441.86s)]
*  Mark Elias, lawyer specializing in election litigation, the founder of Democracy Ducket. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=445.18s)]
*  Mark, I have a feeling this is the start of several conversations we're going to have on this. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=449.58s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time tonight. Keep us surprised. OK. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQfI3awx-wo&t=453.46s)]
