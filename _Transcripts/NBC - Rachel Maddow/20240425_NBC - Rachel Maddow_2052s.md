# Trump on trial: Supreme Court arguments on immunity Highlights
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38)
*  The appeals court proceedings made headlines across the country after one of the three [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=0.0s)]
*  appellate judges who heard the appeal asked Trump's lawyer in court a shocking hypothetical [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=4.48s)]
*  about whether he could order the assassination of a political rival and really not be charged [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=10.36s)]
*  for it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=16.92s)]
*  Trump's counsel said indeed that was their position. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=18.88s)]
*  So all the federal judges who reviewed Trump's audacious immunity claim, all of them have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=24.52s)]
*  seemed not just disinclined to go along with it, they have seemed shocked by it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=30.16s)]
*  And their clarion decisions again at the trial court level and at the appellate level, their [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=35.44s)]
*  clarion decisions against him on this immunity question really seemed like they would be [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=39.92s)]
*  the last word. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=44.16s)]
*  But with this Supreme Court never say never. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=46.82s)]
*  The United States Supreme Court sat on this issue for weeks and then finally announced [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=50.76s)]
*  that they wanted to take this case themselves. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=56.44s)]
*  They announced they would take it today, what is probably the latest possible day on which [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=59.12s)]
*  they could have scheduled these arguments. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=63.92s)]
*  To the extent that Trump's best defense tactic is delay, the Supreme Court has already been [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=66.4s)]
*  an excellent accomplice in that defense. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=72.48s)]
*  Even with that backdrop, the arguments today were legitimately, I think, stunning. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=78.08s)]
*  Trump's counsel was grilled for about an hour. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  The counsel for prosecutor Jack Smith and the Justice Department was grilled for nearly [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=88.32s)]
*  twice that amount of time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  But almost immediately at the start of proceedings, under questioning from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=95.86s)]
*  we got confirmation that the appeals court hypothetical, that crazy hypothetical about [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=101.7s)]
*  Trump being able to assassinate his political enemies and never be charged for it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=106.88s)]
*  We got confirmation right at the start that that was not a fluke. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=111.6s)]
*  President Trump in fact maintains and his lawyers maintain that he really is immune [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=114.88s)]
*  from prosecution specifically for killing his political rivals. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to give you a chance to say if you stay by it, if the president decides that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  his rival is a corrupt person and he orders the military or orders someone to assassinate [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=133.72s)]
*  him, is that within his official acts for which he can get immunity? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=143.68s)]
*  It would depend on the hypothetical, but we can see that could well be an official act. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=149.92s)]
*  It could and why. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=153.0s)]
*  That could be an official act, really. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=155.56s)]
*  He might officially as part of his presidential duties want to kill his domestic political [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=157.9s)]
*  rival and if it's an official act, Trump's lawyers say, well, he's immune from prosecution [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=163.38s)]
*  for that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=168.5s)]
*  So, in other words, yes, we think he should be able to do that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=169.5s)]
*  Anything else you want to clarify that he should be able to do? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=172.82s)]
*  It turns out quite a bit actually. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  It's not just assassinating his individual domestic political opponents. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=177.3s)]
*  It's worse than that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=181.66s)]
*  Over to you Justice Kagan. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  And here questioning Trump's counsel, John Sauer. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=185.34s)]
*  If a president sells nuclear secrets to a foreign adversary, is that immune? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=189.94s)]
*  That sounds like similar to the bribery example, likely not immune. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=196.02s)]
*  Now, if it's structured as an official act, you would have to be impeached and convicted [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=199.06s)]
*  first before. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=202.1s)]
*  What does that mean, if it's structured as an official act? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=203.46s)]
*  Well, I don't know in the hypothetical whether or not that would be an official act. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=205.58s)]
*  You probably have to have more details to apply the blazing game analysis or even the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=208.86s)]
*  Fitzgerald analysis that we've been talking about. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=214.08s)]
*  How about if a president orders the military to stage a coup? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  I think that, as the Chief Justice pointed out earlier, where there is a whole series [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  of, you know, sort of guidelines against that, so to speak, like the UCMJ prohibits the military [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=228.5s)]
*  from following a plainly unlawful act. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=235.44s)]
*  Now, if one adopts, for example, the Fitzgerald test that we advanced, that might well be [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=237.56s)]
*  an official act, and he would have to be, as I'll say in response to all these kinds of hypotheticals, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=242.28s)]
*  has to be impeached and convicted before he can be criminally prosecuted. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=245.28s)]
*  But I emphasized in the court that— [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=249.28s)]
*  Well, he's gone. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=250.28s)]
*  Let's say this president who ordered the military to stage a coup. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=251.28s)]
*  He's no longer president. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=255.28s)]
*  He wasn't impeached. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=256.96s)]
*  He couldn't be impeached. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=257.96s)]
*  But he ordered the military to stage a coup, and you're saying that's an official act. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=261.24s)]
*  I think it would depend on— [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=265.48s)]
*  That's immune. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=266.48s)]
*  I think it would depend on the circumstances whether it was an official act. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=267.48s)]
*  Again, he would have to be impeached. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=271.84s)]
*  Well, what does that mean, depend on the circumstances? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=272.84s)]
*  He was the president. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=275.32s)]
*  He is the commander-in-chief. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=276.32s)]
*  He talks to his generals all the time, and he told the generals, I don't feel like leaving [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=280.0s)]
*  office. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  I want to stage a coup. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  Is that immune? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  If it's an official act, there needs to be impeachment and conviction beforehand because [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  the framers viewed the risk—that kind of very low risk— [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=292.76s)]
*  If it's an official act, is it an official act? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=295.64s)]
*  If it's an official act, it's impeachment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=298.32s)]
*  Is it an official act? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=299.32s)]
*  On the way you described that hypothetical, it could well be. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  I just don't know. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=304.32s)]
*  You'd have to—again, it's a fact-specific context, a specific determination— [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=305.32s)]
*  That answer sounds to me as though it's like, yeah, under my test, it's an official act. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  But that sure sounds bad, doesn't it? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=312.84s)]
*  Well, it certainly sounds very bad, and that's why the framers have—and that's why the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=314.68s)]
*  framers have a whole series of structural checks that have successfully, for the last [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=318.68s)]
*  234 years, prevented that very kind of extreme hypothetical. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  Has that extreme hypothetical always been prevented? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  But yes, Your Honor, that certainly, quote, sounds very bad. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=333.52s)]
*  You can see where he's going at the end of this, though, right? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=337.0s)]
*  When he calls that an extreme hypothetical, this is an important part, I believe, of how [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=339.12s)]
*  today's proceedings went. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=343.56s)]
*  Trump's lawyer and most of the conservative justice today carried on with these proceedings [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=345.12s)]
*  at the Supreme Court as if it is just a wild hypothetical, just a crazy pipe dream, like [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=350.56s)]
*  a Martian scenario, that a president might try a coup, might try to use force to stay [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=356.72s)]
*  in power after he was voted out. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=362.48s)]
*  Yeah, who could ever imagine something like that? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=364.0s)]
*  Trump's lawyer today called that unlikely. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=367.6s)]
*  He specifically called it, and I quote, very, very unlikely as a scenario today. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=369.92s)]
*  That is the wisdom of the framers. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  What they viewed as the risk that needed to be guarded against was not the notion that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  the president might escape a criminal prosecution for something very, very unlikely in these [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=383.36s)]
*  unlikely scenarios. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  They viewed much more likely and much more destructive to the republic the risk of factional [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  strife discussed by George Washington. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=394.0s)]
*  Framers did not put an immunity clause into the Constitution. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=395.84s)]
*  They knew how to. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=398.92s)]
*  There were immunity clauses in some state constitutions. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=399.92s)]
*  They knew how to give legislative immunity. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=403.24s)]
*  They didn't provide immunity to the president. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=405.44s)]
*  And not so surprising, they were reacting against a monarch who claimed to be above [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=408.28s)]
*  the law. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=413.16s)]
*  Wasn't the whole point that the president was not a monarch? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=414.16s)]
*  The whole point of, you know, America, why we're a country. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=419.72s)]
*  Justice Elena Kagan there with Trump counsel, John Sauer. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=424.6s)]
*  Basically what he's saying there is the idea of anyone actually trying a coup to stay in [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=429.0s)]
*  power, a president trying that, that's crazy. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=434.36s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=437.48s)]
*  That's so extreme. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=438.48s)]
*  We don't have to worry about a hypothetical like that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=439.48s)]
*  It's really partisan strife. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=441.96s)]
*  It's really conflict between political parties. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  That's the biggest risk to the country. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=446.0s)]
*  Not this crazy idea of a potential coup. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=448.0s)]
*  Justice Kagan there responding by basically saying, yeah, okay, also, but maybe tyranny, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=451.44s)]
*  maybe a tyrant, unbound by law, running the country with impunity. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=455.96s)]
*  Maybe that would be bad for us too. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=459.76s)]
*  Maybe that's why we were actually formed as a constitutional republic. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=461.16s)]
*  As a general matter, it is folly to extrapolate from oral arguments and say that, you know, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=468.4s)]
*  how the ruling will come down based on the comments from the justices when the case was [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=473.44s)]
*  heard. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=477.56s)]
*  With that caveat though, it seemed clear today that the most conservative justices were inclined [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  to side with Trump, not just on a technicality, but possibly on the substance. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=487.12s)]
*  Justice Clarence Thomas suggesting today that presidents are always committing crimes. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=494.24s)]
*  Shout out to Operation Mongoose from Justice Clarence Thomas today. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=499.48s)]
*  Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice Samuel Alito today describing prosecutors and judges [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=504.52s)]
*  and even grand juries of citizens in terms that would be right at home in a Trump social [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=508.48s)]
*  media feed about how there isn't really a rule of law in this country and that what [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=513.2s)]
*  looks like our supposed legal system is really just corrupt people who are out to get Donald Trump. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  The conservative justices today were absolutely and consistently unwilling to discuss Trump's [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  alleged crimes as laid out in the indictment that led to this case to the point that it [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  became almost a comedic, gymnastic effort at avoidance between Justice Alito and the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=534.48s)]
*  lawyer for special counsel Jack Smith. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=543.28s)]
*  If the court has concerns about the robustness of it, I would suggest looking at the charges [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=547.08s)]
*  in this case. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=553.04s)]
*  Well, I'm going to talk about this in the abstract. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=554.04s)]
*  Conspiracies to defraud the United States with respect to one of the most important [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=558.0799999999999s)]
*  functions, namely the certification of the next president. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=562.12s)]
*  Well, I don't want to dispute that particular application of that, of 371, conspiracy to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=565.12s)]
*  defraud the United States of the particular facts here. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=572.12s)]
*  It's difficult to think of a more critical function than the certification of who won [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=575.0s)]
*  the election. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=579.7199999999999s)]
*  As I said, I'm not discussing the particular facts of this case. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=581.4s)]
*  Stop, stop with the facts. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=584.64s)]
*  Stop. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=586.84s)]
*  Do not tell me about the things that whoever your client is did or the things in the indictment [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=588.84s)]
*  of whoever your client is that led to this case, whatever it's about. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=596.52s)]
*  I want to speak purely in the abstract as if the particular facts of this case, the [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=600.64s)]
*  particular facts of what Donald Trump did are actually just an unimaginable extreme [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=604.44s)]
*  hypothetical that I don't need to engage with. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=609.24s)]
*  The not consensus, but I think widely held view of today's proceedings at the United [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=614.24s)]
*  States Supreme Court is that the conservatives on the court will likely succeed in using [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=618.36s)]
*  this case to further and fatally delay criminal court proceedings against Donald Trump before [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=623.72s)]
*  the election in November. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=630.36s)]
*  Rather than reject his claims of immunity from prosecution, like all the federal judges [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=632.24s)]
*  who have considered this matter before them have done, they instead will carve out some [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=637.76s)]
*  newly specified class of actions that are immune from prosecution if you're a president. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=642.16s)]
*  And they will invent a test for deciding what counts as that kind of action by a president. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=648.52s)]
*  And then they will send Trump's indictment, Trump's federal January 6th case, back through [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=654.48s)]
*  a whole new cycle in the lower federal courts to run his attempted overthrow of the government [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=659.28s)]
*  through the courts newly invented legal tests that they are going to make for him in this [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=665.12s)]
*  case, which, yes, will take forever because in the meantime, of course, he will get a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=670.16s)]
*  chance to get back into the White House in order to shut the whole thing down. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=676.28s)]
*  And in the meantime, the American people will be asked to go and vote on whether he should [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=680.8s)]
*  take that seat again in the White House without knowing what federal prosecutors have found [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=684.04s)]
*  and believe is criminal about his conduct when he tried to overthrow the government [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=688.72s)]
*  to stay in office the last time. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=693.36s)]
*  Let's talk about this. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=696.72s)]
*  Let's talk about how it went. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=697.72s)]
*  Chris Hays, let me... [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=698.72s)]
*  Rachel, I got a lot. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=699.72s)]
*  I got a lot. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=700.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=701.72s)]
*  We got a long time. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=702.72s)]
*  We got a special. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=703.72s)]
*  Tell us, start at the top. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=704.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, I found it, I guess sort of viscerally, I found it one of those maybe a handful of [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=706.2s)]
*  moments over the last eight years that felt like genuine vertigo, like almost a physical [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=711.44s)]
*  sensation of like, am I losing my mind here? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=714.72s)]
*  Like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=717.8s)]
*  There's something wrong about this. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=720.96s)]
*  Why did this sort of give this sense of distress? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=723.2s)]
*  And I think the reason is this. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=725.4s)]
*  Donald Trump's framing of this prosecution is that what is extraordinary about it is [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=727.2s)]
*  the fact of the prosecution, whereas the lower courts and the rest of us, I believe, that's [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=731.24s)]
*  what's extraordinary are the actions he took to warrant the prosecution. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=735.6800000000001s)]
*  What is unprecedented here are the actions at issue, which is the first attempt to disrupt [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=740.08s)]
*  the peaceful transfer of power since the cannons fired at Fort Sumter, not that an indictment [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=744.08s)]
*  was brought. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=749.5600000000001s)]
*  But from the very first moments, the conservatives and the court and in the framing of the question [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=750.68s)]
*  adopted the notion that what is new here and extraordinary needs to be justification is [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=754.3199999999999s)]
*  the prosecution itself. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=760.3599999999999s)]
*  And in so doing, what they did was, as you said quite well, adopted the most cynical [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=762.4s)]
*  sort of authoritarian and relativistic view of all this that Trump himself adopts, which [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=768.56s)]
*  is, well, any prosecutor can prosecute anyone for anything. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=776.3199999999999s)]
*  And we saw this in the Colorado case as well. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=780.56s)]
*  This assumption that everyone below this court, these austere gentlemen with their impeccable [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=784.16s)]
*  vision, everyone below them are political hacks. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=789.72s)]
*  Well, the Colorado Supreme Court, they just don't want Trump on the ballot. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=792.0799999999999s)]
*  And what if a red state court gets him off the ballot? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=794.84s)]
*  Then any prosecutor could prosecute anyone. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=796.96s)]
*  And what happens next? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=798.64s)]
*  A Democrat gets prosecuted by a Republican. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=799.64s)]
*  And all these political hacks everywhere, we are the only ones who see clearly. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=801.4s)]
*  We don't trust all this other process happening beneath us, the district court and the appellate [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=805.9s)]
*  court and the grand jury and the prosecutor and the Department of Justice and the attorney [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=809.96s)]
*  general and the duly elected president who appointed him and the Colorado Supreme Court. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=813.6s)]
*  No, all of that. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=817.0s)]
*  No, we get to say never considering that they're the political hacks, that the people who are [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=818.0s)]
*  actually engaging in regular order here are all these lower bodies that have produced [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=824.4000000000001s)]
*  this to this situation. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  And in so doing, what it felt like was almost a philosophical endorsement of the worst aspects [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=830.0s)]
*  which is that this is all just power politics by another name. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=837.2s)]
*  That none of this actually adheres to any set of regularity or rules of law. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=840.9200000000001s)]
*  That the reason that this hasn't happened before is because there's never been as partisan [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=845.88s)]
*  a prosecutor as Jack Smith. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=851.2s)]
*  That that's what's unprecedented here. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=853.36s)]
*  That it's not because of what he did. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=855.44s)]
*  And so to walk into the third branch of government and these people with all this power, the [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=857.48s)]
*  creative minds who brought you 12 year old giving birth to a rapist child, that to listen [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=862.4000000000001s)]
*  to these folks and find them in the highest halls of power adopting the most authoritarian [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=867.5600000000001s)]
*  and cynical vision of this was a genuinely shocking experience. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=875.24s)]
*  Lawrence O'Donnell, I want to go to you next and I will foreshadow what's about to happen here. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=879.2800000000001s)]
*  Katie was in the courtroom and heard the arguments. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=884.2s)]
*  Ari is a lawyer, just like Katie. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=887.2800000000001s)]
*  We're going to make you guys go last and bat clean up. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=889.08s)]
*  I'm feeling like I have as much anxiety about this as you do, Chris. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=891.56s)]
*  I want to go to you, Lawrence, because you are the man who usually tells us that we are [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=895.76s)]
*  overreacting. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  I would like you to throw cold water on my feelings and Chris's. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=900.4399999999999s)]
*  So there's no cause for alarm in any of this. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=904.64s)]
*  God bless you, my child. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=908.72s)]
*  As long as Joe Biden is reelected. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=910.12s)]
*  If that was a given fact, if he was running with, say, the 18 point lead in the polls [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=915.76s)]
*  that Bill Clinton had at a certain point in his reelection campaign, there would be a [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=921.6400000000001s)]
*  lot less nervousness about this because we would know eventually this process will work. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=926.0s)]
*  And if they send it back to Judge Chutkin, Judge Chutkin can actually have an evidentiary [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=931.0s)]
*  hearing and actually bring witnesses in in a way that she can't now. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  And so there would then be some actual under oath testimony about all this stuff before [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=940.68s)]
*  the election if they do that. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=946.4399999999999s)]
*  And then eventually you'd get through all this prosecution. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=948.68s)]
*  I actually think Joe Biden is going to be reelected. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=951.92s)]
*  So I'm not terribly concerned about what they're going to do in terms of slowing this thing [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=954.1999999999999s)]
*  down. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=958.8s)]
*  But what you saw, the fundamentals of what you saw and what we discovered clearly today [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=959.8s)]
*  is that there is a group on the Supreme Court who believe that their duty is to protect [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=964.68s)]
*  the Constitution and the law. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=972.9599999999999s)]
*  And there's a possibly larger group who believe their duty is to protect the president, not [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=975.28s)]
*  all presidents, the president named Trump, and that that intensity launches those fever [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=983.16s)]
*  dreams that we heard from Alito and Gorsuch about every president now will make sure that [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=991.8399999999999s)]
*  their predecessor is prosecuted. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1000.5999999999999s)]
*  They were adopting the Trump notion, by the way, that this is a Biden prosecution and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1003.12s)]
*  and that then the next administration will obviously prosecute the previous president. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1009.8s)]
*  To do that, they had to completely ignore the 230 years of history that preceded the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1015.28s)]
*  Donald Trump presidency. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1021.42s)]
*  That all had to be ignored. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1023.18s)]
*  And they did willfully ignore it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1024.62s)]
*  And these are guys who pretend that they're amateur, at least historians who pay attention [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1026.66s)]
*  to all of these things. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1031.42s)]
*  And so it was it was that tortured process. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1033.18s)]
*  But what also emerged really clearly was not a single justice there bought the Trump argument. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1037.78s)]
*  The Trump argument is not for selective immunity. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1044.56s)]
*  It is for absolute immunity. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1047.94s)]
*  And every one of them basically found a way of saying that's ridiculous. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1050.06s)]
*  And the Alito way included that thing that you showed where he kept saying, I'm not talking [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1054.82s)]
*  about these facts. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1060.1399999999999s)]
*  Now, another the good side of that coin is these facts are so bad, I can't talk about [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1061.1399999999999s)]
*  them. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1066.74s)]
*  That's the good side of that. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1067.74s)]
*  I think Thomas may be the exception. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1068.74s)]
*  I think Thomas may think all presidents are criminals and so all presidents need absolute [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1070.1s)]
*  immunity. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1074.1s)]
*  So that's the great mystery. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1075.1s)]
*  Everybody's like me. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1076.1s)]
*  That's the great mystery. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1077.1s)]
*  I think he's talking about himself or maybe his definition of recusal is I will talk the least. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1078.1s)]
*  Clarence Thomas spoke only three times. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1083.1s)]
*  He did not ask. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1086.1s)]
*  He didn't ask a paragraph worth of questions. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1087.1s)]
*  The only thing he raised that was outside of what anyone else mentioned was an issue [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1090.1s)]
*  that wasn't even before the court, which was the legitimacy of the appointment of Jack [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1095.1s)]
*  Smith. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1100.1s)]
*  That's not even before the court. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1101.1s)]
*  And Thomas asked about that. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1102.1s)]
*  So he actually remains the most mysterious on the court today. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1103.1s)]
*  I think as Jenny was showing, I think that we overthink them. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1107.1s)]
*  I think when you work for a president or you work for power, you know that they're just [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1111.1s)]
*  guys and girls. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1115.1s)]
*  And these particular guys consume all of this. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1116.1s)]
*  And I think what was clear today is they will direct quote segments to all of these programs. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1120.1s)]
*  Alito gives speeches in front of conservatives. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1127.1s)]
*  And I'm sure that conservatives in the audience who don't watch any of our programs are like [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1129.1s)]
*  what's he talking about? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1133.1s)]
*  So, folks, paragraphs from all of your scripts I have heard in Alito's rants. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1135.1s)]
*  They are bound to Trump in their feelings of being persecuted to a person. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1139.1s)]
*  And so in Trump's immunity claim, which has myriad legal implications and layers to it, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1147.1s)]
*  they found common cause with the feeling of persecution. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1153.1s)]
*  And that is what they spoke to today. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1157.1s)]
*  That is where he found a receptive audience. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1159.1s)]
*  What's amazing to me as a non-lawyer is that federal judge Carter out in California was [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1161.1s)]
*  like the farther we get, the more murky it gets. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1167.1s)]
*  But in the immediate aftermath, Trump clearly committed the crimes. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1170.1s)]
*  And federal judges said more likely than not he committed felonies. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1174.1s)]
*  He and that Eastman guy. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1178.1s)]
*  And the further we get, the more the people at the highest levels of this branch that [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1179.1s)]
*  everyone said, oh, the court's held, the court's held. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1184.1s)]
*  I think after today we have to get rid of that notion that the court's held. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1186.1s)]
*  And I think after today we have to get rid of the notion that there's some complicated legal theory. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1189.1s)]
*  They just, they feel him. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1194.1s)]
*  They feel persecuted just like he does. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1196.1s)]
*  Yeah, I thought it was a very dark day for the Supreme Court. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1198.1s)]
*  I don't think the conservative justices comported themselves well. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1202.1s)]
*  And to the extent that these arguments have a back and forth, I'm not sure the other side [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1207.1s)]
*  for rule of law moved it back enough. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1211.1s)]
*  And I think this will matter in history because you're going to study some of these precedents. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1214.1s)]
*  By the last time we were all gathered here on a Supreme Court day, it was the Colorado case. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1218.1s)]
*  And the reason legally, not politics legally, that experts would say that was unlikely to go against Trump [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1222.1s)]
*  was that there wasn't any precedent for booting him off the ballot. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1229.1s)]
*  Now we're gathered today, there's zero precedent for this kind of blanket immunity. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1232.1s)]
*  And there's anti-precedent. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1239.1s)]
*  Nixon and others taking pardons and Robert Wray who replaced Ken Starr striking a deal with Bill Clinton [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1240.1s)]
*  on the understanding that otherwise he could be prosecuted. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1246.1s)]
*  Those are, that's bipartisan examples there, different party presidents. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1249.1s)]
*  And against all of that, the test is okay. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1252.1s)]
*  Trump might not benefit as much, but did the rules hold? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1256.1s)]
*  Based on the question, and I agree with your caveat, the rules did not hold for most of the conservative justices. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1260.1s)]
*  Justice Roberts has a slow grade scandal going. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1265.1s)]
*  He's got the money and the corruption on one side, but he's also, the Chief Justice is overseeing [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1270.1s)]
*  an increasingly partisan MAGA court and he can't just stand idly by. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1275.1s)]
*  This is on him as well. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1279.1s)]
*  One more point I did want to share that we didn't get to on official acts. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1280.1s)]
*  There can be potential official acts that would be harder to prosecute. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1283.1s)]
*  None of these are those. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1290.1s)]
*  So the fact that that could happen when you're dealing with war or when you order a drone strike and it kills someone abroad. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1292.1s)]
*  Or the unreviewable pardon authority. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1298.1s)]
*  There's some stuff. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1300.1s)]
*  Or you make an order and it does take an American life and you say, actually, we're not going to deal with it that. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1301.1s)]
*  This is not that. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1306.1s)]
*  I am reminded of the classic Aaron Sorkin line, a co-writer of Lawrence from Social Network. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1307.1s)]
*  If you'd invented Facebook, you would have invented Facebook. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1313.1s)]
*  And if these were official acts, they would be official acts. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1317.1s)]
*  And the reason, as you point out in the excellent opening, that none of the conservative justices wanted to go anywhere near their job, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1320.1s)]
*  which is to review the law and find facts. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1327.1s)]
*  They didn't want to go near the facts that it's not an official act to get people to storm the Capitol and try to assassinate the vice president of the United States who works for you and the Speaker of the House is in the line of succession. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1329.1s)]
*  It's not an official act when you're down by three states and it's all been certified to put in elector fraud, which was indicted again. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1339.1s)]
*  More people yesterday. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1346.1s)]
*  These are anywhere near official acts. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1348.1s)]
*  And I would defend any president, including the former president's right to not have wartime attacks reviewed in domestic court. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1350.1s)]
*  That's not happening. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1358.1s)]
*  And I don't think they need to spin their wheels, pretending that might happen. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1359.1s)]
*  The facts in front of them, they willfully ignored in a way that I'll close by saying, because I did wait my turn, right? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1362.1s)]
*  What depressed me the most is not about the upcoming election or anything political. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1369.1s)]
*  It was seeing multiple justices out themselves as insurrection and sedition minimizers today. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1374.1s)]
*  And it was a sad day. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1382.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1383.1s)]
*  These are not the kinds of activities that I think any of us would think a president needs to engage in in order to fulfill his Article 2 duties. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1384.1s)]
*  And particularly in a case like this one, as applied to this case, the president has no functions with respect to the certification of the winner of the presidential election. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1394.1s)]
*  The states conduct the elections. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1406.1s)]
*  They send electors to certify who won those elections and to provide votes. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1409.1s)]
*  And then Congress in a joint extraordinary joint session certifies the vote. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1416.1s)]
*  And the president doesn't have an official role in that proceeding. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1420.1s)]
*  So it's difficult for me to understand how there could be a serious constitutional question about saying you can't use fraud to defeat that function. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1424.1s)]
*  You can't obstruct it through deception. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1435.1s)]
*  You can't deprive millions of voters of their right to have their vote counted for the candidate who they chose. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1438.1s)]
*  Thank you, counsel. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1444.1s)]
*  Thank you, counsel. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1445.1s)]
*  Welcome back to our primetime recap of today's Supreme Court proceedings on whether President Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for actions he took as president. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1447.1s)]
*  It is also our primetime recap of the first full day of testimony from the blockbuster lead witness in the criminal trial of that same former president, which is ongoing right now in New York. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1457.1s)]
*  We're going to we still have New York to get to. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1468.1s)]
*  But on that point from the Supreme Court arguments today, that discussion at the top there from Michael Dreeben, lawyer for the special counsel's office that has brought the federal prosecution against Trump for trying to stay in office after he lost the election. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1471.1s)]
*  Dreeben is engaging there with the question of what counts as an official act by a president versus what's an unofficial act by a president. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1484.1s)]
*  The reason he was engaging with that is because the conservative justices today is Katie Fang, who was there just was telling us the conservative justice today kept putting that forward as the most important thing to be derived from today's argument. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1494.1s)]
*  The next thing they wanted to do, the next step they wanted to take in this case. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1507.1s)]
*  Not incidentally a time consuming started all over kind of step that would have the practical effect of making absolutely sure that there's no chance Donald Trump stands trial before the election. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1512.1s)]
*  That is what the Trump side wants. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1524.1s)]
*  That seems to be what the hardline conservatives on the Supreme Court want as well. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1526.1s)]
*  But while those conservative justices today were demanding that lawyers for both sides dance on the head of this particularly stupid pin. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1531.1s)]
*  The more liberal justices did use today's proceedings to try to spell out what is just bluntly wrong with that. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1540.1s)]
*  What seems crazy to normal people about the broadest strokes of what Trump is trying to do here. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1547.1s)]
*  If there's no criminal prosecution, if there's no threat of criminal prosecution, what prevents the president from just doing whatever he wants? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1557.1s)]
*  All the structural checks that are identified in Fitzgerald and a whole series of his court's cases that go back to Martin against Mott, for example, impeachment, oversight by Congress, public oversight. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1564.1s)]
*  There's a long series that Fitzgerald directly addresses this in the civil context and we think that language naturally ports to the federal court. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1574.1s)]
*  I'm not sure that that's much of a backstop and what I'm I guess more worried about. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1580.1s)]
*  You seem to be worried about the president being chilled. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1585.1s)]
*  I think that we would have a really significant opposite problem if the president wasn't chilled. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1588.1s)]
*  If someone with those kinds of powers, the most powerful person in the world with the greatest amount of authority could go into office knowing that there would be no potential penalty for committing crimes. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1594.1s)]
*  I'm trying to understand what the disincentive is from turning the Oval Office into the seat of criminal activity in this country. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1610.1s)]
*  I don't think there's any allegation of that in this case. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1620.1s)]
*  And what George Washington said is what Benjamin Franklin said is we view the prosecution of a chief executive is something that everybody cried out against is unconstitutional. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1623.1s)]
*  And what George Washington said is we're worried about factional strife, which will. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1631.1s)]
*  No, no, I'm also let me let me let me put this worry on the table. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1636.1s)]
*  If the potential for criminal liability is taken off the table, wouldn't there be a significant risk that future presidents would be emboldened to commit crimes with abandon while they're in office? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1639.1s)]
*  It's right now the fact that we're having this debate because OLC has said that presidents might be prosecuted. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1652.1s)]
*  Presidents from the beginning of time have understood that that's a possibility. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1660.1s)]
*  That might be what has kept this office from turning into the kind of crime center that I'm envisioning. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1664.1s)]
*  But once we say no criminal liability, Mr. President, you can do whatever you want. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1671.1s)]
*  I'm worried that we would have a worse problem than the problem of the president feeling constrained to follow the law while he's in office. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1677.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1686.1s)]
*  Let me put this worry on the table. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1690.1s)]
*  She says Justice Katanji Brown Jackson today speaking plainly, taking a step back to see the larger picture today. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1692.1s)]
*  You keep saying how terrible it would be if the president was put on trial for his crimes. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1699.1s)]
*  Can we also talk about how terrible his crimes would be and how terrible it would be for the presidency and for the country going forward? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1703.1s)]
*  If all future presidents knew they can commit any crime they want and there's nothing anyone can do about it. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1711.1s)]
*  Chris Hayes, I was worried your head was going to fall. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1719.1s)]
*  Well, because I had the same experience listening to our arguments. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1722.1s)]
*  I was like, yes, yes, yes, exactly. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1725.1s)]
*  And partly it's because Sauer, Trump's lawyer, and Trump himself and some of the conservative justices all seem to be agreeing on what we call the dirty, hairy model of the American presidency, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1727.1s)]
*  which is like you got to be tough and maybe you got to break some legs and maybe you got to shoot some bad guys and like, what are you going to do? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1738.1s)]
*  Bring your lawyers against me? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1744.1s)]
*  Like that was a consistent theme today. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1746.1s)]
*  They kept saying, Sauer kept saying, like bold and decisive action. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1749.1s)]
*  And one of the things Katanji Brown Jackson brought up, which was another highlight of hers, which sort of pairs with that point, she's like, bro, there's lots of people with tough jobs out there. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1752.1s)]
*  Governors, there's the people that run the Pentagon. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1760.1s)]
*  They all might face criminal prosecution. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1763.1s)]
*  Somehow they managed to do their jobs. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1765.1s)]
*  And actually, isn't it probably good that like they're going to do something and they go to their lawyer, they'll be like, well, I get thrown in jail for this. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1767.1s)]
*  But that seems like a good check. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1773.1s)]
*  And I had to say, like, I was listening to that as someone who came up as a reporter in Illinois where like four of 11 governors went to prison. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1775.1s)]
*  It was good that you might go end up in jail if, for instance, you sold commercial driver's licenses for bribes as a former governor did when he was secretary of state. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1781.1s)]
*  Like those were official acts. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1792.1s)]
*  But yeah, that sort of Damocles hanging over your head, probably a useful restraint when wielding great power. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1794.1s)]
*  Alex Wagner, can I just talk about, I mean, the first clip that you played, the idea that as what did Sauer say, the official stuff has to be expunged. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1800.1s)]
*  We need to have a separation here between the private acts and the official acts. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1809.1s)]
*  A, I think it's quite clearly a delay tactic. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1812.1s)]
*  But B, it does have me worried that this is the most likely outcome here, that this remanded back to the district court and this whole new series of tests arises about what part of this is official, what part of it is private. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1815.1s)]
*  I do worry about the integrity of the case that the prosecution's put forward here. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1825.1s)]
*  And they sort of articulated that in court today, too. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1829.1s)]
*  Drebben from the prosecution basically says this is an integrated conspiracy here, right? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1832.1s)]
*  It has different components. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1838.1s)]
*  And you know, it's Donald Trump working with private lawyers to achieve the goals of the fraud. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1840.1s)]
*  Once you start to unwind that arbitrarily, I guess, if the district court must, into separating private and official conduct, assuming any of it is official, I do worry about what that means for the case writ large. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1846.1s)]
*  Oh yeah. And it slows it down for sure. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1859.1s)]
*  And it may kill it altogether. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1861.1s)]
*  Well, and like if this, if Lawrence is right and there's a very likely possibility that Joe Biden wins in this, you know, this ends up going to trial, you do have to think about, okay, what actually is the meaningful impact of this if it does see a court? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1862.1s)]
*  And also, don't we have to at some point answer the question that was asked? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1875.1s)]
*  And that's what Katanji Brown Jackson and Justice Jackson kept saying. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1879.1s)]
*  Shouldn't we actually answer the question, does a president have blanket immunity? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1882.1s)]
*  They seem they were going all around trying not to answer it, but we actually need the answer to it because to your point, Matt and Rachel, now that we've given the theoreticals of a coup, killing your opponent, bribery, treason, murder, now that we've put it on the table where Trump can hear it, where he can see it and find it, don't we need to know just in case he becomes president whether he can kill people? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1887.1s)]
*  Because he now knows that in theory, he's got four or five people on the court who think maybe he can. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1909.1s)]
*  And the argument about that today was, well, we'll carve out an area of private acts only. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1915.1s)]
*  And those ones, and those ones they can be prosecuted for eventually someday. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1921.1s)]
*  But it's going to be an elaborate test. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1926.1s)]
*  We're going to have to go back to the beginning. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1928.1s)]
*  And don't forget, you have to do impeachment and conviction before you can get to criminal prosecution. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1929.1s)]
*  Which has never happened in the history of the United States. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1935.1s)]
*  Ergo, the reason why they're creating even more of a higher, more impossible bar, it's not just put it there. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1937.1s)]
*  That's a non-starter, Joy. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1942.1s)]
*  You mentioned you're not a lawyer. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1943.1s)]
*  No. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1944.1s)]
*  But you sound like a good lawyer. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1945.1s)]
*  Because that's what happens at the Supreme Court. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1946.1s)]
*  There's a question presented. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1949.1s)]
*  And it says, to what extent does a former president have presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1950.1s)]
*  Now, that word alleged is doing a lot of work. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1961.1s)]
*  This question was already written. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1965.1s)]
*  It was the first clue. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1966.1s)]
*  Andrew Weissman and others mentioned this when we saw it. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1967.1s)]
*  It was the first clue they were leaning towards Trump. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1969.1s)]
*  If you can allege your way, meaning it's not really an official act, you just allege it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1971.1s)]
*  Well, anyone can allege anything. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1976.1s)]
*  If you watch the news or follow the law, I'm sure you've heard about that. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1978.1s)]
*  What we're doing here is testing the evidence. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1981.1s)]
*  There's been overwhelming evidence, which is why Jack Smith got this far. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1984.1s)]
*  It's why he won this case at the district level. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1987.1s)]
*  It's why he won it at the D.C. circuit unanimously in a bipartisan set of appointees. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1989.1s)]
*  The evidence has already been established to some degree. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1994.1s)]
*  It doesn't mean Trump's guilty, but it means we're past that point. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1996.1s)]
*  If anyone can allege their way around, then this question and the test that the conservatives are pushing won't protect America. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=1999.1s)]
*  How do you separate it? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=2007.1s)]
*  Giving out pardons is an official act the president is allowed to do. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=2008.1s)]
*  It's an Article 2 power. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=2011.1s)]
*  But if he sells the pardon and takes a bribe for the pardon, is it an official act? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=2013.1s)]
*  The bribe part is private, but the pardon is not. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=2017.1s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=2021.1s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=2022.1s)]
*  You have to take a holistic view of the integrative forms of behavior. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=2023.1s)]
*  This isn't splitting the baby, it's splitting the knife. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=2029.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stO8VlfLS38&t=2052.1s)]
