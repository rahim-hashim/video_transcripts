# 'We're a country of no kings': Rep. Frost talks walking out on Trump's speech
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0)
*  Joining us now is one of the Democrats who actually walked out of the speech tonight, Florida Democratic Congressman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=0.0s)]
*  Maxwell Frost. We saw him leave the House chamber. He took off his jacket. You could see the t-shirt [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  He was wearing over his dress shirt. It says no kings live here [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=11.6s)]
*  Congressman frost really appreciate you making time to be with us tonight. Thank you [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=16.56s)]
*  Of course, thanks for having me on tell us about the decision to to wear that shirt and to to walk out at the moment [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=20.56s)]
*  you did [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  I think it's important for people to see that their leaders understand that this is not a normal moment [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=27.76s)]
*  We're in the middle of a billionaire [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=32.08s)]
*  Administrative takeover and coup of our country where they want to cut medicaid cut social security cut medicare [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=35.34s)]
*  Cut all the things that we fought for and earned in order to give tax breaks to billionaires and corporations [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=42.64s)]
*  It's not a new story for this country, but it is the most overt [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=49.2s)]
*  I think it's ever been and so I in the spirit of being a member of the congressional black caucus [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  But also coming from organizing decided to do a walk out with a group of members [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Wearing a message that not only you know, the press could see but that the president could see he calls himself a king [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=62.31999999999999s)]
*  But we're a country of no kings [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=67.84s)]
*  Especially when these kings want to do nothing for the people and take all the money and give it to themselves [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  That's exactly what donald trump wants to do. Let me let me ask about that the specificity of the message there [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=73.84s)]
*  I mean one of the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=79.6s)]
*  Issues that I think the country is sort of having a hard time [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=82.0s)]
*  Calibrating like getting a sense of like how how big is this? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=85.17999999999999s)]
*  How different is this from previous political confrontations? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=88.08s)]
*  We've had between people with different ideas about the way the government should run or what we should be doing with our money [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=91.44s)]
*  I think one of the things that people just can't grasp is the king idea right the king idea is not just the unitary [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=96.8s)]
*  Presidency, right? It's not just about consolidating power over the executive branch [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=103.58s)]
*  The idea of a king which is what you had on your back of your shirt is that you've got a unitary power [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=108.88s)]
*  That the congress is decorative or beside the point or could be abolished and there and nothing would happen that the courts [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=115.36s)]
*  Are decorative the courts are there to essentially ratify what the ruler wants to do and that the rule of law [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=122.24s)]
*  Is really just the rule of the ruler and the law can be dressed up [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=128.24s)]
*  To occasion whatever it is. He wants is that the scale? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=133.12s)]
*  Of threat to this country that you think we are literally up against or is this a hyperbolic charge? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=137.76s)]
*  It's not hyperbolic at all and this is shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. That is all in project 2025 [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=144.16s)]
*  Donald trump is the president, but he is also the speaker of the house effectively. He has an entire [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=149.68s)]
*  Republican congress that is allowing him to do whatever he wants [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=155.66s)]
*  None of them utter a peep against what he's saying unless their town halls are stormed and either they're running out or they say [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  Maybe I disapprove a little bit but donald trump has complete control over the republicans in congress [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=165.44000000000003s)]
*  And so what the founder set out to do is have a congress and have a presidency that were co-equal [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  Branches of government checks on one another checks and balances, but we don't have that right now [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=176.72000000000003s)]
*  We have one person who runs the congress because he runs the entire majority [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  One of the things that we saw in the democratic response from senator slotkin was an interesting choice [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm, not sure i've ever seen anything like this before and you talk about your organizing background [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=193.52s)]
*  She sort of raised the alarm a little bit along the lines that you were talking about tonight [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=198.0s)]
*  And then said as a cia officer, which is her past her [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  That she's seen democracies flicker out in other parts of the world and then she gave americans a list of things they can do [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  To try to hold on to our democracy talking about contacting their member of congress [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=214.08s)]
*  Joining groups that are working to try to hold on to our democracy [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  She said pointedly if there isn't a group that you feel like is in your area or among people who you know [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=222.0s)]
*  Is doing the work that you think ought to be done ought to be done [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=227.84s)]
*  You need to found that group you need to start that yourself very pointed organizing message from a member of congress [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=230.56s)]
*  Who's not thought of as a real radical [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=236.24s)]
*  I wonder if that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=238.24s)]
*  If I get your reaction to that and if you add anything to add in terms of what you think [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=240.32s)]
*  People within the sound of your voice ought to be doing right now given the the dire prospects that you see for the country [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=245.2s)]
*  Okay [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=250.16s)]
*  I had a town hall about a week and a half ago when we put out the link [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=251.28s)]
*  Within four hours of one email we had over 600 rcps [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=255.28s)]
*  And at this standing room only town hall there was the message was clear from everybody two things [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  They wanted to learn about how serious and dire the situation is and two they wanted to be put to work [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=265.2s)]
*  And as someone who comes from organizing background march for our lives and other organizations [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=270.88s)]
*  It is a gold mine when the people contact you and say what can I do? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=274.98s)]
*  You know [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=280.98s)]
*  I I come from you know [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=281.46s)]
*  I come from going to people and knocking on their doors and begging them to volunteer [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=282.82s)]
*  Begging them to get involved and now the people are saying put us to work [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=286.82s)]
*  We want to fight for our democracy for our country for medicare for medicaid for programs that help and that working people have earned [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=290.34s)]
*  And so I think it is important to make sure people know that the united states our democracy can break [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=297.46s)]
*  We can lose it if we don't defend it and and fascism and authoritarians [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=304.5s)]
*  They gain power when there is no opposition. That's part of the reason i've told people you have to make the decision [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=309.62s)]
*  Are we the minority or are we the opposition? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=314.98s)]
*  Because I do believe an authoritarian can take hold when it's just a minority [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=317.86s)]
*  But when there's a strong opposition we can fight it back and we can come back stronger than ever [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=322.18s)]
*  And so I I agree with giving people something to do but first off you got to explain to people how serious the situation is [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  congressman maxwell frost one of a number of democrats who [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWJEAeYt4e0&t=334.02000000000004s)]
