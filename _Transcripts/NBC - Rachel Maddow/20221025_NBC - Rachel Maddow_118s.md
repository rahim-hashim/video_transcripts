# How To Follow A Podcast (Like Rachel Maddow Presents: Ultra)
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 25, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4)
*  Have you met my old friend Norma Lundin? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=0.0s)]
*  She was the wife of a U.S. senator who died in a very mysterious plane crash in 1940. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=4.0s)]
*  That mysterious plane crash is what starts episode one of my new podcast, which is called Rachel Maddow Presents Ultra. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=10.0s)]
*  Episode one is where you get to meet Senator Ernest Lundin, Norma's husband. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=18.0s)]
*  Episode four is just out as of today. That's the one where you get to meet Norma, the senator's wife. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=23.0s)]
*  If you're like me, the sound of her voice will start haunting your dreams once you have heard it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=28.0s)]
*  You can get Ultra for free wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=33.0s)]
*  If you have been wondering where one gets a podcast, don't feel bad. Don't be shy. It happens. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=36.0s)]
*  Personally, I get mine using my iPhone through the very basic podcasts app that they put on your phone automatically, even if you've never used it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=43.0s)]
*  There's a little purple square that says podcasts. Just tap that square, open the app, search for Ultra, and Ultra Maddow should pop up as a suggestion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=51.0s)]
*  Go ahead and tap on that. Tap again on the podcast and then you get it for free. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=60.0s)]
*  You get the episode sent to that podcast app on your phone every week. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=65.0s)]
*  You just tap on the little plus sign in the upper right hand corner that has you following the show, and then you get every new episode when it comes out each week. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=68.0s)]
*  Scroll down through the episodes, pick the one you want. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=76.0s)]
*  I recommend starting with the first one. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=79.0s)]
*  But if you want to treat yourself to the one that we just published today, I'm telling you Norma's voice is a thing of wild and furious wonder that will keep you awake for days. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=82.0s)]
*  New episode today. Another episode. New episode will come out next Monday. You can get it wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB6tnRQien4&t=91.0s)]
