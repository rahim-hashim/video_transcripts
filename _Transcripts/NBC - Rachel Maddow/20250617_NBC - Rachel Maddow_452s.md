# After massive 'No Kings' protests, where does the Trump opposition go from here?
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84)
*  Brand new polling from NBC News shows that more voters disapprove of President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=0.0s)]
*  than approve of him by double digits. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=4.64s)]
*  He's underwater by 10 points. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  This is interesting. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Among people who like Donald Trump, who really, really like him, they're starting to not like [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  him as much anymore. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=14.24s)]
*  Among Republicans, the percentage of them who say they are most enthusiastic about Trump, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=15.64s)]
*  they're thrilled by Trump, that number of Republicans has dropped seven points since [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=20.32s)]
*  the last time this poll was taken in April. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=24.66s)]
*  Even among self-identified, not just Republicans, but self-identified MAGA supporters, the percentage [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=27.52s)]
*  of them who call themselves thrilled with Trump has dropped nine points just since April. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=32.72s)]
*  People who really like him don't even like him as much anymore. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=39.96s)]
*  There's a significant gap in enthusiasm right now between the people who are fired up in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  support of what Trump is doing and the people who are really fired up against him and also [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=46.8s)]
*  ready to go out into the streets to say so. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=50.88s)]
*  The question is, what's the best strategy for this opposition movement going forward? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=53.6s)]
*  Is there something that we can learn from other countries or from our own history that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=58.92s)]
*  can help? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  At the flagship No Kings protest in Philly on Saturday, more than 100,000 people turned [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=63.38s)]
*  out in Philly alone. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=68.3s)]
*  Historian Tim Snyder addressed the crowd. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=69.3s)]
*  He urged everybody who came out to protest in Philly not to view protesting itself as [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=71.64s)]
*  the end goal, but to view it as the start of something bigger and more sustained. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=76.0s)]
*  We make a new friend here today and we do something with them tomorrow. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=82.68s)]
*  We meet somebody we admire today and we do something with them tomorrow. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=87.84s)]
*  We meet somebody who's a little more courageous than us today and we do something with them [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=92.78s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=97.56s)]
*  Today, no kings, tomorrow freedom. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=98.56s)]
*  There is a better America out there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=102.64s)]
*  There is a better America underneath. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=105.64s)]
*  There is a better America that we can see. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=108.32s)]
*  There is a better America that we can make. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=111.04s)]
*  History is in our hands. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=113.92s)]
*  No kings, freedom. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=122.68s)]
*  No kings, freedom. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=125.2s)]
*  No kings, freedom. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=127.48s)]
*  Joining us now is Timothy Snyder, history professor, the author of On Tyranny, and several [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  other books about the rise of authoritarianism and indeed on freedom. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=136.36s)]
*  Professor Snyder, it's really nice to see you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=140.76s)]
*  Thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  So glad. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  Given your scholarship on authoritarianism and on democracies that have gone the way [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  of authoritarian overthrow, what's your take on the state of the opposition to Trump right [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=153.16s)]
*  now in the United States, the strength and the healthiness of this movement? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=159.32s)]
*  So I would say we were a little bit slow out of the gate for the first few months. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=166.44s)]
*  It was, let's face it, foreigners and bond markets and the internal contradictions of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=171.92s)]
*  the Trump position. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=178.6s)]
*  But I think we turned a corner in April. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  I think we're gaining speed now with these last protests, which if they weren't the biggest [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=182.8s)]
*  in U.S. history, were awfully darn close. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=187.16s)]
*  We had about five million people out, which is 50 or probably 100 times as many as Trump [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=190.36s)]
*  had out at his birthday parade or whatever that was. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=197.08s)]
*  I think we're at a moment where, as you say, we've got people, we've got energy, we have [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=201.24s)]
*  creativity, we've got some courage, and it's time to think about what to learn from the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=207.4s)]
*  past and what to do next. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=212.28000000000003s)]
*  What should we learn from what we've done as a country in the past, from what other [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=216.08s)]
*  countries have done facing similar challenges? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=220.5s)]
*  Is there, I know every circumstance is unique and every would-be tyrant has his own spin [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=223.02s)]
*  on things, but is there, are there sort of, I don't know, bright lines that we should [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=228.22s)]
*  be aware of in terms of what works, what doesn't work, better directions to head at this point [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=233.9s)]
*  in the evolution of this kind of a movement? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=241.68s)]
*  One thing is that the unpredictability is part of the solution. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=245.78s)]
*  It's going to look ways that no one person foresees. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=249.94s)]
*  Neither you nor I nor any of the specialists on this are going to predict exactly what [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=252.82s)]
*  it looks like, and the unpredictability is actually part of the winning strategy. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=257.72s)]
*  You can't plan everything. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=261.7s)]
*  You can't button everything down. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=262.98s)]
*  New and interesting things are going to happen. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=265.42s)]
*  That's one thing we learned from the history of social movements. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=266.98s)]
*  They don't move like robots. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=269.02s)]
*  They move like collections of human beings doing new things. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=270.38s)]
*  That's a second point. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=273.82s)]
*  It has to be about the future. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=275.0s)]
*  It can be about the present to some extent, right, like the no kings, you're against something, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=277.32s)]
*  but it has to largely be about the present. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=282.06s)]
*  You have to give people a sense that things can get better, much better, because, and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=283.92s)]
*  that's true, they certainly can. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=288.64s)]
*  A third thing to remember is that these things work as coalitions. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=291.32s)]
*  So it's not us and them. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=295.24s)]
*  It has to be people that we don't agree with about everything. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=297.96s)]
*  It has to be people where they're protesting for their first time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  It also has to include some people who were on the other side, who voted for Trump. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=305.14s)]
*  Those are some basic things, and the coalition point comes through very strongly from U.S. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=310.74s)]
*  history. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  In U.S. history, when we have become more democratic, like with the women's suffrage [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=315.58000000000004s)]
*  movement or with the civil rights movement, there have been people responding to a crisis, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=318.46000000000004s)]
*  and then they had allies who listened to them. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=322.94s)]
*  In terms of nonviolence, obviously we all know that nonviolent movements are more successful [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=326.82s)]
*  than violent movements. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=331.92s)]
*  There's not going to be a civil war in this country, and this isn't going to be settled [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=332.92s)]
*  by military force. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=336.34s)]
*  Talking about building a sustainable commitment to nonviolence and building up people's skills [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=339.3s)]
*  and resilience in terms of being nonviolent, especially as Trump tries to increase the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=345.1s)]
*  specter of violence being associated with political dissent, are there any sort of guardrails [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=350.02s)]
*  or bright lines that we should be thinking about in terms of how to build that? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=355.06s)]
*  Obviously we have the recent history of the civil rights movement to draw on with its [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=359.18s)]
*  richness and its spiritual basis in terms of teaching that and leading in that way. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=362.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=368.54s)]
*  I just want to say a couple comforting things here. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=369.54s)]
*  The first is that they know that the moment that they reach out in that direction, they're [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=371.98s)]
*  going to lose. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=377.54s)]
*  This is not a society where you can seriously imagine that using the military or using [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=378.54s)]
*  other organs of force to kill Americans is going to lead to something good for Donald [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=384.74s)]
*  Trump. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=389.42s)]
*  He knows that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=390.42s)]
*  The armed forces know it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=391.42s)]
*  We all know that that's a losing strategy, not just a horrible moral catastrophe, but [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  also a losing strategy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=399.02s)]
*  The second comforting thing that I want to say is that nonviolence, it isn't an absence. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=400.90000000000003s)]
*  It's a presence. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=406.1s)]
*  It's a way of being. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  It's the little bit of courage which gets you out there doing something unfamiliar. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=409.68s)]
*  It's a little bit of courage that allows you to talk to somebody you didn't know before. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=413.62s)]
*  It's that little bit more of openness that you have in a moment like this rather than [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=417.9s)]
*  a little bit more of being closed. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=421.58s)]
*  Nonviolence isn't just stopping yourself from being violent. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=424.06s)]
*  It's also a kind of openness to participate in things, which leaves you feeling better [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=426.76s)]
*  afterwards. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAXSHIlHs84&t=431.02s)]
