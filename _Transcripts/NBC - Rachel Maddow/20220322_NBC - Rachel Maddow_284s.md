# Anti-Corruption Activists Tied To Navalny Expose Putin Ownership Of Mystery Yacht
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o)
*  I want to start tonight by talking about some really expensive boats. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=0.0s)]
*  Now the thing about buying a super yacht is that it is a pretty difficult purchase to hide. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=5.0s)]
*  This one that you're looking at is called the Azam. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=11.0s)]
*  It's believed to be the largest yacht in the entire world. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=14.0s)]
*  This one, the Al-Sayed, is owned by the Sultan of Oman. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=18.0s)]
*  Steven Spielberg owns a yacht. His is called the Seven Seas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=23.0s)]
*  In fact, if you run down the list of the world's biggest, most lavish mansions of the sea, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=28.0s)]
*  they all have super rich, super well connected owners. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=33.0s)]
*  Heck, they all have owners, period. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=38.0s)]
*  Except for one yacht. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=41.0s)]
*  This is the Shaharazah. It is more than 450 feet long. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=44.0s)]
*  It's worth more than $700 million. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=49.0s)]
*  Look at it. It's got six floors, multiple swimming pools, a wood-burning stove, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=52.0s)]
*  and two helipads, because you know it's costly to keep one helicopter hovering while it waits to unload more guests. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=57.0s)]
*  It is tricked out with a piano that plays itself, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=64.0s)]
*  and a pool table that's on some kind of a tilting device so it reduces the impact of the waves. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=68.0s)]
*  But the most bizarre thing about this yacht is that no one is quite sure who owns it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=74.0s)]
*  The vessel has no publicly registered owner. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=81.0s)]
*  Right now it's just chilling at a port in Italy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=85.0s)]
*  As western countries start the race to round up all these super yachts that are owned by Russian billionaires [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=88.0s)]
*  to sanction them and seize their assets for their support of Russia's invasion in Ukraine, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=94.0s)]
*  journalists have been trying to figure out to whom the Shaharazad might belong. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=100.0s)]
*  And now, after a lot of speculation, we seem to be much closer to an answer. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=106.0s)]
*  These two Russian anti-corruption activists have just released an incredibly detailed report [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=112.0s)]
*  that they say proves that the owner of this mystery super yacht is not just any Russian billionaire, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=118.0s)]
*  but Vladimir Putin himself. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=124.0s)]
*  The activists obtained documents that show the names, the passport numbers, of the crew that works on this yacht. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=127.0s)]
*  Except for the captain, every single person who works on the boat is Russian, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=133.0s)]
*  which isn't unusual in and of itself, but many of them are employed by Russia's Federal Protective Service, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=138.0s)]
*  the FSO, which is essentially Russia's version of the Secret Service. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=145.0s)]
*  The people who staff this yacht happen to be the same people who are listed as Vladimir Putin's security guards [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=150.0s)]
*  and his personal staff. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=156.0s)]
*  Now, imagine if it turned out that a mystery boat off the coast of Delaware was teaming with Secret Service agents [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=159.0s)]
*  who also happened to be on President Biden's security detail. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=165.0s)]
*  The logical assumption would be that that was Biden's boat. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=170.0s)]
*  That's the same case that these activists are making. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=175.0s)]
*  These activists have done this kind of expose before on Vladimir Putin and people close to him. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=178.0s)]
*  Take a look at the neon sign hanging behind him, behind them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=183.0s)]
*  It says, Navalny, as in Alexei Navalny, Russia's primary opposition leader who was poisoned [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=187.0s)]
*  and almost murdered by the Russian government. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=193.0s)]
*  Alexei Navalny is currently serving a prison sentence on bogus charges. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=196.0s)]
*  His original sentence was about three years and it was meant to expire next year. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=200.0s)]
*  Well, today, a Russian judge added nine more years to his sentence, again, based on trumped up charges meant to silence him. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=206.0s)]
*  This new sentence allows officials to move him to a more remote high security prison, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=215.0s)]
*  which will make it more difficult for him to communicate with his family and his lawyers and his supporters who are legion. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=220.0s)]
*  And yet here are Navalny's fellow pro-democracy advocates doing the diligent work of uncovering corruption in the Russian government. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=228.0s)]
*  Because at this point, it doesn't really matter how long Putin keeps Navalny in jail. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=237.0s)]
*  These activists ended the video by saying, quote, Subscribe to this channel. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=243.0s)]
*  We tell the truth here. Free Navalny. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=247.0s)]
*  What Navalny started has led legs. It's got deep roots. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=250.0s)]
*  The anti-Putin anti-corruption anti-war movement in Russia is strong and growing, even with its strongest leader behind bars. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q47E9nAHT0o&t=254.0s)]
