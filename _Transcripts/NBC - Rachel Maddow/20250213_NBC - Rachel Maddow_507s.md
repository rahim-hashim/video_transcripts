# Gov. Hochul giving new consideration to removing NYC Mayor Adams amid crisis at DOJ
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE)
*  and joining us now live is Governor Kathy Hochul of New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=0.0s)]
*  Governor, I really appreciate you making time to be here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=3.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=5.2s)]
*  Tell us about this decision that you made when you received this extradition order from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=6.2s)]
*  Louisiana. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=11.9s)]
*  How should people in this country expect this case to move forward? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=12.9s)]
*  How do you expect the Louisiana governor to respond? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  We put this in place as soon as we heard about the overturning of Roby Wade. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=19.68s)]
*  I need to protect our doctors because telemedicine is the number one reason people can get abortion [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  pills. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=28.92s)]
*  The concerns of all abortions are now by pills, and they've been approved by the FDA for [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=29.92s)]
*  20 years. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=33.72s)]
*  It's safe. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=34.72s)]
*  We have a doctor who's trying to help someone in another state who's been denied the right [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=35.72s)]
*  of control over her own body, just doing what her oath requires her to do. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=39.84s)]
*  And now she's treated like a criminal. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=44.44s)]
*  It was not a tough decision for me, Rachel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=46.28s)]
*  I said no and hell no. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=48.160000000000004s)]
*  I will never, ever send this person to harm's way to stand for 15 years of possible jail [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=49.96s)]
*  time for just being a doctor. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=56.06s)]
*  And that's what our countries come to. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=59.0s)]
*  This is the ripple effect of the overturning of Roby Wade and the stacking of the Supreme [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  Court under the last of Trump administration. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=64.52s)]
*  My mother's generation fought for these rights. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=67.8s)]
*  My generation was able to take them for granted, and they're not there for my daughter's generation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=70.4s)]
*  My God, we've got to stand up and fight and let these women know. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=75.92s)]
*  And I'm sorry for the sisters in these states where they're being repressed, but we should [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=79.44s)]
*  not allow government-mandated pregnancies. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=83.66s)]
*  That's what happens when women don't have control over their own bodies. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=87.28s)]
*  So we're always proud to stand up for women's rights here in the state of New York. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=89.64s)]
*  I feel like I've been both anticipating this for a long time because of the way—because [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=93.88s)]
*  you signed that shield law, because you knew this was coming, but I also feel very unsettled [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=99.64s)]
*  by the fact that it's on us. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=103.68s)]
*  I really don't know how this is going to resolve. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=104.68s)]
*  I presume that you're expecting this to end up in federal court, potentially with the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=107.08s)]
*  Supreme Court deciding the strength of your shield law versus the strength of Louisiana [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=113.24s)]
*  or potentially Texas's ability to take action against this New York doctor despite the shield. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  Is that where you think this is going? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=123.88s)]
*  I believe it is because what they've set up was by saying this goes back to the individual [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=125.32s)]
*  states. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=129.84s)]
*  Well, I have to stand up for my state laws. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=130.84s)]
*  The law that I signed in 2022 and again updated in 2023 says I have a responsibility, a legal [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=132.68s)]
*  responsibility to protect this doctor and other providers who are exercising this form [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=139.04s)]
*  of care for women even out of state. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=143.96s)]
*  So yes, it'll probably end up in another judicial litigation situation, but we can't [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=146.16s)]
*  just roll over and play dead here, Rachel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=152.08s)]
*  I mean, what are we supposed to do? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=153.56s)]
*  Let this happen? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=154.8s)]
*  No, we've got to fight for these rights. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=155.8s)]
*  This is the place where the women's rights movement started in 1848. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=158.2s)]
*  We had reproductive rights passed by a Republican governor and Republican legislature three [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=162.98s)]
*  years before Roe v. Wade. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  Let's look at that history and have people start saying, my God, how did this happen? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=170.16s)]
*  We cannot have this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=175.04s)]
*  And as a governor, I will always stand up for the people of my state. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=176.04s)]
*  New York is also leading the way with a number of other Democratic led states in challenging [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=180.12s)]
*  some of the initial actions of the Trump administration. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=185.76s)]
*  Day one, challenging the birth right, the effort to take away birthright citizenship, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=188.48s)]
*  the access by Elon Musk and his sort of kids to get into the Treasury payment system among [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  a number of other lawsuits. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=200.28s)]
*  New York is taking on with other states the burden of litigation to try to stop them. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=203.2s)]
*  Do you do you see that as essentially the major clash in this country, the best legal [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=208.2s)]
*  footing the Democrats have in terms of trying to stop them in the courts? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=214.12s)]
*  It's truly all we have. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=218.84s)]
*  As sad as that sounds, I served as a member of Congress when the House was Republicans, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=220.56s)]
*  but we had Democratic leaders in the Senate. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=224.67999999999998s)]
*  So there's always this firewall to stop crazy from happening. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=227.16s)]
*  We don't have that anymore. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=230.72s)]
*  I work so hard to elect enough Democrats to make Hakeem Jeffries, the speaker, just to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=231.72s)]
*  be a counterbalance. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=236.56s)]
*  If we ended up with Donald Trump in the White House, we came as far as we could in New York. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=237.56s)]
*  Other states didn't get there. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  This is what we have to focus on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=243.89999999999998s)]
*  Twenty twenty six is right around the corner. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  We as Democratic governors need the reinforcements to stop this in Washington. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=247.6s)]
*  But until that time, we are it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=252.8s)]
*  And we have a lot of bold, courageous leaders. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=255.36s)]
*  They're great friends of mine. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=257.4s)]
*  And the message that I want to deliver, we're not going to have a hair on fire every moment. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=259.08s)]
*  There's too much incoming and you lose your credibility with the American people if they [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=263.76s)]
*  think all you're trying to do is attack, attack, attack, attack. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, if the Trump administration wants to roll up their sleeves and work with me to make [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=271.08s)]
*  New York City great again, help me invest in the subway system, make the subway system [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=275.0s)]
*  up to extend the second subway up to Harlem so communities of color can have a shorter [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=280.72s)]
*  commute to the money jobs down in Wall Street. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=286.0s)]
*  You have my attention. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=289.04s)]
*  I'll work with you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=290.04s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to do and fight for congestion pricing, which I wasn't sure how [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=291.04s)]
*  it would work. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=294.48s)]
*  Rachel, people are getting around the city with ease and more of the commuters are coming [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=295.48s)]
*  in saying, my ride, I shaved 20, 30 minutes and that is worth the cost. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=298.84s)]
*  These are areas I'm happy to work with the Trump administration. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=303.48s)]
*  So it's not all anti everything. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=306.36s)]
*  But you come after any of the rights that we take for granted in our state. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=308.72s)]
*  Now you've got to fight on your hands. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=312.88s)]
*  Let me ask you about this drama involving Mayor Eric Adams and the corruption charges [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=315.04s)]
*  against him. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=318.48s)]
*  What we've just seen with the resignation of the U.S. attorney, the Trump appointed [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=320.04s)]
*  acting U.S. attorney, the removal of line prosecutors on that case, the demand from [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  justice to drop that case, the refusal from SDNY to do it, then the resignation of main [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  justice officials who had the case dumped on them and they wouldn't take it either. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=337.24s)]
*  This is just an incredible drama in terms of federal law enforcement right now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  But you are in a very unusual position, a singular position with regard to this case, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  which is that thanks to the New York state constitution and New York City law, you are [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=349.64s)]
*  the only person who has the power to effectively fire Mayor Eric Adams and remove him from [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=354.96s)]
*  this position, which might conceivably moot this whole fight. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=359.88s)]
*  How are you thinking about that now? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=365.8s)]
*  You could have done it at any point until now, but now given this crisis that's emerged [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=367.52s)]
*  in federal law enforcement around this case, are you feeling differently about that responsibility? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=371.76s)]
*  Let me tell you from a couple of angles here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=376.36s)]
*  One is that this is unbelievably unprecedented for the Department of Justice in Washington [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=378.4s)]
*  to interfere in this way. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=384.44s)]
*  My husband was a 30-year federal prosecutor. Barack Obama made him his United States attorney. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  You look at what happened here, this is not supposed to happen in our system of justice. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=392.35999999999996s)]
*  The Bondi administration in that Department of Justice is already showing they're corrupt. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=396.9s)]
*  Now set that aside. I did see the letter that was issued by the acting United States attorney. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  The allegations are extremely concerning and serious. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=409.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=412.12s)]
*  But I cannot as the governor of this state have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  like a lot of other people are saying right now. I have to do what's smart, what's right, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=418.32000000000005s)]
*  and I'm consulting with other leaders in government at this time. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=422.36s)]
*  I've got to have one sane person in this state who can cut through all the crap and say, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=425.04s)]
*  what is my responsibility? Guide me to do. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=430.68s)]
*  And just as when the allegations came out last September and the city was in chaos, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  I said, I will intercede, work with the mayor to get rid of a lot of people who are under [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=437.24s)]
*  indictment, calm it down, bring in a new police chief commissioner who's doing an [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLo0OGN6rDE&t=441.88s)]
