# How Russian propaganda went from fringey social media to Fox News
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0)
*  After a lot of online sleuthing by disinformation researchers, particularly Russian disinformation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=0.0s)]
*  researchers, The Wall Street Journal has just published this bizarre report about one of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=7.36s)]
*  the largest, most widely followed pro-Kremlin, pro-Russia, pro-Putin social media networks [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=13.08s)]
*  on earth. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=18.76s)]
*  First of all, the amazing thing that they report is that this network apparently is [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=20.68s)]
*  by an American woman who is reportedly pretending to be Russian. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=25.24s)]
*  She is pretending to have been born in eastern Ukraine. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=30.2s)]
*  She was not born in eastern Ukraine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=34.9s)]
*  She was born in New Jersey, but she's claiming to be of Russian origin when she is not. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=36.56s)]
*  She has reportedly been running this major online network supporting Russia in the war [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=42.84s)]
*  in Ukraine with accounts on Telegram and Twitter and YouTube and Spotify. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=46.96s)]
*  There's even a podcast where she apparently speaks in a kind of fake Russian accent. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=51.28s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is describing her linked social media accounts as a prominent [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=56.92s)]
*  online voice supporting Russia's war in Ukraine, describing it as among the most widely followed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=61.64s)]
*  English language social media outlets promoting Russia's views. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=67.64s)]
*  But again, it's all run by an American woman pretending to be a Russian. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=72.8s)]
*  And what the Wall Street Journal is reporting now is amazing on a few different levels. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=78.24s)]
*  You know the classified documents that were allegedly posted online on that gaming server, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=83.64s)]
*  that Discord gaming server by that 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman who's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=88.0s)]
*  now been arrested? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  Part of the mystery around that story has not just been how did a kid who looks like [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=94.28s)]
*  he's 11 years old get access to documents that secret. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=98.44s)]
*  Another part of the sort of logistical mystery of it has been the timing of it all, because [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=102.86s)]
*  this young man allegedly posted all these documents, classified documents. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=107.28s)]
*  He posted them online starting in December and January, but they didn't come to public [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=111.24s)]
*  attention until much later, until this month. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=115.72s)]
*  Well, according to the Wall Street Journal, part of the reason that happened the way it [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=119.64s)]
*  did, part of the reason these documents finally came to public attention after languishing [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=123.4s)]
*  on this gaming Discord server where nobody was noticing them, is because one particular [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=128.28s)]
*  social media account with a big following, this one social media account with a big following [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=134.32000000000002s)]
*  for being pro-Russian and pro-Putin, the one run secretly by this American woman, her Telegram [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=139.16s)]
*  account started posting these documents to their own Telegram account a couple of weeks [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=146.32000000000002s)]
*  ago on April 5th. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  So the Massachusetts Airmen have been posting them on this Discord server. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  It was this woman apparently, or at least the network she was running, that circulated [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=158.44s)]
*  them more broadly by posting them on Telegram. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=162.36s)]
*  She has a large following on Telegram by pro-Russia, pro-Putin, pro-Kremlin interests. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  Big Russian accounts started picking up these documents only after she posted them to Telegram, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=173.24s)]
*  started circulating them more widely, and then that's when the Pentagon finally noticed [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=179.0s)]
*  them and started investigating. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  In other words, the documents were basically unnoticed sitting there on obscure gaming [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=184.96s)]
*  server chat rooms. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  They didn't get noticed at all until this big pro-Putin social media account put them [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=191.46s)]
*  into circulation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  There's a bunch of things that are very interesting about this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=199.5s)]
*  I mean, one, this pro-Putin social media network, which played this key role apparently in circulating [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  these classified documents, the woman who reportedly runs that network is not only American, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  even though she claims to be Russian, but until November, according to the Wall Street [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  Journal, she was in the United States Navy stationed at Whidbey Island. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=218.18s)]
*  That seems like a problem. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=226.34s)]
*  Another point here, perhaps a bigger problem here, is that there is a Fox News channel [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=229.34s)]
*  problem associated with this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=233.78s)]
*  In this whole scandal about these classified documents being posted online, you might have [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  heard along the way that some of the documents were altered. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=241.02s)]
*  It wasn't just that this was all classified material that the public was never supposed [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=246.98s)]
*  to see. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  Part of the issue here was that some of these documents were altered from what they originally [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=253.06s)]
*  said. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, according to the Wall Street Journal, the changed documents, the doctored documents, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=259.09999999999997s)]
*  are the ones that were posted online by this woman or by the network that she was running, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=264.06s)]
*  this pro-Putin pro-Russia social media network, which put these things into wider circulation. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=268.09999999999997s)]
*  Specifically, what was changed? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=273.38s)]
*  Well, one of these documents was changed to make Russian casualties in the war look way [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=275.02s)]
*  lower than they were and to make Ukrainian casualties look way higher than they were. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=280.74s)]
*  In other words, this one document was doctored to make it look like Russia was doing way [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=286.62s)]
*  better in the war than they actually are and to make it look like Ukraine was losing really [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=290.06s)]
*  badly. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=294.98s)]
*  The way to put it is the way they put it when they discussed it on Fox News. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=297.82s)]
*  The second thing we learn from these slides is that despite direct U.S. involvement, Ukraine [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=304.02s)]
*  is in fact losing the war. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=308.98s)]
*  Seven Ukrainians are being killed for every Russian. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=311.58s)]
*  Ukraine is losing the war. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=315.42s)]
*  Ukraine is losing the war. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=317.82s)]
*  Seven Ukrainians are being killed for every Russian. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=318.9s)]
*  That's not actually what you can learn from the slides. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=322.98s)]
*  That's what you can learn from the documents that were allegedly posted online by this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=326.76s)]
*  Massachusetts Air National Guardsman who was arrested that week. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=331.84s)]
*  But then in order to get that seven Ukrainians killed for every one Russian killed, in order [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=335.52s)]
*  to get that, you can only learn that from the slides that were crudely doctored by the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=340.88s)]
*  pro-Russia, pro-Putin social media network that circulated the classified information [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=346.4s)]
*  in the first place, but only reportedly after changing the documents to try to make it look [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=350.82s)]
*  like Russia's war is going way better than it is. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=355.42s)]
*  So how did these documents get into circulation? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=360.44s)]
*  This weird pro-Russia social media network affiliated with somebody who just got out [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=362.98s)]
*  of the U.S. Navy, that is the network that also circulated the fake documents that were [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=367.94s)]
*  altered crudely to make it look like Russia is definitely winning the war and Ukraine [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=373.44s)]
*  is definitely losing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=378.5s)]
*  And that's the document that Fox News highlighted on their network last Thursday night. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFnEY2cIWd0&t=380.46s)]
