# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Oct. 16
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4)
*  Here in our national capital, the leader of the far right and the de facto leader of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=0.0s)]
*  Republican Party is of course on trial for his alleged role in trying to overturn the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=6.48s)]
*  result of the election in which he was voted out. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=11.44s)]
*  It's only one of four cases in which Donald Trump is currently facing multiple felony [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=15.32s)]
*  charges. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=20.52s)]
*  But today there was big news in his federal case in Washington. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=21.88s)]
*  Today the judge overseeing Trump's federal criminal case in D.C., the one about him trying [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=26.28s)]
*  to overthrow the lawfully elected government of the United States, that federal judge in [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=31.76s)]
*  Washington today instituted a limited version of what's generally called a gag order that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  bans him by court order from disparaging the prosecutors or potential witnesses in his [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=43.84s)]
*  or any personnel who work for the courts in which he is being tried. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=51.44s)]
*  Now in terms of the exact contours of this court order, we are still expecting the judge's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=56.4s)]
*  written order, but she did rule verbally from the bench today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=62.4s)]
*  And we got the transcript of it, which is amazing. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=68.12s)]
*  It was this all day long sort of rockum sockum, rollicking hearing today. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=71.16s)]
*  And at the very end of it, this was the judge giving part of the verbal version of the gag [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=76.48s)]
*  order, which Donald Trump will now be bound by. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  She said this, quote, I cannot imagine any other criminal case in which a defendant is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=86.68s)]
*  permitted to call a prosecutor deranged or a thug. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=90.4s)]
*  And I will not permit it here simply because the defendant is running a political campaign. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=94.88s)]
*  His presidential candidacy does not give him carte blanche to vilify and implicitly encourage [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=99.64s)]
*  violence against public servants who are simply doing their job. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=105.24s)]
*  My review of past statements made by Mr. Trump in particular, as well as the evidence that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=109.88s)]
*  they have led to harassment and threats for the people he has targeted, persuades me that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=114.28s)]
*  without this restriction, there's a real risk that witnesses may be intimidated or unduly [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=118.64s)]
*  influenced and that other potential witnesses may be reluctant to come forward lest they [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=123.8s)]
*  be subjected to the same harassment and intimidation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=128.32s)]
*  And she says this, quote, now, let me be clear. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=132.66s)]
*  Mr. Trump may still vigorously seek public support as a presidential candidate, debate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=135.38s)]
*  policies and people related to that candidacy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=140.46s)]
*  He may criticize the current administration and assert his belief that this prosecution [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=144.14s)]
*  is politically motivated. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=148.5s)]
*  But those critical First Amendment freedoms do not allow him to launch a pretrial smear [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=150.9s)]
*  campaign against participating government staff, their families and foreseeable witnesses. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  No other criminal defendant would be allowed to do so, and I am not going to allow it [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=161.26s)]
*  in this case. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  She then concludes with this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  The reasons discussed during this hearing, therefore, I find that these measures are [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=170.5s)]
*  consistent with the rights secured by the first, fifth and sixth amendments and that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=174.38s)]
*  they are both necessary and narrowly tailored to safeguard the integrity of these proceedings [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  as well as to protect the safety of the people assisting with them. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=183.66s)]
*  If any party or counsel, meaning any lawyer, any party or counsel violates these restrictions [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=186.86s)]
*  or the other laws or obligations by which they are bound, I will either upon receipt [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=193.26000000000002s)]
*  of a motion or sui sponte, meaning on my own as the judge, I will consider sanctions as [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=197.46s)]
*  may be necessary. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=204.82000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  We're adjourned. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  Bang. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  The gavel falls. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  Accountability. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  Judge Tanya Chutkin ruling from the bench today in Washington. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=213.42s)]
*  We await the written version of this order. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=218.1s)]
*  Trump already says he's going to appeal it, but as of now, he is bound by it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=221.61999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republicans appear poised to elevate Donald Trump's closest major ally in Congress [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=225.85999999999999s)]
*  to be speaker of the House, which would put Congressman Jim Jordan, among other things, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  Third in the line of succession after the president and the vice president. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=239.62s)]
*  Jim Jordan, of course, played a key role in Trump's efforts to use Congress to try to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=245.18s)]
*  overturn the election result in 2020. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=249.66s)]
*  If he does become speaker, I got to say it feels like it becomes basically an open question [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  as to whether a House of Representatives under Jim Jordan's leadership would ever certify [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=258.9s)]
*  the election results of an election in which Donald Trump ran but lost. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=264.9s)]
*  There's also news tonight, first broken on our air by Richard Engel, that Hamas is now [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  stating that it has between 200 and 250 hostages in Gaza. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=277.46s)]
*  Hamas also releasing a statement that they are looking to release some of the people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=283.29999999999995s)]
*  who they took hostage, people they describe as foreign nationals, who they say are being [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=287.58s)]
*  held not as hostages but as their guests. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=292.94s)]
*  They say they are looking to release them when field conditions permit their release. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=295.5s)]
*  We don't know what that means, but this is an important advance, at least in the story [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=301.98s)]
*  of what has become of these, again, 200, maybe more people who are being held by Hamas. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=306.14s)]
*  NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel tonight is reporting from near the Israel-Gaza [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=311.06s)]
*  border. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=315.42s)]
*  Richard, I'm happy to lay eyes on you. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=316.42s)]
*  Thanks for staying up to join us. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=318.74s)]
*  What do you make of the statement from Hamas? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  Why they're doing it? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=323.06s)]
*  What do you think it means? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=324.06s)]
*  Well, I think it's very significant, Rachel. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=328.06s)]
*  I think it means that there's movement on this issue after hearing nothing from Hamas. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  Hamas said that it is holding 200 hostages. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=336.14s)]
*  It said that other groups, however, in the Gaza Strip are holding more hostages. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=340.41999999999996s)]
*  So they're talking about Hamas with 200, the military wing of Hamas, and then another 50 [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=344.97999999999996s)]
*  or more, according to the spokesman of Hamas, inside the Gaza Strip total. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=351.06s)]
*  And among those 200 that Hamas says it is holding, it says there are an unspecified [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=357.02s)]
*  number of foreign nationals and that it is willing to hand them over, that it wants to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=363.18s)]
*  hand them over, that it doesn't believe that they are party to this conflict and that it [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=368.22s)]
*  has no issue with them and it will hand them over when the conditions are right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=374.54s)]
*  As you said, what does it mean when the conditions are right? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=380.54s)]
*  But also a few hours ago, just slightly before Hamas issued that statement, Iran's foreign [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=384.62s)]
*  minister said that Hamas is expressing a willingness to release hostages when Israel or if Israel [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=390.66s)]
*  stops its airstrikes into Gaza. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=398.38s)]
*  So we're hearing similar messages both from Iran and from Hamas about releasing hostages, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=400.74s)]
*  talking about field conditions at the same time. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=408.06s)]
*  So there is movement on this issue. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=411.09999999999997s)]
*  The issue is, however, they're only talking about those hostages who are dual nationals [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=413.74s)]
*  or foreigners. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=419.78s)]
*  And they also said that any of people who were taken, any hostages that were taken that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=421.26s)]
*  were fighting, even if they are Americans or French or they didn't mention nationalities, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=426.97999999999996s)]
*  but foreign nationals, but were serving in the Israeli military or serving in a fighting [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=431.94s)]
*  capacity, they wouldn't be considered for this arrangement. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=437.66s)]
*  They would be considered combatants and they would be treated like Israelis. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=441.62s)]
*  So it seems what Hamas is trying to do is create a division, create a wedge to say that [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=446.26000000000005s)]
*  its fight is with Israel and Israel alone and not with the United States, not with the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=452.3s)]
*  rest of the world. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=458.94000000000005s)]
*  And this comes amid a lot of international diplomacy, a lot of efforts by the United [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=460.38s)]
*  States and other countries and its allies to try and get movement on this issue and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=465.78000000000003s)]
*  to try and get those hostages out, hopefully, just as a start. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=471.18s)]
*  And Richard, I don't want to get too far ahead of the story or to imagine sort of too much [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  nitty gritty here that we can't get at. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=481.1s)]
*  But it seems to me like even if they are trying to establish some sort of divide between different [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=482.94s)]
*  types of hostages, the release of any hostages is both good for those people who could then [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=487.82s)]
*  potentially be saved, but also potentially strategically important for getting all or [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=494.38s)]
*  more or potentially all of the hostages out because presumably the people released could [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=499.9s)]
*  help in terms of finding the rest of them, couldn't they? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=504.26s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=510.82s)]
*  You take the yes. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=512.54s)]
*  If Hamas is willing to give up hostages and not asking for any specific thing in return [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=513.7s)]
*  except for potentially even just a temporary halt in the bombings, we don't know exactly [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=521.78s)]
*  what Hamas is asking for. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=528.3s)]
*  We're not party to those conversations between Hamas and different negotiators. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=530.9399999999999s)]
*  But what they're publicly asking and what Iran is also suggesting is they're talking [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=537.56s)]
*  about a stop of the airstrikes. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=541.9s)]
*  Then yes, get those people out and then see what they know, see where they were taken. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=543.86s)]
*  What is the mentality? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=550.28s)]
*  How are they being treated? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=551.78s)]
*  What do they know about the other hostages? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=552.78s)]
*  Absolutely, they could lead to more intelligence, more leads and provide tremendous relief to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=554.78s)]
*  the hostages themselves who may be injured, absolutely terrified and their families. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=561.92s)]
*  I was hostage myself in the Middle East, not by Hamas, but by another group. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=567.68s)]
*  And I can tell you the amount of stress that it puts on the people who are taken and their [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=572.64s)]
*  families. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=576.72s)]
*  Absolutely, it would be good for them and potentially good for the rest. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=578.1600000000001s)]
*  And Richard, I was interested to hear you say that you were in touch with people involved [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=581.72s)]
*  in a number of Arab countries who have been working on trying to negotiate something, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=587.4s)]
*  trying to make some contact, some progress on the hostage issue. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=591.36s)]
*  We heard from a hostage's family member today about having been contacted by people in touch [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  with the Red Cross and other nonprofit NGO groups that are trying to work on this issue. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=599.88s)]
*  Do you sense that, from what you're hearing from Israeli officials and American officials [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=607.1600000000001s)]
*  and other people in the region, do you think this is a live thing that's being worked on [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=610.82s)]
*  right now? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=615.3000000000001s)]
*  Is this something that there's, it's not just individual forays and individual statements, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=616.3000000000001s)]
*  but there's actual person-to-person negotiation happening here and that we might get movement soon? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=621.1800000000001s)]
*  Yes, there is motion on this and there are contacts that are happening and they are happening [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=630.94s)]
*  in real time. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=635.88s)]
*  That is certainly the case. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=638.62s)]
*  There is a lot of effort focused on this. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=640.26s)]
*  There is effort focused on this around the world. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=642.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't believe this statement was issued in isolation, that it was something that Hamas [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=646.26s)]
*  just threw out there. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=651.02s)]
*  This is a concerted international effort and I believe it's the result of some diplomacy. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=653.9s)]
*  Now, what will happen with it? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=658.66s)]
*  Will it come true? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=660.6999999999999s)]
*  There's so much that can go wrong here. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=662.54s)]
*  This is still an active war zone. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=664.26s)]
*  You can hear where I am right now. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=667.26s)]
*  There's the loud buzzing of Israeli drones overhead. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=669.1s)]
*  We have been hearing some continued strikes into Gaza. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=673.1600000000001s)]
*  There is an opening. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=677.38s)]
*  There is movement here, but there is no guarantee of success at this stage. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=678.58s)]
*  But to go back to your original question, was this the result of some concerted international [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=683.4200000000001s)]
*  effort? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=689.02s)]
*  I believe it was. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=690.02s)]
*  Richard Engel, Chief Foreign Correspondent for NBC News. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=691.5s)]
*  Richard, you are never allowed to be taken hostage again and you must stay safe. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=693.9799999999999s)]
*  All of us aged many decades over those days that you were gone, my friend. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=698.3s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=703.5s)]
*  Joining us now live here in studios, Congressman Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=706.3s)]
*  He is the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, which is always important, but [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=710.38s)]
*  days like this, it's crazy important. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=714.62s)]
*  Congressman, it's nice to see you. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=716.78s)]
*  Good to see you, Rachel. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=718.54s)]
*  Do you think that President Biden's personal plans to visit Israel the day after tomorrow [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=720.18s)]
*  are indicative that there has been some sort of major breakthrough that he wants to be [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=726.0999999999999s)]
*  there to take credit for? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=729.8599999999999s)]
*  Or is him going there something that will hopefully shake loose those kinds of diplomatic [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=731.7199999999999s)]
*  advances that we haven't yet seen? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=735.7399999999999s)]
*  I don't think there's anything to celebrate just yet. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=737.9799999999999s)]
*  Based on the contact I've had over the course of the last week or so at the White House [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=740.18s)]
*  and State Department and elsewhere, I think what this is largely about is just indicating [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=743.38s)]
*  his personal and the United States' commitment to keeping this war from getting regional, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=748.58s)]
*  from getting bigger. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=753.86s)]
*  Two carrier strike groups in the region, the movement of a couple of air wings, and the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=755.1800000000001s)]
*  president of the United States visiting not just Israel. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=758.7800000000001s)]
*  And by the way, if you saw his statement today, visiting Israel to support Israel, as we do, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=761.62s)]
*  but also saying there's a huge difference between Palestinians, especially innocent [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=765.64s)]
*  Palestinians, and Hamas, but also going to Jordan, also going to Egypt, that says to [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=769.48s)]
*  Iran, it says to Hezbollah, it says to terrorist elements in the West Bank, don't do it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=773.94s)]
*  And that's really critical. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=778.5s)]
*  That's really critical. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=779.5s)]
*  Absent that kind of full court press that you're describing, political, diplomatic, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=780.5s)]
*  military from the United States, do you think that we would be at real risk of a regional [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=784.86s)]
*  conflict? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=790.38s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=791.38s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=792.38s)]
*  No, and you know, it's not even close to a done deal yet, right? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=793.38s)]
*  And this is one of the reasons, apart from the moral reasons for encouraging the Israelis [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=797.1s)]
*  to be very careful, abide by the laws of armed conflict, et cetera, et cetera, apart from [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=800.62s)]
*  moral reasons, you know, Hezbollah faces politics too. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=805.78s)]
*  And if the images coming out of Gaza of a military operation were as brutal as Hamas [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=809.02s)]
*  would like them to be, you know, Hezbollah might feel like they've got no choice but [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=813.5s)]
*  to jump in. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=817.22s)]
*  And today, if that happened, it would be very, very bad. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=818.22s)]
*  Had that happened a week ago when Israel was caught on the back feet, it could have been [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=821.26s)]
*  a true crisis for the state of Israel. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=825.66s)]
*  What about our allies in the region, countries like Jordan, where the president's going to [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=827.9599999999999s)]
*  be visiting? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=831.86s)]
*  The issue of leverage and diplomatic skill when it comes to nations like Qatar trying [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=832.86s)]
*  to intervene in the hostage issue, those thorny questions that I was just discussing with [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=838.14s)]
*  Ayman about Egypt and its own interests in the Sinai Peninsula, the crossing with Gaza, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=842.1s)]
*  what it's being asked to do, what it feels like it can do. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=847.7s)]
*  What do you make of our diplomatic effort right now? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=851.34s)]
*  How much effort's being done there and what else could be done that hasn't already happened? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=853.42s)]
*  Yeah, well, apart from what we were just talking about, trying to keep it from the conflict [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=856.58s)]
*  from widening Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, these are rulers who very much worry about [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=860.46s)]
*  their own heads. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=866.86s)]
*  And right now, they're thinking, you know, our street, and this is certainly true of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=868.08s)]
*  the King of Jordan, it's true in Egypt where they have massive economic problems to begin [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=872.26s)]
*  with. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=876.14s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's a little different case. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=877.14s)]
*  They're worried about their own survival. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=878.62s)]
*  And so they, too, have an interest in this conflict not widening. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=880.3000000000001s)]
*  They also have an interest, and this is why so many of them release statements that were [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=883.4000000000001s)]
*  very aggressively, uncomfortably, shall we say, pro-Palestinian. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=887.8199999999999s)]
*  By that, I mean, no problem being pro-Palestinian, but pro-Hamas takes us to a whole other world. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=890.74s)]
*  They really worry about their own survival. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=895.02s)]
*  In terms of what the U.S. response can be, we expect that there'll be an emergency aid [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=897.54s)]
*  request for Israel. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=902.38s)]
*  Obviously, nothing goes through the United States House when there is no United States [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=903.62s)]
*  House. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=907.38s)]
*  Do you think that the Republicans are going to elect Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan, to be the [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=908.38s)]
*  Speaker of the House tomorrow? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=913.3s)]
*  It's been, for many reasons, been a difficult day, but I just never imagined we'd be at [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=915.38s)]
*  a point where we were talking about a Speaker, Jim Jordan. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=920.98s)]
*  And I'll come back to your question, but I mean, nobody, I think nobody did more to justify [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=923.58s)]
*  and to back and to paper over not just Trump's misbehavior, you know, not a good idea to [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=928.86s)]
*  tell Zelensky that you're not sending military aid unless he gives him dirt on the Bidens, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=935.12s)]
*  right? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=939.58s)]
*  But also after January 6th, I mean, you know, he refused a congressional subpoena of a commission [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=940.58s)]
*  that was trying to figure out how big the plan was to stop the peaceful transfer of [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=945.18s)]
*  power. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=949.98s)]
*  And Jim Jordan was right in the mix of that. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=950.98s)]
*  Back to your question, the White House is, I think, at least when I heard a couple of [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=953.5s)]
*  days ago, they are going to submit a package to the Congress that will involve both Ukraine [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=957.18s)]
*  aid and aid for Israel. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=961.6999999999999s)]
*  That's going to make an awful lot of Republicans pretty angry. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=964.1999999999999s)]
*  But I know that my party and the Senate, both sides of the aisle, care a lot about doing [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=966.48s)]
*  both. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=971.9s)]
*  And so I think you're going to see that from the White House to the Senate. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=973.06s)]
*  And then, you know, if we just happen to stumble upon a speaker of the House, maybe we take [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=975.14s)]
*  it up to. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=978.86s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=979.86s)]
*  I can't believe this is like this is the hand we have to play at this exact moment. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=980.86s)]
*  Had to be now, right? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=985.8199999999999s)]
*  Congressman Jim Himes is a Democrat of Connecticut. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=986.8199999999999s)]
*  He is the ranking member, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=989.1s)]
*  It's always good to have you here. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=992.54s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=993.54s)]
*  You might have seen, you might not have seen some big news in politics in Europe. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=996.14s)]
*  A country that had been flirting with the prospect of maybe giving up their democracy, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1002.86s)]
*  maybe heading toward a more authoritarian form of government, something more like Hungary [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1007.9399999999999s)]
*  or even Russia, has decided not to go that way. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1012.26s)]
*  In Poland this weekend, the Polish people turned out in huge, huge numbers. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1016.98s)]
*  Over 74 percent voter turnout in Poland. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1022.8199999999999s)]
*  That's bigger turnout than what was previously their most important election ever when they [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1025.74s)]
*  voted out the Communist Party in 1989. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1029.9s)]
*  Polish people turned out this weekend in unprecedentedly gigantic numbers and they voted out the hard [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1033.7s)]
*  right party that had been the governing party there, the so-called law and justice party. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1042.14s)]
*  And so it's just, I mean, whether or not you care about Poland itself and its future, it's [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1048.52s)]
*  an important thing for Europe. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1054.1s)]
*  It's an important thing particularly for, say, the European Union's support of Ukraine [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1055.6599999999999s)]
*  and Russia's war on Ukraine. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1061.74s)]
*  But it also helps us get our arms around this larger international project that even we [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1064.5s)]
*  in our country are subject to right now, right? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1070.78s)]
*  We have seen authoritarian anti-democratic movements and leaders rise all over the world [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1073.7s)]
*  in recent years, including here at home. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1080.02s)]
*  But there has been electoral pushback, some notable electoral pushback in important countries. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1084.82s)]
*  We have seen, for example, Donald Trump voted out of office in this country resoundingly [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1090.26s)]
*  in the United States 2020. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1096.3799999999999s)]
*  We saw Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil voted out of power resoundingly in 2022. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1098.54s)]
*  Earlier this year in Spain, we saw the hard right party there rejected unexpectedly by [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1104.3799999999999s)]
*  voters. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1110.3s)]
*  And now this weekend, we have just seen Poland's very hard right law and justice party voted out. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1112.1399999999999s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that there isn't still rising authoritarianism all around the world, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1120.4599999999998s)]
*  but it does mean that in instances like these, in big important countries with mature democracies, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1124.62s)]
*  we are seeing big voter pushback against Trump type or Viktor Orban type leaders. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1131.38s)]
*  And authoritarians or would be authoritarians, they don't generally take well to elections [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1137.66s)]
*  voting them out of office. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1143.22s)]
*  That's part of why they try to undermine democracy full stop. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1144.5800000000002s)]
*  In the case of both Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, we saw mass violence after they [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1148.5800000000002s)]
*  were voted out. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1153.6200000000001s)]
*  We saw their supporters storming the Capitol to try to keep them in power after they lost [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1154.6200000000001s)]
*  election. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1159.2600000000002s)]
*  And so eyes are on Poland now for any kind of potential eventuality like that or any [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1160.98s)]
*  other kind of, you know, authoritarian rule by force shenanigans to try to undo the Polish [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1165.9s)]
*  election result from this weekend. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1171.78s)]
*  But for now, that is an important result in Europe. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1174.22s)]
*  It looks like another win for small D Democrats against the admittedly still rising authoritarian [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1177.06s)]
*  tide. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdN5I7L9sT4&t=1185.1s)]
