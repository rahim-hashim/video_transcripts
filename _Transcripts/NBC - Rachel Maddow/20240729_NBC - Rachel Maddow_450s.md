# Biden offers reform ideas to fix broken, politicized Supreme Court
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ)
*  President Biden had already said that he wants to spend his remaining months in office working [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  on bold reform to the United States Supreme Court. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Today, he finally spelled out what that means. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=8.6s)]
*  He called for three specific changes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=10.44s)]
*  One, fix the damage done by the recent court decision that said presidents are free to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=12.56s)]
*  commit crimes without fear of prosecution. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  He says that should be undone the only way you can undo something like that, which is [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=20.52s)]
*  with a constitutional amendment. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=24.76s)]
*  Number two, he said there should be term limits for Supreme Court justices. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=26.88s)]
*  They shouldn't serve for life anymore. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  He said there should be 18-year terms. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=32.56s)]
*  He said that would have the effect of stopping any single president from reshaping the bench [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=35.24s)]
*  for a generation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=40.7s)]
*  And third, he said we should institute a binding code of conduct, an ethics code, so justices [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=42.6s)]
*  would at least need to report things like the lavish vacations they have quietly been [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=48.28s)]
*  accepting from rich people who have an interest in the cases that are before the court. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=52.72s)]
*  That today was President Biden's very specific three-part pitch for trying to restore public [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=58.16s)]
*  trust in the Supreme Court. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=63.44s)]
*  Now, at least one justice, Justice Elena Kagan, has already said yes to part of that in concept, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=65.0s)]
*  saying there does need to be an enforceable code of ethics. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  Justices should no longer be allowed to just police themselves, since clearly that is not [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=74.24s)]
*  working. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=78.4s)]
*  So there's that to start. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=79.68s)]
*  Writing today at Slate.com, the civil rights attorney and legal scholar Sherilyn Ifill [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=82.36s)]
*  underlined the urgency of this moment. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=86.28s)]
*  She said, quote, in just the last three terms alone, this court has upended long-standing [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=89.04s)]
*  precedents, fundamentally changing the allocation of power between the branches of government, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=93.56s)]
*  wiping away rights it formerly deemed fundamental, and upending the protections and guarantees [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=98.48s)]
*  upon which tens of millions of Americans had come to rely for decades. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=103.92s)]
*  Joining us now is Sherilyn Ifill. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=109.04s)]
*  She's the Vernon E. Jordan Jr. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=110.6s)]
*  Endowed Chair in Civil Rights at Howard University Law School and one of my favorite people to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=111.96s)]
*  talk to about anything, but especially the Supreme Court. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=116.52s)]
*  Sherilyn, it's really nice to see you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=120.2s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=121.6s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=124.0s)]
*  You have been an advocate for a long time that the court needs discipline, effectively, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=125.32s)]
*  that the court needs reform, that it has behaved in such a way in recent years that rightfully [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=131.12s)]
*  call its legitimacy into question and to the public in a way that's dangerous, given [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=136.24s)]
*  the important role of the court in our society and in our system of government. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=142.52s)]
*  What do you assess as the sort of the weight, the heft, the potential to meet the moment [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=147.16s)]
*  of these reforms proposed today by President Biden? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=152.36s)]
*  Well, it's going to be a very steep climb. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, this is not something that can be done by presidential fiat or by executive [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  order. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=164.84s)]
*  It's going to require Congress to pass legislation, and that means that obviously this will not [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=166.44s)]
*  happen with this Congress, but if the next Congress is to take it up, it would likely [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=171.16s)]
*  mean you would have to have a majority of Democrats in both the House and the Senate. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=175.36s)]
*  And that's why talking about this election, it's important to not just talk about the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=179.72s)]
*  president if you want Supreme Court reform. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=182.88s)]
*  But it's also a heavy lift, because look, Rachel, it's difficult. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=185.56s)]
*  It's difficult for me as a litigator to talk about these kinds of reforms and the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=188.12s)]
*  need for them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=194.44s)]
*  But as a civil rights lawyer, as someone who believes in democracy and as someone who understands [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=196.0s)]
*  the power of this court, not only to hold the line and the rule of law, but also to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  get us off the track of healthy democracy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=206.4s)]
*  The court has done it in the past, and I think we have to take very, very seriously what [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=209.76s)]
*  this court is doing, the track that it's on and what it could potentially do to our country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  It is my sense that the effort around the Trump-Vance candidacy in the Republican Party [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=219.68s)]
*  is in part about trying to get them votes, but it is in a significant part about trying [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  to get the election to be contested in some technical way so that it ends up in the courts [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=233.72s)]
*  for some reason or another, because I believe Republicans think as long as it gets into [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=240.32s)]
*  it gets ultimately to the Supreme Court, and no matter what is before the Supreme Court, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  they would do whatever was necessary to put Donald Trump back in the White House. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=250.55999999999997s)]
*  I say that as a non-lawyer and just an observer of the political processes here and what [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=254.76s)]
*  Republicans have been working on in the lead-up to this election. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=258.76s)]
*  Can I ask if you share those concerns? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  If you had asked me this question a year ago, I might have hesitated, but after the Supreme [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=266.52s)]
*  Court's decision in the Fourteenth Amendment Section 3 case, in which the court essentially [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=271.52s)]
*  read out of the Fourteenth Amendment the provision that says insurrectionists cannot serve by [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=277.6s)]
*  coming up with this idea that Congress needs to pass some legislation to make that provision [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=282.48s)]
*  of the Fourteenth Amendment effective. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=287.6s)]
*  The court's decision in the charges brought by the Justice Department against many of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=289.8s)]
*  the January 6 rioters, and then of course finally the Trump immunity case, the presidential [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=295.28s)]
*  immunity case, which is absolutely mystifying, unless you believe what the dissenters, I [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  think, the three women appointed by Democrats have been trying to tell us. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=307.52s)]
*  And their dissents have grown ever more strident and strong as they have tried to warn us that [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=312.8s)]
*  this court essentially is behaving as though it is in the tank for Trump. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=319.52s)]
*  It does not matter to me whether they are in fact in the tank for Trump. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=323.68s)]
*  That is how they are behaving. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=327.04s)]
*  And they are making leaps and bounds. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=328.8s)]
*  This is the part that it's hard, I think, for non-lawyers to understand, is how the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=330.48s)]
*  court is violating the rules of litigation, the way we bring cases before the court, who [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=334.72s)]
*  we say can bring cases before the court, how those decisions are made, what kinds of questions [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=340.3s)]
*  are raised by a piece of litigation. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=345.92s)]
*  The court is making fast and loose with those rules that govern how people like me litigate [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  in the court. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  And so they are so recklessly determined to get to the outcome that they want in these [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=354.20000000000005s)]
*  cases, not just the Trump case, but the abortion case, the affirmative action case, that they [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  are running roughshod over the rules that we play by. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's what makes a legal system fair, is if we all have to abide by the same rules. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=367.48s)]
*  And once you don't have the same rules of the game, you no longer have a legal system [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  of integrity. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  And so I think at this point, we have to recognize what is in front of us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=378.8s)]
*  We may not want to, but we have to. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=383.32s)]
*  And I'm gratified that President Biden, this has been a long road for him as well, at least [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=385.68s)]
*  has clearly put this issue before the American people. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=391.18s)]
*  And Vice President Harris has endorsed it as well. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  And we have to grapple with our reticence and our discomfort and confront the fact that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=397.82s)]
*  this also can be a threat to our democracy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  It's not just Donald Trump. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  It is also a court that does not see itself bound by any rules and that appears to have [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=406.68s)]
*  an agenda. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  Sherrilyn Ifill, endowed civil rights chair at Howard University Law School, thank you [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  for this. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=419.12s)]
*  That is both hard to hear and it strikes me as profoundly true. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=420.12s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=424.68s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=425.68s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=426.68s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=427.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA166JDrFrQ&t=436.68s)]
