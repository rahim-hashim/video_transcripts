# In defense of boringness: Weissmann on the value of due process that Trump is to face next
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ)
*  Andrew, what a day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for making time to be here tonight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=1.96s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=4.16s)]
*  Did it make your hair stand up the wrong way, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=7.28s)]
*  or did it irk you otherwise when I said that this [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=11.28s)]
*  is likely to be boring? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=14.84s)]
*  I believe that these charges, what we expect them to be, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=17.32s)]
*  and what we have seen of other charges, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=22.32s)]
*  even brought against Donald Trump in Manhattan criminal [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=23.8s)]
*  court, I feel like we ought to let people know that this might [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=26.84s)]
*  be something that is sort of like watching paint dry, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=29.88s)]
*  that this might be a little boring. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=32.04s)]
*  As a prosecutor who's bought plenty of white collar cases, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  does that bother you? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=38.28s)]
*  Did I offend you? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=39.32s)]
*  You certainly didn't offend me, Rachel. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  I think there are a couple of points. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=45.28s)]
*  One, no matter how much one anticipates a day like this, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  when it actually happens, there is, I think, for anybody, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  there is a certain amount that it sinks in what this means. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=57.12s)]
*  I totally agree with you that a former president is not immune [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=61.56s)]
*  and can be subject to charges. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=66.0s)]
*  But it is the case that this has never happened before. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=67.48s)]
*  But to your point about this now being boring, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=71.0s)]
*  I think this goes to something you were saying. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  It's sort of the flip side of that we shouldn't be thinking [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=75.8s)]
*  of a former president differently. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=80.24s)]
*  And because of that, the boring aspect [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=81.96s)]
*  that is about to happen, which is this enormous time delay [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=85.04s)]
*  between an indictment and a trial, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=88.72s)]
*  is actually part of the rule of law. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=91.44s)]
*  So for all of those people who've been waiting anxiously [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=94.32s)]
*  to see the former president held to account criminally [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=97.4s)]
*  for his conduct, part of that means [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  that you have to be patient because the rule of law [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=104.16s)]
*  that brought us to today requires that any defendant, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=106.88s)]
*  no matter whether you like them or don't like them, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=111.16s)]
*  is entitled to time to prepare, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=114.12s)]
*  to get the evidence from the government, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=116.84s)]
*  to think about what kind of defense they want to mount, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=120.68s)]
*  to make motions challenging the charges. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=124.12s)]
*  All of that is part of the rule of law. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=128.16s)]
*  And people are entitled to that no matter [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=130.4s)]
*  if it's a small crime, whether it's John Gotti. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=133.6s)]
*  Everyone is entitled to that process. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=136.44s)]
*  And it's a long process. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=138.28s)]
*  Just take one data point. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=139.52s)]
*  The Trump organization that you referred to, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=141.24s)]
*  it took 16 months for that to go from indictment to trial. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=143.8s)]
*  So it is a long process, but that process [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  is what it means to be part of the American criminal justice [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=152.52s)]
*  system. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  And I think from the point of view of your perspective, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  having been a prosecutor, having been inside that process, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=160.44s)]
*  presenting that as time to prepare, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=163.68s)]
*  time to properly litigate the motions and things [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=166.44s)]
*  about the venue and jurisdiction and what evidence is invisible [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  and all those things, that all completely makes sense. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=172.76s)]
*  I will also say just as an observer, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=175.16s)]
*  it seems to me that it's not in the letter of the law, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  but a part of the spirit of due process [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=180.48s)]
*  is also that the law be administered [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=183.0s)]
*  in a way that is dispassionate, that is not in a hurry, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=184.6s)]
*  that is not unduly delayed, but that is also not [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=188.84s)]
*  something that is meted out in the heat of the moment [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  or carried along in terms of public sentiment [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=194.84s)]
*  and a sense of drama. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=197.2s)]
*  And the delay that you're talking [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=200.16s)]
*  about that we saw in the Trump Organization trial, which [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=202.4s)]
*  is proper, the delay that you can expect in most trials that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=205.16s)]
*  are like this, because that's what it takes to do it properly, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=208.04s)]
*  also has the effect, I think, for everybody who's watching [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  that trial, however closely they're watching it, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  for whatever reasons, whatever strong feelings they [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=216.4s)]
*  have for or against the defendant or the prosecution, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  that time is sort of a cooling saucer here [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=222.24s)]
*  in terms of making sure that people aren't dragging [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=227.56s)]
*  their emotions into this. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=229.76s)]
*  And I feel the reason that I'm highlighting that I think [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=231.32s)]
*  this is going to be boring is because I think that's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=235.12s)]
*  good news for the country, that this isn't something [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=237.04s)]
*  that we're not going to side this on a run. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=239.6s)]
*  This is now something that's going [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=241.88s)]
*  to be done dispassionately, coldly, and by the book. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=243.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  And the argument is, this is from the Trump team, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=248.32s)]
*  is that this is selective prosecution, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=253.48s)]
*  that Allen Bragg acted politically. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=255.84s)]
*  And it's really important to see that he [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=258.08s)]
*  is treated like everyone else. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=260.64s)]
*  Remember, this is a DA who initially said no to the charges. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=262.56s)]
*  They're not ready. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=267.08s)]
*  That's a sign of certainly not having selective prosecution, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=268.76s)]
*  that he thought that we're not going [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  to bring a case until it's absolutely ready. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=274.32s)]
*  And we're treating him just like we would anyone else, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=276.52s)]
*  as you mentioned, with charges that are routinely [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=279.12s)]
*  brought in New York. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=281.56s)]
*  So you're not treating a former president [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=283.0s)]
*  with more weight than anyone else or less weight, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=286.24s)]
*  just like everyone else. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=290.68s)]
*  And that means that this process is [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=291.84s)]
*  going to be one where there isn't a show trial or a kangaroo [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=294.68s)]
*  court, where it's really important for Americans to see [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=299.48s)]
*  and for the world to see that the rule of law here [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=303.36s)]
*  can work in a way that I think for many people, including [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=307.04s)]
*  myself, I think many people were giving up hope [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=310.32s)]
*  that there would be accountability. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=314.12s)]
*  And then that process plays out. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=315.88s)]
*  And if Donald Trump can win in the sense [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=318.0s)]
*  that the government has not proved its case beyond [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=321.56s)]
*  a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=323.88s)]
*  that is the way the system is supposed to work. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=326.52s)]
*  That is the rule of law at play. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=328.67999999999995s)]
*  And we have to have faith in the same system that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=330.88s)]
*  led to today in watching this go forward. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dGTpLJJuwQ&t=333.55999999999995s)]
