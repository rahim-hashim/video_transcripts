# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 25
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 26, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0)
*  It has been a tough day all around on the Trump Republican side of the ledger, though. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=0.0s)]
*  Late on Friday night, you'll recall we got that lengthy filing from the January 6th investigation [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=5.84s)]
*  disclosing all sorts of information we didn't previously have about members of Congress [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  and the administration and how they tried to throw out the election results to keep [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=15.0s)]
*  Trump in power after he lost reelection. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=18.48s)]
*  That filing from late on Friday night, two or 300 page long filing, that's been bolstered [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=21.8s)]
*  by a trove of more than 2,000 text messages to and from Trump White House Chief of Staff [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=27.82s)]
*  Mark Meadows, text messages that were obtained by CNN and published by CNN in part today. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=32.58s)]
*  Taken together, that filing on Friday night from the January 6th investigators and these [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=39.66s)]
*  text messages disclosed today in the press, those two disclosures paint a sort of new [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=43.68s)]
*  and unnerving picture of how involved members of Congress and members of the administration [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=50.34s)]
*  were in trying to use not only perceived legal tools, legal maneuvers, political tactics, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=55.82s)]
*  but also the threat of mob violence to keep Trump in power. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=64.62s)]
*  I mean, first, for example, we learned from testimony to the investigation by an aide [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=68.7s)]
*  to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that Meadows was told in no uncertain terms [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=74.3s)]
*  by the White House Counsel's Office that this scheme they tried to have Republican controlled [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=79.22s)]
*  states send fake Trump electors to be counted in the Electoral College. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=84.0s)]
*  Mark Meadows was told by the White House Counsel's Office that that scheme was illegal. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=89.84s)]
*  We then learn from testimony to the investigation that there was an attempted workaround for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=95.52s)]
*  that little problem of it being illegal. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=100.84s)]
*  We've previously discussed and you've previously heard the reporting that Trump mold and attempted [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=103.92s)]
*  to proverbially decapitate the Department of Justice to remove its existing leadership [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=110.04s)]
*  and instead put in place at the top of the department this man, a man named Jeff Clark. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=115.12s)]
*  You might also remember that he took the Fifth Amendment. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  He asserted his Fifth Amendment rights to avoid incriminating himself dozens of times [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=122.92s)]
*  during his own testimony to the January 6th investigation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=127.84s)]
*  Well, why did Trump want to put Jeff Clark in front of the Justice Department, on the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  top of the Justice Department? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=135.52s)]
*  Why did he want to take out the existing leadership and instead put this guy in there? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=136.72s)]
*  Well, what we have newly learned from these new disclosures is that one of the things [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=140.8s)]
*  Jeff Clark thought the Justice Department should do, what he thought they could do, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=144.96s)]
*  is that the Justice Department should issue a legal memo, a legal opinion stating that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=149.16s)]
*  actually the fake electors plan was legal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=154.64s)]
*  And Mike Pence had every opportunity and every legal right to only count electors he wanted. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=159.32s)]
*  And to send others back to the states. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=167.24s)]
*  Or indeed, to consider the illegal fake electors' slates. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=169.44s)]
*  If the Justice Department issued a legal memorandum stating that that was all kosher, presumably [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=173.36s)]
*  Trump thought that would solve the problem. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=178.8s)]
*  And that's why Trump tried to install Jeff Clark as the new Attorney General, so that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  the Justice Department could do stuff like that to declare the coup to be legal. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=184.24s)]
*  We also learn from these new disclosures that multiple members of Congress participated [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  in a call with the White House Chief of Staff before January 6th, in which they discussed [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=195.96s)]
*  getting the crowd from the Trump rally to go march directly on the U.S. Capitol. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, if you're not familiar with the geography of D.C., and I actually had to look at this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=206.32s)]
*  today to remind myself about this, the ellipse, which is where Trump held the rally, and the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=210.36s)]
*  Capitol building where Congress is, they're not next to each other. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  They're two miles apart from one another. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  So an event at the ellipse would not organically end in the crowd at the ellipse, traipsing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=223.16s)]
*  two miles to go to the Capitol building in a different part of D.C. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=229.22s)]
*  We know this in part from experience. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=235.28s)]
*  There were previous Trump rallies protesting the election results in November and in December [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  in D.C. and they were big and wild and in some cases they had violence at them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  But those did not end with people marching on the Capitol. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=248.84s)]
*  There isn't anything about a march about the election results in Washington that organically [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=252.46s)]
*  and inevitably results in the crowd surging at the U.S. Capitol building, especially if [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=258.34000000000003s)]
*  it starts at the ellipse on a cold day. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=265.3s)]
*  But apparently it was no accident that the crowd on January 6th marched the two miles [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  from the ellipse to the Capitol building. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=272.7s)]
*  It was not an unplanned ad-lib by the president that day in his speech at the ellipse when [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=275.94s)]
*  he told the crowd that they should go to the Capitol. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=280.38s)]
*  Mark Meadows claimed in his memoir that that was a real surprise when Trump ad-libbed that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=282.68s)]
*  remark because nobody had said anything about that crowd going to the Capitol. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=286.72s)]
*  Well now we know that Meadows participated in at least one meeting with multiple Republican [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=290.78000000000003s)]
*  members of Congress planning for exactly that, planning for the mob at the Trump rally to [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=296.76s)]
*  be steered directly at the Capitol while the vote counting was happening inside that building. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=302.74s)]
*  Also, on Friday we saw pro-Trump Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene say in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=310.82s)]
*  court in a proceeding where her eligibility to run for reelection was being challenged [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  legally. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=320.3s)]
*  We saw her say in court that she could not recall ever suggesting to President Trump [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=321.3s)]
*  that he might declare martial law as a way of staying in power. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=325.38s)]
*  Well today we learned in fact that she did suggest that to the White House Chief of Staff, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=328.90000000000003s)]
*  Mark Meadows, and she did it in writing, in a text message. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=333.38s)]
*  And as funny and sad as it is to see her misspell martial law as martial law, like [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=336.66s)]
*  it's that story you sometimes confuse with TJ Maxx or Ross Dress for Less, as ridiculous [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=342.02000000000004s)]
*  as this all is, it is chilling to look at the date on that text message. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=346.66s)]
*  She wasn't suggesting that Trump declare martial law in the heat of the election results coming [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=354.14000000000004s)]
*  in and it looking like he might not. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=360.82000000000005s)]
*  It wasn't even in the lead up to the January 6th counting of the electoral votes before [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=363.5s)]
*  we knew there was going to be a physical attack on the Congress, right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=369.02s)]
*  We now know Republican members of Congress were scheming with the White House directly [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=373.9s)]
*  about directing the mob to leave the rally site on January 6th and march on Congress [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=377.3s)]
*  while the vote count was underway. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=381.38s)]
*  She wasn't considering and advising the White House that the President should declare martial [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=382.9s)]
*  law in the heat of that craziness. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=386.82s)]
*  No, look at the date. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=389.5s)]
*  She sent her misspelled martial law suggestion January 17th. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=392.22s)]
*  That's a week and a half after the January 6th attack. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=397.90000000000003s)]
*  After the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol to try to keep Trump in power, a week and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=402.86s)]
*  a half later, she was advising the White House that maybe martial law was going to be what [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=407.1s)]
*  it took. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=411.02000000000004s)]
*  She was suggesting that three days before the inauguration of President Biden and Vice [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=412.02000000000004s)]
*  President Harris, suggesting martial law is the way that Trump should save the Republic [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=416.42s)]
*  and stay in power. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=421.46000000000004s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=425.42s)]
*  It's also, it makes it not hard to understand because I think I understand it, but it makes [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  it a remarkable thing that the January 6th investigation apparently isn't going to be [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=435.26s)]
*  able to take any testimony from serving Republican members of Congress in their investigation. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  We've known that that was unlikely when Republican members of Congress started saying no to requests [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=445.74s)]
*  to testify voluntarily. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=450.66s)]
*  But now that we know how many of them were up to their necks in this thing, including [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=452.54s)]
*  being involved in the discussions about getting the mob physically to the Capitol building, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=456.74s)]
*  it is somewhat amazing that none of them are going to find themselves under oath answering [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=461.66s)]
*  questions about what they did. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=465.98s)]
*  Joining us now is Ben Collins. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=469.78000000000003s)]
*  He's a reporter who covers disinformation, extremism and the Internet for NBC News. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  Ben, thank you very much for being here. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=474.58000000000004s)]
*  It's nice to see you. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=476.14000000000004s)]
*  Your beat is disinformation and extremism online. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=480.1s)]
*  Is your beat going to get worse or better now? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  It depends on what Elon Musk decides to do with this service. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=489.1s)]
*  Now, he's said a couple of things. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=491.54s)]
*  He's taken a lot of populist positions on some user features, for example, the edit [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=493.70000000000005s)]
*  button, the much-fabled edit button that was going to come to Twitter. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=497.70000000000005s)]
*  He says that's going to happen. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=503.46000000000004s)]
*  That could be positive or negative. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=505.02000000000004s)]
*  We don't know what that looks like in practice. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=506.02000000000004s)]
*  But he's also said a lot of things about free speech, and that's great. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=508.22s)]
*  Free speech is the fundamental principle of this country. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=511.66s)]
*  But moderation is different than free speech. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=515.72s)]
*  And moderation is hard. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=518.7s)]
*  It's extremely hard. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=521.22s)]
*  In fact, it's an art, it's not a science, it's an unwinnable game. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=522.22s)]
*  And he just got the worst job in the world. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=527.34s)]
*  He is now the king of content moderation on the world's fastest moving news platform. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=529.1s)]
*  If he thought this was going to be fun, I don't know what's going on in his head because [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=534.52s)]
*  this is just going to be a world of hurt. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=537.38s)]
*  I feel like, Ben, one of the things that we've seen when other people have not taken over [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=540.46s)]
*  big media companies but started their own niche media companies on this issue of free [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=546.14s)]
*  speech and not doing content moderation and it being a wide open Wild West, and that's [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=551.16s)]
*  the point of it, is that pretty quickly we get lots of ISIS beheading videos and, you [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=555.9399999999999s)]
*  pornography and eating disorder, dysmorphia photos and other things that in some cases [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=563.02s)]
*  are illegal and in other cases make the site, make the use of the site impossible for normal [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=570.9s)]
*  humans with normal gag reflexes. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=580.06s)]
*  Is that, A, is that fair? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=584.46s)]
*  And B, how does Mr. Musk contend with that? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=586.66s)]
*  How would a Mr. Musk contend with that kind of previous experience when other people have [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=592.74s)]
*  taken on the same task? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=597.66s)]
*  Yeah, look, that's incredibly fair from both sides of this, from both sides of the spectrum [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=599.9s)]
*  here, from the extremist forum side and from the civilian internet side. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=606.9399999999999s)]
*  So on the civilian internet side, you have stuff like TikTok and Twitter and Facebook. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=610.6999999999999s)]
*  Here's a content moderation challenge from TikTok from a few weeks ago. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=614.0200000000001s)]
*  A few weeks ago, a girl on TikTok was trying to make slime, you know, the stuff that like [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=617.1s)]
*  12 year olds make play with. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=620.74s)]
*  She was trying to make slime and she made Maypalm by mistake. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=622.94s)]
*  Now is that free speech? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=626.46s)]
*  Should you leave that up? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=628.94s)]
*  TikTok took that down. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=629.94s)]
*  They found it and they were like, this is very dangerous, really bad. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=630.94s)]
*  Should take this down. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=634.26s)]
*  You shouldn't be teaching kids how to make Maypalm. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=635.26s)]
*  That's an issue. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=637.26s)]
*  I would bet Elon Musk's Twitter is going to take that down. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=639.3000000000001s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=643.02s)]
*  I'm not really sure here what falls into that space, especially now that he's taking the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=644.02s)]
*  company private. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=647.74s)]
*  Oversight for this sort of thing will be very different. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=649.6999999999999s)]
*  And I will say, by the way, Rachel, everybody has a line. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=651.6999999999999s)]
*  4chan, for example, everyone thinks that 4chan is the worst site on the internet and it was [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=656.3s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=661.38s)]
*  But they had a line. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=663.5s)]
*  They had a direct line. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=665.5s)]
*  And that line to them was anime depictions of child pornography. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=667.9399999999999s)]
*  And they started taking that down. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=672.78s)]
*  This was a few years ago. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=673.78s)]
*  And that's how we got 8chan. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=674.78s)]
*  8chan said, we are going to create a space where literally everything is allowed. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=676.78s)]
*  If you want to do those anime depictions of child pornography, it's allowed on 8chan. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=684.18s)]
*  That was their line. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=690.4599999999999s)]
*  And 8chan became a place where people dropped manifestos before they did mass shootings. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=691.4599999999999s)]
*  It's where Q from QAnon came from. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=695.42s)]
*  It became a full-on extremist website. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=697.26s)]
*  That's the place without the line. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=699.86s)]
*  They ended up closing down effectively. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=701.0600000000001s)]
*  And their owner, the guy who started that, had a come to Jesus moment. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=702.62s)]
*  He changed his mind about the entire idea of this. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=705.94s)]
*  His name is Fred Brennan. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=708.62s)]
*  And he is a person who has fought for years now to take down 8chan. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=709.98s)]
*  So everybody who thinks that they want complete unfettered free speech on the internet, they [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=714.9s)]
*  meet their line eventually. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=721.98s)]
*  Ben, one last question for you. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=723.98s)]
*  In business terms, is there anything that we know about the terms of this deal that [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=726.22s)]
*  would restrict Elon Musk from any particular kinds of changes? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=730.38s)]
*  Or once he owns it and it's his private entity, can he do literally anything he wants? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=735.22s)]
*  We don't fully know that yet, but it is his private entity. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=741.82s)]
*  There are a lot of people at this company who are afraid. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=746.06s)]
*  I've talked to people inside the company in the last few days, and they are afraid, not [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=747.9s)]
*  just for their jobs, but for the product they built and the town square they built. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=751.54s)]
*  They put a lot of work into this thing. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=756.46s)]
*  And they are afraid of what's going to happen to a guy who has never done content moderation [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=758.4599999999999s)]
*  before taking over this platform. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=761.4599999999999s)]
*  Ben Collins, reporter covering disinformation, extremism and the internet for NBC News. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=764.9799999999999s)]
*  Just an invaluable resource in our company. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=769.42s)]
*  Ben, I'm grateful for you. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=772.26s)]
*  Every single time you post anything or write anything for this company, your reporting [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=773.6999999999999s)]
*  is about to get even more important in days ahead. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=777.9799999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here tonight. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=780.18s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=782.78s)]
*  The Biden infrastructure bill allocated $7.5 billion to build electric vehicle charging [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=784.56s)]
*  stations all around the country. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=790.56s)]
*  They have just started spending that money from the bipartisan infrastructure bill. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=791.88s)]
*  And $7.5 billion on that, $7.5 billion on new charging stations, should make a noticeable [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=796.4s)]
*  difference. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=802.8399999999999s)]
*  It should make electric vehicles the smarter choice for millions of Americans. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=803.8399999999999s)]
*  That will really help. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=809.06s)]
*  But this, I mean, all this to say, it's sort of really finally happening. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=811.24s)]
*  When it comes to trying to get America to transition away from gas-powered vehicles, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=814.8s)]
*  we know what Ford is up to with the largest selling vehicle in America. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=820.64s)]
*  That's going to be a big day for that tomorrow. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=823.68s)]
*  We know what the Biden administration is up to with those infrastructure dollars already [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=825.5799999999999s)]
*  starting to flow. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=829.38s)]
*  But what about the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=830.38s)]
*  What are they up to right now? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=835.84s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=837.64s)]
*  Their eccentric CEO is shelling out an ungodly amount of money to buy a social media website. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=839.6s)]
*  That seems like a great use of $44 billion. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=847.32s)]
*  Tesla CEO, world's richest man, Elon Musk, has reportedly inked a deal to purchase the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=851.8000000000001s)]
*  social media company Twitter. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=857.48s)]
*  He's going to spend $44 billion to do it, and then he will own it privately. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=859.48s)]
*  I know that when people start throwing around big numbers, like numbers with three commas [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=865.32s)]
*  in them, it can be hard to keep track of what any of it really means. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=869.16s)]
*  But just consider this just in this context. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=871.48s)]
*  I mentioned the bipartisan infrastructure bill allocated $7.5 billion for EV charging [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=875.04s)]
*  stations for the entire country. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=881.04s)]
*  Elon Musk is spending nearly six times that amount to buy a website where people can write [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=883.68s)]
*  stuff in 280 characters. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=889.6s)]
*  Elon Musk buying Twitter says a lot about the priorities of people at the highest levels [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=894.0400000000001s)]
*  making decisions that could affect the fate of the planet. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=899.12s)]
*  But of course, it also raises a lot of questions about what will happen to what is perhaps [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=903.24s)]
*  the most influential social media company in the world at a time when authoritarians, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=906.84s)]
*  insurrectionists, and rogue petrostates are weaponizing disinformation online in a way [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=911.2800000000001s)]
*  they've never done so before. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=915.7800000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk says he is buying Twitter to save free speech online. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=918.24s)]
*  And what he means by that is he wants to push back on efforts to moderate content on these websites. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=924.0s)]
*  Why do these websites moderate content? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=929.0s)]
*  And what does he want to do instead? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=931.0s)]
*  What will it mean for our society and our democracy that one of the biggest social media [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=933.4s)]
*  companies in the world will only be accountable to that one guy and what he considers free speech? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=936.48s)]
*  Do you think it is significant that we're learning again from these recent disclosures [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=943.48s)]
*  that there does seem to have been an active effort, a planned effort, not a spontaneous surprise, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=950.0s)]
*  that it wasn't a spontaneous surprise, that the crowd that Trump had rallied at the ellipse [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=955.0s)]
*  moved to the U.S. Capitol? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=959.8s)]
*  Obviously, we'd heard Trump call for that during his speech that was portrayed as an [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=961.28s)]
*  ad-libbed moment, as a surprise, including by Mark Meadows when he wrote his memoir about that. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=965.96s)]
*  We're now seeing evidence that it wasn't a surprise, that it wasn't an ad-lib, and [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=972.24s)]
*  that there was at least some planning, both involving the White House and numerous members [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=975.84s)]
*  of Congress, about the desirability of getting the crowd to converge on the Capitol building [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=980.88s)]
*  that day. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=987.4s)]
*  Is that important? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=988.4s)]
*  Is that just logistics, or is that important in terms of the overall issue of culpability here? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=989.4s)]
*  I think it's very important to the degree that members of Congress or the White House, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=996.4s)]
*  the former president, had as a part of their plan to bring that mob to the Capitol. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1001.56s)]
*  This was a way, even short of breaking into the building, of trying to interrupt, disrupt [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1007.64s)]
*  the joint session going on inside. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1014.52s)]
*  And particularly if there were members in the administration who understood that there [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1016.92s)]
*  would be the participation of these violent, racist, white nationalist groups, I think [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1021.0s)]
*  raises the culpability of those involved. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1028.12s)]
*  I would also say you asked whether Marjorie Tilligree or other members of Congress were [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1033.72s)]
*  violating the law. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1037.32s)]
*  One thing is abundantly clear, and that is they were violating their oath of office. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1038.72s)]
*  They were violating their pledge to uphold the Constitution. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1043.32s)]
*  If you have members of Congress essentially suggesting the president declare martial law [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1047.44s)]
*  to overturn the election, I can't imagine a more flagrant violation of their sworn oath [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1051.6399999999999s)]
*  to defend the Constitution. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1057.24s)]
*  Sadly, that's not disqualifying in today's GOP any more than Kevin McCarthy's lies. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1059.28s)]
*  Evidently, what disqualifies you in today's GOP is if you do uphold your oath and if you [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1064.32s)]
*  are willing to tell the truth, that puts you on a track outside of Kevin McCarthy and Donald [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1070.56s)]
*  Trump's GOP. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1077.16s)]
*  Congressman Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, sits on the January 6th Committee, chair of [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1079.96s)]
*  the Intelligence Committee. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1084.32s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1085.1200000000001s)]
*  It's a pleasure to have you here. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1087.04s)]
*  Thank you. Good to be with you. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1089.52s)]
*  I will just say what Congressman Schiff was saying there about this stuff not being disqualifying [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1091.72s)]
*  in today's GOP. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1096.28s)]
*  And we had crystal clear news of that this weekend as a lot of state Republican parties [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1097.32s)]
*  held their state conventions this weekend to pick their candidates. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1103.76s)]
*  In Michigan, we saw the state Republican Party this weekend by overwhelming votes choose a [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1107.3999999999999s)]
*  Republican candidate, choose their Republican candidate for the general election this fall, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1112.24s)]
*  both for secretary of state and attorney general. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1116.68s)]
*  They chose candidates in Michigan who are two people whose only claim to fame is that they [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1119.48s)]
*  are election denialists and are pledging that Michigan's vote was stolen and that Trump [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1124.04s)]
*  was rightfully reelected. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1131.0s)]
*  In Pennsylvania this weekend, we saw the gubernatorial debate. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1133.0800000000002s)]
*  The Trump endorsed candidate, former Senator David Perdue opened up that debate this weekend [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1136.68s)]
*  in Georgia by saying that the election was rigged and Trump's the rightful president. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1143.48s)]
*  We saw it at the Utah State Convention this weekend when Mike Lee recently revealed to have [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1147.8s)]
*  lied about how involved he was in trying to get states to participate in this illegal effort [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1152.2s)]
*  to throw out their election results and send Trump electors. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1157.0800000000002s)]
*  Mike Lee was just exposed for having lied about that. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1160.2s)]
*  He was greeted like a rock star this weekend at the Utah State Convention and, of course, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1162.8s)]
*  renominated to run again for his seat. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1166.76s)]
*  So what the congressman said there is right. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1169.0800000000002s)]
*  None of what's being revealed here is disqualifying in today's Republican Party. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1171.3200000000002s)]
*  The only thing that disqualifies you in today's Republican Party is not going along with the [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1174.5600000000002s)]
*  insurrection. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsspkswm5F0&t=1179.44s)]
