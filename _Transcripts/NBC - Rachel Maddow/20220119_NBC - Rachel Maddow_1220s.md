# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 18
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk)
*  But that was not even the craziest press conference Mr. Giuliani gave that month. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=0.0s)]
*  Just over a week later, he held another one, which would also go down in political history [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=4.38s)]
*  for something entirely unrelated to the spoken content of the event. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=7.7s)]
*  I'm talking, of course, about the What's That on His Face presser, the press conference [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=11.34s)]
*  at which Trump lawyer Mr. Giuliani appeared to be sort of melting before our eyes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  I know that is what you remember about that event. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=22.38s)]
*  None of us can ever forget it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=25.78s)]
*  What was that event for, of Event to Haunt Our Dreams Till We're Dead? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=29.040000000000003s)]
*  That event, ostensibly, was supposed to be a formal presentation by Rudy Giuliani and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=32.28s)]
*  his legal team about how the election had been stolen from Trump. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=37.660000000000004s)]
*  Giuliani told reporters at the Hair Die press conference that Trump had won Pennsylvania [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  by 300,000 votes and Michigan by 50,000 votes, and he could absolutely prove it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=46.6s)]
*  I mean, not that he had the evidence right then to show reporters that day, but he would [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=52.0s)]
*  have the evidence soon and everybody should get ready. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=55.64s)]
*  Evidence of all the corruption by the big city Democrats. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=59.22s)]
*  He said he knew crimes were committed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=61.58s)]
*  He could smell them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=63.66s)]
*  Another member of Trump's legal team, Sidney Powell, then took the podium and explained, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=67.6s)]
*  if you can call it that, that the election had been stolen by communists in Venezuela, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=72.5s)]
*  also Cuba, also China, and the voting machines had been hacked by Hugo Chavez, even though [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=77.66s)]
*  he's dead. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=83.54s)]
*  It's complicated, but trust us. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=84.54s)]
*  It works out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=85.54s)]
*  Another Trump lawyer, Jenna Ellis, then got up and yelled at the media, who were all there [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=87.2s)]
*  to cover their allegations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=91.18s)]
*  She yelled at them for not covering their allegations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=92.84s)]
*  Also joining them on stage at that event was a Trump campaign advisor named Boris Epstein. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  It was the gentleman spot shadowed there on the right side of your screen. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=101.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm pointing out all these folks because this evening, that whole crew from that Cuckoo [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=105.92s)]
*  for Cocoa Puffs press conference, all four of them, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=110.4s)]
*  Ellis, and Boris Epstein, they have all been subpoenaed by the January 6 investigation [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=114.1s)]
*  in Congress. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=118.9s)]
*  All four have been directed to produce documents to the investigation by the first of next [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=120.06s)]
*  month. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=125.3s)]
*  They've all been ordered to appear for depositions a week later. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=126.3s)]
*  Because as ridiculous as their quasi-legal efforts seemed at the time, as ridiculous [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=131.1s)]
*  as they seem even now in retrospect, the January 6 investigation is subpoenaing them, not because [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=136.42s)]
*  they're a joke, but quite the contrary. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=142.72s)]
*  From the perspective of the investigation, these clownish folks were allegedly involved [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  in the very worst of what was being plotted to overthrow the government and keep Trump [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=151.76s)]
*  in power even after he lost the election. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=155.92s)]
*  As with so many things related to the Trump era Republican Party, it's sort of simultaneously [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=159.76s)]
*  a clown show and a deadly serious threat. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Giuliani and the rest, these guys technically were Trump's legal team and they did bring [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  a number of lawsuits alleging election fraud and malfeasance and they were laughed out [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=174.62s)]
*  of court at every turn. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  In fact, Sidney Powell, the one with the communist plot by dead Hugo Chavez, she was actually [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=181.58s)]
*  sanctioned by one court and referred for possible disbarment by the judge because the election [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=187.26000000000002s)]
*  lawsuit she brought before that court was so baseless and full of obvious lies. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=191.58s)]
*  Mr. Giuliani has had his own trouble with his own legal license around these same matters. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=196.9s)]
*  But it doesn't appear that the January 6 investigation is subpoenaing this group because it's interested [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=202.4s)]
*  directly in those legal efforts such as they were. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  Judging by the letters accompanying the subpoenas tonight, the investigation is interested in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=209.84s)]
*  Mr. Giuliani and the legal team because of the ways those guys supported and facilitated [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=213.96s)]
*  the broader plot to try to overturn the election even beyond the courts. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=219.0s)]
*  I'll show you what I mean. This is from the letter to Mr. Giuliani tonight. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=224.0s)]
*  Quote, the investigation has revealed credible evidence that you publicly promoted claims [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=227.72s)]
*  that the 2020 election was stolen and participated in attempts to disrupt or delay the certification [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=231.96s)]
*  of the election results based on your allegations. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=237.44s)]
*  Remember disrupting or delaying the certification of the results on January 6, that became the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=242.16s)]
*  main goal of Trump and his allies, if nothing else so they could buy time to overturn the election. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=247.04s)]
*  Either through the courts or more likely given how the legal challenges were going by the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=253.16000000000003s)]
*  dozen, more likely some other way. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=257.64s)]
*  The letters from the investigation tonight specifically mentioned Mr. Giuliani's attempts, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=261.48s)]
*  often accompanied by Jenna Ellis, to convince Republican state legislators that they should [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  falsify the election results in their states and say Trump won when he didn't. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  He did this road show in the weeks after the election trying to get Republican legislators [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=275.02000000000004s)]
*  and swing states to declare the election invalid and instead send slates of Trump [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=278.64s)]
*  electors to Congress. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=284.0s)]
*  The investigation also claims to have witness testimony about Mr. Giuliani, quote, urging [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=286.8s)]
*  President Trump to direct the seizure of voting machines around the country after being told [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=291.44s)]
*  that the Department of Homeland Security had no lawful authority to do so. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=296.8s)]
*  Also, quote, according to public reporting on January 6th and the days prior, you were [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=301.24s)]
*  in contact. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=305.65999999999997s)]
*  This is the letter to Mr. Giuliani. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  You were in contact with then President Trump and members of Congress regarding strategies [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=308.2s)]
*  for delaying or overturning the results of the 2020 election. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=311.64s)]
*  We know that Mr. Giuliani was on the phone with Republican U.S. senators on January 6th, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=317.08s)]
*  even after the mob had stormed the Capitol, still trying to get them to stop or delay [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=322.24s)]
*  the certification of the election. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=326.44s)]
*  They were still that night, even after the mob attack on the Capitol, trying to find [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=328.44s)]
*  a way to falsify the election results and keep Trump in power. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=332.48s)]
*  The investigation's letter to Jenna Ellis specifically mentions two legal memos she [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=338.18s)]
*  prepared, purporting to explain how Vice President Pence should reject or delay accepting the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=342.14s)]
*  electoral votes from certain states, states that had submitted alternate slates of electors, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=347.90000000000003s)]
*  false slates of electors. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=353.62s)]
*  They never did succeed in getting Republican state legislatures and states Joe Biden won [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=357.18s)]
*  to send in official alternate slates of electors for Trump. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  But as we have been reporting on this show, nevertheless, Republicans in multiple states [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=365.78s)]
*  did sign forged documents claiming to be the real electors for their state, claiming that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=370.02s)]
*  they were the duly elected electors from their state and that Trump had won, which was all [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=374.9s)]
*  bullpucky and may be prosecuted in multiple jurisdictions now as a crime. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=379.5s)]
*  But it all appears to have been part of the same broad plan. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=385.7s)]
*  And the Trump allies subpoenaed today were, according to the investigation, all over every [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=388.76s)]
*  aspect of it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=393.73999999999995s)]
*  Through to Giuliani and Jenna Ellis trying to get state legislators to falsify the election [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=395.26s)]
*  results in the states. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  Ms. Ellis writing legal justifications for Vice President Pence to overturn the results [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=400.78s)]
*  and not accept the electoral count. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=405.65999999999997s)]
*  If that didn't work, Giuliani and Sidney Powell were trying to get President Trump to seize [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=408.64s)]
*  voting machines around the country and overturn the election himself with some sort of claims [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=412.92s)]
*  of military or executive power. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=417.42s)]
*  Boris Epstein was at the Willard Hotel at the so-called command center on January 6th, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=419.58s)]
*  allegedly talking by phone with President Trump about how they could stop certifying [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=423.86s)]
*  the election that day. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=428.02000000000004s)]
*  Somehow, one way or another, they were determined to make it happen. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=429.42s)]
*  And so it's no surprise that the January 6th investigation wants to talk to them, plans [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=435.22s)]
*  to compel them to talk by subpoena. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=440.62s)]
*  So Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has just submitted a proposed new map for congressional [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  districts in his state. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=453.02s)]
*  What he proposes is that Florida should cut in half the number of congressional districts [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=454.74s)]
*  that are majority black. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=459.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=462.97999999999996s)]
*  Texas's largest counties are now starting to report on the real world impact of the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=465.14s)]
*  voting restrictions that Texas Republicans passed this past year. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=469.34s)]
*  As many as half the ballot requests they're getting from voters in the state's largest [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=473.29999999999995s)]
*  counties are now being rejected by the state because the new voting rights restrictions [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=477.02s)]
*  they just passed requires that those ballot requests be rejected. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=482.46s)]
*  Half the ballot requests being turned away. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=487.62s)]
*  In Wisconsin, where Republican legislators have been moving aggressively to restrict [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=491.06s)]
*  all sorts of voting methods, a state court judge just sided with them and ruled that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=494.9s)]
*  Wisconsin can, in fact, remove its drop boxes that people use to drop off their ballots [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=499.5s)]
*  for the election. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=506.09999999999997s)]
*  Wisconsin's next election is less than a month from now, so they are rushing to rip [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=508.14s)]
*  out the drop boxes and give people fewer places to vote with less than a month to go. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=512.42s)]
*  Gotta hurry. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=517.5s)]
*  People found it very safe, very secure, very convenient to vote that way. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=518.5s)]
*  As recently as the last election, the next one's coming out quick. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=521.1s)]
*  That must be stopped. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=524.34s)]
*  Today in Washington, D.C., conservative Democratic Senator Joe Manchin appeared before reporters. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=528.66s)]
*  I'll tell you, he was wearing like kind of a gym suit. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=533.34s)]
*  It was like a tunic of some kind. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=536.06s)]
*  I'm only saying that just so you're not jarred by his appearance in this next clip. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=537.82s)]
*  He was at the U.S. Capitol, but he was wearing this like sporty outfit. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=541.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=545.1s)]
*  Anyway, he told reporters sort of scornfully while he was answering their questions that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=546.1s)]
*  he and Senator Kyrsten Sinema working with Republicans to block federal voting rights [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=550.6600000000001s)]
*  protections that will in no way result in people not being able to vote in the next [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=555.0200000000001s)]
*  election. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=560.1400000000001s)]
*  He said that won't happen in the next election because the government won't allow it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=561.54s)]
*  I know you don't know what that could possibly mean. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=569.0999999999999s)]
*  I know you think I'm paraphrasing him in a way that is obscuring what he must have meant, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=571.38s)]
*  but honestly, that's what we've got. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=576.26s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=579.3s)]
*  Senator Manchin, what would you say to voters of color who say that your inability or your [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=580.3s)]
*  obstruction of the voting rights... [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=586.3399999999999s)]
*  There's no obstruction whatsoever. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=587.9399999999999s)]
*  But there are a lot of people out there who are saying that you're making it so that they're [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=589.34s)]
*  not going to be able to vote in the next election. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=592.3000000000001s)]
*  The law's there, the rules are there, and basically the government. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=595.1s)]
*  The government will stand behind them and make sure they have a right to vote. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=597.98s)]
*  We have that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=600.82s)]
*  The government will stand in the way. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=604.86s)]
*  The government will do that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=609.36s)]
*  That's the exact phrase he used there? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=610.62s)]
*  The law's there, the rules are there. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  Basically the government, the government will stand behind them so they have the right [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=615.22s)]
*  to vote. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=618.6600000000001s)]
*  We have that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=619.6600000000001s)]
*  Who's the government in this construction? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=622.02s)]
*  Senator Joe Manchin actually has it in his personal hands whether or not the government [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=626.6600000000001s)]
*  will stand behind people to protect their right to vote. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=632.46s)]
*  Right now, thanks to him, it is the government in places like Florida, places like Texas, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=636.1800000000001s)]
*  places like Wisconsin, places like Georgia. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=641.1800000000001s)]
*  It is the government in those places, the state government controlled by Republicans, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=643.08s)]
*  that in fact is making it so people can't vote or can't have their votes counted or [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=647.6s)]
*  have their vote diluted to such an extent that their votes basically don't count no [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=651.64s)]
*  matter how potently and completely they and their cohort votes for their chosen representative. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=656.6s)]
*  The existing Federal Voting Rights Act was gutted by the United States Supreme Court [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=665.64s)]
*  by Republican-appointed judges. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=669.5600000000001s)]
*  The restrictions on voting rights we're now seeing, like this one in Texas, they can't [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=672.28s)]
*  be blocked anymore by the federal government. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=678.52s)]
*  This new law in Texas that's having the state required by law to throw out half the ballot [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=681.62s)]
*  applications, it's law. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=687.46s)]
*  It is new law they made in Texas. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=691.4s)]
*  It is in effect. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=693.0s)]
*  It's not being blocked by anything. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=694.0s)]
*  The state government has radically rescinded voting rights there. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=696.1s)]
*  No one's coming to the rescue because of Joe Manchin. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=700.5799999999999s)]
*  The federal government can only help in those instances if Congress acts, if Congress passes [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=704.9s)]
*  legislation to let the federal government step in and establish federal minimum standards [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=709.9s)]
*  in terms of voting rights and the administration of elections. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=715.42s)]
*  It's Joe Manchin and Kirsten Sinema in the United States Senate who are working with [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=719.7199999999999s)]
*  Republican senators to stop that from happening. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=723.74s)]
*  But Senator Manchin says, you know, don't worry. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=727.9s)]
*  He sure, as is all overblown, the government will fix it somehow. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=731.02s)]
*  As if it's not the government that is blocking people from voting, the Republican-led state [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=736.34s)]
*  government that is blocking people from voting in these states. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=740.66s)]
*  And as if he's not the government. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=745.38s)]
*  As if he's not the reason that the federal government can't step in to fix this stuff. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=750.54s)]
*  The federal government could step in and fix this stuff. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=755.6999999999999s)]
*  It is those two senators working with Republicans that are blocking that from happening. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=757.8s)]
*  In the great state of Georgia today, where the Republican leadership in that state has [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=763.8s)]
*  also this past year, radically restricted the voting rights of Georgia residents. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=766.9599999999999s)]
*  Republicans have just moved another one of their own officials into position so they [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=771.92s)]
*  can use the new powers they just gave themselves to get rid of the elections boards in mostly [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=775.16s)]
*  Democratic counties and instead have all Republican officials oversee the vote in those Democratic [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=780.0999999999999s)]
*  areas. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=784.7199999999999s)]
*  Today's move by Georgia Republicans was their next major step toward taking over Fulton [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=785.72s)]
*  County, Georgia, where more Democratic votes are cast in that state than in any other county. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=789.96s)]
*  Republicans are kicking out the local elections officials and taking it over for themselves. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=795.44s)]
*  Why do you think they'd want to do that? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=800.84s)]
*  But don't worry. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=804.72s)]
*  Senator Joe Manchin said, surely the government will help in a case like this. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=805.72s)]
*  Surely the government won't let this happen. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=809.8000000000001s)]
*  This is the government. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=812.72s)]
*  This is the Republican-led state government of Georgia moving radically to rescind voting [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=814.36s)]
*  rights. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=819.16s)]
*  We do not have federal standards to block this kind of thing because of Senator Joe [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=820.16s)]
*  Manchin and Senator Kirsten Sinema working with Republican senators to make sure nothing [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=823.48s)]
*  gets in the way of whatever the Republican-led states want to do. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=827.84s)]
*  Today was just, you know, scene after scene, scenes from a country that is trying to save [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=835.44s)]
*  itself. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=840.2s)]
*  In Michigan today, the attorney general, Dana Nessel, answered questions from local reporters [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=842.76s)]
*  about her reasoning in asking the U.S. Attorney's Office in Michigan to bring a federal criminal [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=847.48s)]
*  investigation of 16 Republicans who signed and submitted a forged document claiming to [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=853.04s)]
*  be the state's electors after the last election, when in fact they were not. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=858.8s)]
*  She reiterated the argument that she made the day that she made the referral to federal [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=863.34s)]
*  prosecutors saying that she believes this makes the most sense as a federal investigation. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=867.08s)]
*  But interestingly, speaking with local reporters today, she also clarified that if the federal [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=871.9599999999999s)]
*  U.S. Justice Department chooses not to pursue a prosecution in this case, her office does [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=875.8399999999999s)]
*  absolutely believe there's plenty enough evidence to prosecute these 16 Republicans under Michigan [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=882.38s)]
*  state law. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=887.92s)]
*  At this point, do you think that there is enough evidence, if you wanted to, to bring [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=891.7199999999999s)]
*  charges against these electors under state law? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=898.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=902.48s)]
*  Absolutely. OK. And then a second question. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=903.48s)]
*  Have you interviewed or are any of these individuals cooperating with your investigation of what [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=907.32s)]
*  you've done so far? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=912.84s)]
*  Yeah, I can't comment on the investigation at this point. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  I will say that, again, I feel confident that we have enough evidence to charge. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=919.4000000000001s)]
*  Should we decide to pursue that? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=922.44s)]
*  Again, I want to make it clear. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=924.48s)]
*  I haven't ruled it out, but for all the reasons I stated, I think that it's a better idea [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=925.84s)]
*  for the feds to pursue this. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=930.64s)]
*  But technically, it is an ongoing investigation, even though we have given everything that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=933.88s)]
*  we have to the feds so that they will have that information should they wish to pursue [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=939.88s)]
*  it. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=944.72s)]
*  It is not as though we have made a determination that we are certainly not going to charge. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=945.72s)]
*  So I am just sort of waiting to see what it is that that they'll decide to do. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=950.68s)]
*  These 16 individuals could be prosecuted under state law. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=957.08s)]
*  I'm not denying that at all. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=961.12s)]
*  I'm saying that if one of your goals is to find out who orchestrated this, again, seemingly [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=962.92s)]
*  there is a conspiracy that occurred between multiple states. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=969.4s)]
*  So if what your ultimate goal is, is not just to prosecute these 16 individuals, but to [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=972.8s)]
*  find out, you know, who put them up to this? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=979.8s)]
*  Is this part of a bigger conspiracy at play in order to undermine the legitimate results [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=982.9599999999999s)]
*  of the 2020 presidential election, not just in Michigan, but nationally? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=989.56s)]
*  It's going to involve interviews in other states, and it's going to involve possible [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=995.3199999999999s)]
*  prosecutions in other places. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1000.04s)]
*  Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel speaking with reporters in Michigan today, making the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1004.8s)]
*  case that the part of the Republican plot to try to overthrow the government and keep [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1009.36s)]
*  Donald Trump in power after he lost the last election, the part of that that involves some [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1014.96s)]
*  sort of coordinated effort to have Republicans in multiple states forge documents saying [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1019.4s)]
*  that they were their state's electors when they were not. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1025.24s)]
*  Attorney General Nessel says her office believes that that can be charged as a crime under [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1029.24s)]
*  Michigan law, and they have absolutely enough evidence to do so. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1033.2s)]
*  But she said they believe the larger scheme should be pursued by the federal government [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1037.16s)]
*  because it wasn't just in Michigan, it was in multiple states. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1040.52s)]
*  Again, that was the attorney general of the great state of Michigan, Dana Nessel, speaking [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1043.5600000000002s)]
*  with reporters today. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1047.5600000000002s)]
*  And I have to tell you tonight, just before we got on the air, we got news that yet another [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1048.5600000000002s)]
*  state is investigating this matter as a potential crime. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1052.9s)]
*  We have this federal referral from the attorney general in Michigan that she was just describing [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1057.4s)]
*  there with local reporters. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1061.0s)]
*  As we reported here last night, the attorney general in the state of New Mexico, attorney [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1062.92s)]
*  general Hector Balderas, he says that he too is referring this matter to the U.S. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1067.36s)]
*  attorney in New Mexico for potential prosecution as a federal crime. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1071.52s)]
*  And now there's this from the attorney general in the state of Nevada, Aaron Ford, quote, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1075.56s)]
*  Our office has received numerous inquiries regarding some members of the state Republican [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1080.28s)]
*  Party attempting to award fake electoral votes to former President Donald Trump after the [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1083.68s)]
*  2020 election. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1088.4s)]
*  While we cannot confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, rest assured that this [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1089.92s)]
*  matter is on our radar and we take seriously any efforts to rob Nevadans of their votes. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1095.0s)]
*  There's been a sustained effort to invalidate the 2020 election and to downplay the shocking [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1101.0800000000002s)]
*  actions that took place afterward. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1104.68s)]
*  My office cannot and will not accept any efforts to overturn a free and fair election. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1107.0800000000002s)]
*  Voting rights are fundamental to our Democratic Republic and we will continue to protect them. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1111.5600000000002s)]
*  Again, so to recap, in Michigan, the state attorney general has referred those Republicans [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1117.0s)]
*  who signed the fake electoral documents, referred them to federal prosecutors for potential [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1122.8799999999999s)]
*  federal criminal prosecution. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1126.76s)]
*  The same thing has happened in the state of New Mexico, where the attorney general in [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1128.8s)]
*  the state of New Mexico has made a similar referral to federal prosecutors. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1131.9599999999998s)]
*  Now in the state of Nevada, we've got this statement from the attorney general saying [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1136.1999999999998s)]
*  we cannot confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, but rest assured that this [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1139.84s)]
*  matter is on our radar. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1143.8s)]
*  I don't know what that means in legal terms, but there you have it. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1145.6s)]
*  We do know the January 6th investigation in Congress is looking at least broadly at this [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1150.24s)]
*  part of the plot by which Republicans in at least five different states filled out these [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1156.6000000000001s)]
*  forged documents pretending to be electors and those documents were sent into Congress. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1162.48s)]
*  So we know that the January 6th investigation is looking at it. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1169.4s)]
*  That in fact is some of the way that we were able to find out some of the reporting, some [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1172.0800000000002s)]
*  of the sort of reporting trails that everybody was able to follow in order to figure out [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1176.76s)]
*  that these documents existed, that they were all similar, they were all part of a coordinated [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1180.8s)]
*  effort and that the January 6th investigation is looking at them. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1184.76s)]
*  So we know the January 6th investigators are on this at least in some way. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1188.3600000000001s)]
*  Now we know the U.S. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1192.52s)]
*  Justice Department has formally been asked in at least two states to contend with it [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1193.52s)]
*  as well. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOfwIqqfqqk&t=1197.4s)]
