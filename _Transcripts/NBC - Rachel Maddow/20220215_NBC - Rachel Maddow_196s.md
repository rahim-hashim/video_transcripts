# Letter To Pence Shows Fake Elector Scheme Being Put In Motion
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU)
*  For months now reporters across the country have been trying to get answers from those fake Trump electors about who told them to carry out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=0.0s)]
*  this multi-state scheme [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=7.62s)]
*  Here's what it looked like when an Arizona reporter put the question to one of that state's fake Trump electors [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=10.28s)]
*  Did you have direction from anybody in doing this was it you [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=18.88s)]
*  Eleven yourself doing this or did someone give you advice on the matter in which you can do it? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=23.44s)]
*  So I'm simply I was one of the electors right I'm not in charge of the electors [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=29.12s)]
*  So you would how did you hear about you? You would you hear you would need to ask the party [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=33.78s)]
*  How did you hear about the plan? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=37.64s)]
*  You just told to be someone you would need to ask the party chair that you're the you're the person who received the call [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  You showed up, right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=44.0s)]
*  How did you know to show up that so as I said you can go ahead and ask the party chair the logistics of it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=44.96s)]
*  Ask her how you got a phone call to go somewhere. You're welcome to talk to them about do you not know how you arrived at a place? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=50.36s)]
*  Thank you, I appreciate it. Really not know how you got a call [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=55.82s)]
*  That was Arizona State representative Jake Hoffman trying desperately to seem like he really does not know [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=63.7s)]
*  How he ended up becoming one of those fraudulent electors for Donald Trump [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=70.54s)]
*  well today [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=74.82s)]
*  We have unearthed what we believe to be some exclusive [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  Never seen before documents ones showing just how involved in the scheme State representative Jake Hoffman really was on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=79.94s)]
*  January 5th 2021 just one day before the attack on the Capitol [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=88.54s)]
*  Hoffman sent an email to three White House staffers in that email [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=93.9s)]
*  He attached what he described as a quote urgent letter for the vice president and asked that a copy of it be shared with then [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=98.6s)]
*  President Trump as well [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=105.26s)]
*  Here is what that letter said quote dear mr [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=107.06s)]
*  Vice president I write to you on the eve of January 6th joint session of the United States Congress to approve the certification of the 2020 [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=110.46s)]
*  presidential election to request that you in your capacity as the president of the Senate and the presiding officer over the aforementioned joint session of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=117.82s)]
*  Congress [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=125.62s)]
*  delay the certification of the election results and instead seek clarification from the Arizona legislature as to which slate of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  Presidential electors are proper and accurate [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=136.34s)]
*  Again, this is the same Jake Hoffman who responded to questions about his role in the scheme by essentially saying who me? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=140.38s)]
*  I don't know anything about it ask someone else [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=148.0s)]
*  One White House staffer who received that email wrote back. Thanks Jake. I have shared the letter with a key member of the president's team [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=152.62s)]
*  Which is something that might be of interest to January 6th investigators [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=161.26s)]
*  I should note we have reached out for comment to Arizona State Representative Jake Hoffman and the White House staffer who responded to his email [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=165.82s)]
*  We have not yet heard back [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=173.64s)]
*  You [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAJQPberU&t=195.66s)]
