# Maddow: Trump looking to 'raise the civic cost' of potential indictment
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI)
*  Joining me now by phone is my colleague Rachel Maddow, host of the Rachel Maddow show here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=0.0s)]
*  on MSNBC. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=6.2s)]
*  Rachel, thank you so much for joining us this Saturday morning. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=7.44s)]
*  What do you make of Trump's latest post? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=11.76s)]
*  He's made a lot of claims and called for his supporters to protest other things in the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  past. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=18.04s)]
*  But is there something different about this one? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=19.04s)]
*  RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC RATCHEL MADDOW, MSNBC RATCHEL MADDOW, MSNBC RATCHEL MADDOW, MSNBC [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=21.92s)]
*  RATCHEL MADDOW, MSNBC RATCHEL MADDOW, MSNBC RATCHEL MADDOW, MSNBC RATCHEL MADDOW, MSNBC [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=22.92s)]
*  I'm sorry I couldn't get in to the studio in time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  I wasn't expecting this on a Saturday morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=26.720000000000002s)]
*  You know, I think that we have to be measured in our response to this just because we don't, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=30.0s)]
*  as you so rightfully pointed out, we don't have any indication that Trump is responding [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=37.92s)]
*  to some communication from the DA's office or some act within the criminal justice system [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  that we don't have, we the public don't have access to. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=49.44s)]
*  It kind of seems like he's just responding to NBC News reporting yesterday that law [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=52.48s)]
*  enforcement agencies are preparing for the possibility that he might be indicted. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=58.48s)]
*  He's just kind of yelling at the TV. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=62.72s)]
*  So I don't, I think it is possible to overinterpret what's going on here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=64.64s)]
*  But those, that reporting from NBC is real, and the prospect that Trump might be indicted [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=69.6s)]
*  is real. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=75.12s)]
*  And so with these posts, we know what his response to that will be. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=76.8s)]
*  We don't know what his response will be in the courtroom. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=81.96s)]
*  I don't think we've had a clear view of what his legal defense is going to be, but his [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=83.72s)]
*  overall defense is going to be to try to raise the civic cost of indicting him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=88.08s)]
*  He is trying to bring intimidation and pressure to bear against the prosecutors who are considering [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=94.72s)]
*  right now whether to indict him. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  And he's hoping to create fear that there'll be another January 6th type events or, you [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=102.91999999999999s)]
*  know, his followers will go shoot up another FBI officer or, you know, something else that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=107.0s)]
*  he could he could cause to happen by asking his followers to go into the streets in his [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=110.92s)]
*  defense. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=115.8s)]
*  I'm glad you brought that up. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=116.8s)]
*  And I love that phrasing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=118.24s)]
*  Raise the civic cost of indicting him. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=120.64s)]
*  And I'm just wondering, it's hard not to recall January 6th when you read a post like the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=124.1s)]
*  one he put out this morning. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=129.64s)]
*  And I want you to talk further with how concerned are you? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  And should people be concerned that that Trump's supporters will see this as a call to action? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=134.46s)]
*  Well, he's trying to make it that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=142.58s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that I've been sort of poking around thinking about and trying [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=144.10000000000002s)]
*  to do some research on this week is trying to quantify the number of public officials [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=149.18s)]
*  and former public officials who get arrested and indicted for stuff. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=154.86s)]
*  And it's it's taken me a few days. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  I've been poking around at it for a while because it's essentially an infinite number. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=161.06s)]
*  There are so many state senators, big city mayors, governors, members of Congress, former [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=165.9s)]
*  members of Congress, statewide elected officials of other kinds who get arrested and indicted [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=173.34s)]
*  and thrown out of office and occasionally jailed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=178.6s)]
*  It just happens all the time. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=180.94s)]
*  And it's not the end of the world. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=183.1s)]
*  It's not even the political end of the world for some of those figures. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=185.2s)]
*  I was looking back at Huey Long, who I think is one of the historical figures we've got [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=189.3s)]
*  in this country, who's most analogous to Trump in terms of the effect that he has on his [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  supporters. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=198.58s)]
*  And Huey Long, what is his great laugh lines, what is his great applause lines that they [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=199.58s)]
*  sort of apex of his political career when he was getting ready to challenge FDR in 1936 [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=203.82000000000002s)]
*  before he was assassinated and wasn't able to do it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=209.18s)]
*  One of Huey Long's great laugh lines was about how many times he had escaped indictment. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=212.78s)]
*  How they tried to impeach him and they tried to indict him and it just made him stronger [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  and stronger and stronger. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=222.10000000000002s)]
*  Getting arrested, getting indicted, even going to jail isn't the end of the line. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=223.26000000000002s)]
*  It isn't the end of the world. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=227.74s)]
*  But Trump is trying to make it that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  He's trying to make it so that there is a threat of uncontrollable political violence in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=231.9s)]
*  this country that is triggered, that would be triggered by any any act of the legal system [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=237.9s)]
*  against him. It's his effort. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=243.78s)]
*  There's nothing intrinsic about him getting in trouble as a potentially publicly corrupt [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  public corrupt figure that should cause violence. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=250.82s)]
*  But he's trying to make sure that it does. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=254.5s)]
*  And the question is whether his followers do it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=256.3s)]
*  And, you know, to that point, you anticipated the next question I was going to ask you, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=258.86s)]
*  given this long history of public officials up and down, up and down the roster being [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=263.98s)]
*  arrested and some of them viewing it as a good thing, using the number of times they've [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=270.3s)]
*  been indicted as a punchline in campaign speeches. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=275.26s)]
*  Is this good for Trump politically? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=279.18s)]
*  Because he is right now a declared candidate for president. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=282.53999999999996s)]
*  Yes, I mean, I think that he's banking on it being something that helps him. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=288.09999999999997s)]
*  But he is playing with a fire that he doesn't know how to contain and that nobody knows [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  how to contain. Right. I mean, I think it is a little unnerving that his first political [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=297.94s)]
*  campaign appearance for his 2024 run is in Waco. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=304.02s)]
*  Right. We're at the 30th anniversary of the Waco standoff. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=308.14s)]
*  Right. If you're talking about trying to trying to engender militant consciousness [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=311.46s)]
*  among Americans about the need to fight the federal government with violence. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=319.62s)]
*  Well, Waco is a nice place to try to do that from. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=323.78s)]
*  That's a nice resonant place to try to do that from. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=326.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, him being indicted on a charge related to campaign finance, tax and business [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=328.97999999999996s)]
*  fraud, again, doesn't have to be the end of the world for him and could potentially be [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=338.02s)]
*  a positive for him. But if he's asking for a militant, racially tinged, violent [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=343.62s)]
*  response from his followers, that's something that won't be good for him. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=351.94s)]
*  You know, January 6th is not good for Trump's political legacy, for all the other things [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=355.78000000000003s)]
*  that it is, for all the other things it means for our country. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=360.18s)]
*  It didn't make him more electable for coming back as another term as president. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=362.26s)]
*  And so he's he's trying to start something that I don't think he can I don't think he [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=367.1s)]
*  can take responsibility for how it will finish. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=371.58s)]
*  And so I just I don't I just don't think it's wise on his part, just a pure political [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=373.7s)]
*  strategy for him to be calling for what he's calling for. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=378.06s)]
*  Rachel, let me get you on one more thing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=381.3s)]
*  Just yesterday, YouTube reinstated Donald Trump's account, which means he's now back [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=382.94s)]
*  on all major social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=388.1s)]
*  Granted, this post was on his own social media platform. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=391.9s)]
*  But should those companies regret the move to reinstate him and giving him access to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=396.3s)]
*  millions of Americans? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=401.42s)]
*  Well, I mean, we'll see. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=404.22s)]
*  I think those companies are in a bit of a crisis of conscience right now in terms of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=405.62s)]
*  what their business plan is and how much they want to benefit from undermining the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=411.02s)]
*  democracy that makes it possible for them to thrive as companies. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=415.58s)]
*  So I mean, I think I think companies like Facebook, Metta and and Google and YouTube, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=418.74s)]
*  they need to figure out whether or not they're going to let a nihilist like Elon Musk set [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=428.06s)]
*  the tone in terms of what counts as corporate responsibility for something that really does [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=433.62s)]
*  have the possibility to to to unlace our democracy in a way that's irreversible or [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=438.22s)]
*  whether they have a sense of self as companies and a sense of responsibility for who they [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=443.66s)]
*  are and what it takes, what kind of legal environment they require and which to operate. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=447.3s)]
*  And and there may I'm hoping that there'll be a reckoning on their own terms and they [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=453.3s)]
*  won't be forced to act like they were after January 6. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPtnuv4VTBI&t=457.98s)]
