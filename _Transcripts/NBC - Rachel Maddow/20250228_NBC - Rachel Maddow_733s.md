# 'Who's that good for?': Maddow connects the dots on Donald Trump's behavior toward Russia
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY)
*  Republicans are having a hard time with this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=0.0s)]
*  They try to move on to the next question, they express annoyance with their own constituents [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=2.84s)]
*  for asking about it, they get brusque and short in their answers, or like Senator Lisa [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Murkowski, they just purport to be really perplexed, really confused, really scratching [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=12.44s)]
*  my head. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=17.02s)]
*  They have a hard time with this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=18.02s)]
*  All the Republicans do. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Especially the guy at the top. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  You just mentioned Putin though, and this has been this controversy the past week. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=26.08s)]
*  Can you say yes or no whether you have talked to Vladimir Putin since you stopped being [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  president? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Well I don't comment on that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  If I have a relationship... [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  That sounds very much like you did talk to him. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't talk about that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  No, I don't talk about that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  You talk about talking to Netanyahu. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't ever say it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't talk about that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't ever say. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Why don't you talk about it? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't ever say about... [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=51.28s)]
*  Why not? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=53.2s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=54.32s)]
*  I mean that was right before the election. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=55.56s)]
*  But it continued after the election. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=58.84s)]
*  And people get so mad when I play this tape. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=60.82s)]
*  People get very angry with me when I play this tape. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=62.94s)]
*  You know, honestly bring it on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=65.56s)]
*  It makes me appreciate it all the more because clearly, at least it strikes a nerve. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=67.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=72.16s)]
*  Have you talked to President Putin? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=73.16s)]
*  No I have not. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=75.4s)]
*  You haven't talked to President Putin since you've been elected? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=76.4s)]
*  No I have not. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=77.4s)]
*  You mean no... [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=78.4s)]
*  Well I don't want to say that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=79.4s)]
*  But I haven't spoken to him recently. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=80.76s)]
*  So you've spoken to President Putin since you've been elected? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=82.52s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to say anything about that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=85.28s)]
*  I have not spoken to President Putin. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=86.28s)]
*  Who have you spoken to? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to say. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=90.12s)]
*  So you've already spoken of Vladimir Putin? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=91.12s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=92.36000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to say? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to say? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  I can't say? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=97.88000000000001s)]
*  Why can't you say? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  Why can't you say? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  What precludes you from saying? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=102.26s)]
*  Listen, it's Friday night. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=105.04s)]
*  Let's just do this. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  Let's just cut to the chase here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  Let's do a little look-see at the landscape to see why exactly it is so hard for Republicans [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=111.72s)]
*  to deal with this topic. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=118.94s)]
*  What exactly is so hard for Republicans to talk about? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=120.12s)]
*  What exactly is it that we are doing? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=123.92s)]
*  Up to and including switching sides in a war. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=125.84s)]
*  But it's not limited to that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=130.0s)]
*  And it's all things that don't seem like good news for the United States. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=133.44s)]
*  That makes them particularly hard to talk about. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=137.2s)]
*  Nevertheless, with Donald Trump back in the White House, we keep doing these things relentlessly [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=140.23999999999998s)]
*  and urgently, and they all cut in the same direction. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  It's really hard for Republicans to explain because of what it obviously means. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  It's clear why they do not want to talk about this stuff, and it gets all the more clear [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=154.0s)]
*  when you just line this stuff up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=157.48s)]
*  Let me show you what I mean. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=159.04s)]
*  Here's one. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=160.04s)]
*  Donald Trump's hand-picked attorney general, she gets sworn in to lead the US Justice Department. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=162.04s)]
*  On her first day on the job, what is the first thing she does? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=166.88s)]
*  Headline. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=170.44s)]
*  US cuts task forces on foreign influence and Russian sanctions. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=171.44s)]
*  Quote, in a memo sent to staff Wednesday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi revealed she [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=175.92s)]
*  had disbanded the Foreign Influence Task Force, a unit dedicated to investigating violations [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=180.32s)]
*  of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  Bondi did not elaborate, but figures on the Republican Party's conspiratorial far right [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=189.44s)]
*  have accused the government of abusing Farah to unfairly target political operatives, like [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=194.72s)]
*  Paul Manafort, Trump's 2016 campaign chair, who was indicted in a probe into Russian influence [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=200.12s)]
*  in that year's US election. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=206.2s)]
*  Also on Wednesday, the day of her swearing in, Bondi disbanded Task Force klepto-capture, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  an initiative started in 2022 to enforce sanctions against Russia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=216.6s)]
*  Who's all that good for? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=224.84s)]
*  Shutting down the Foreign Influence Task Force, shutting down enforcement of the Foreign Agents [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=225.84s)]
*  Registration Act, and getting rid of the task force that enforces sanctions against Russia. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=232.12s)]
*  Who are all those things good for? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  Why do we do those things? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=240.2s)]
*  And so urgently, her first day on the job. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=241.94s)]
*  Here's another one, which happened that same day. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=244.96s)]
*  Quote, in a little notice directive on her first day in office, Attorney General Pam [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=246.8s)]
*  Bondi ordered a halt to a years old federal law enforcement effort to combat secret influence [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=250.52s)]
*  campaigns by China, Russia, and other adversaries that try to curry favor and sow chaos in American [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=256.24s)]
*  politics. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=262.0s)]
*  Buried on the fourth page of one of 14 policy memos Bondi issued Wednesday, the order disbands [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=263.24s)]
*  the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=268.64s)]
*  Last year, Justice Department prosecutors and FBI agents exposed an alleged scheme [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=270.88s)]
*  in which Russia-backed media funneled $10 million to a conservative U.S. media company [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  that hired prominent right-wing influencers. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=281.26s)]
*  Here's how the New York Times bannered that one bluntly. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=285.44s)]
*  Quote, Trump dismantles government fight against foreign influence operations. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=289.04s)]
*  Dozens of employees who had been working to fight foreign interference in U.S. elections [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=293.71999999999997s)]
*  have been reassigned or forced out. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=298.16s)]
*  That includes not only the FBI, but also CISA, the Cybersecurity Division at Homeland Security. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=301.36s)]
*  Which we soon learned, the president's top campaign donor had installed a 19-year-old [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=308.28s)]
*  operative who reportedly personally operates websites in Russia and who has been associated [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=316.56s)]
*  with multiple criminal cyber hacking gangs. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=322.12s)]
*  That's who the president's top campaign donor installed at CISA, giving him full access [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  to systems and data at the U.S. government's Cybersecurity Agency. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=331.8s)]
*  A 19-year-old kid with ties to Russia and cybercrime. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=336.96s)]
*  Who's that good for? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=343.8s)]
*  How do you explain to your constituents who that's good for and why we are doing that [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=344.8s)]
*  as a country? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=351.08s)]
*  And what else? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=352.08s)]
*  What else is hard to explain to ye olde constituents when it comes to that radical switch in the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=353.72s)]
*  U.S. government that Lisa Murkowski described? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=358.56s)]
*  How about this? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=361.0s)]
*  Headline, CIA plans largest mass firing in nearly 50 years. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=362.0s)]
*  That's good for someone. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=368.0s)]
*  Who's that good for? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=369.0s)]
*  That came right after this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  Oh, Trump's new hand-picked CIA director sent a list of CIA employees to the White House [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=372.6s)]
*  in an unclassified email. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=379.6s)]
*  Quote, current officials confirm that the CIA had sent the names of employees to the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=382.4s)]
*  Office of Personnel Management complying with an executive order signed by President Trump. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  Senator Mark Warner, top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, wrote that the sharing of the officer's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=391.0s)]
*  names was a quote, disastrous national security development. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  One former agency officer called the reporting of the names in an unclassified email a quote, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=400.44s)]
*  counterintelligence disaster. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  Ah yes, a disaster for the United States, and for U.S. intelligence in particular. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=407.92s)]
*  But very good news for someone. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=413.56s)]
*  Hey, speaking of things that ought to be classified. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=415.8s)]
*  Headline, how Trump's security clearances order could make the U.S. vulnerable. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=420.64s)]
*  The plan to give temporary security clearances without background checks opens the door to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=426.56s)]
*  breaches and espionage, experts say. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=432.12s)]
*  Giving out security clearances without background checks that look for things like criminal [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=437.04s)]
*  entanglements, lots of debt, anything that they could blackmail you over, or any contacts [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=442.44s)]
*  with foreign governments. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  To make sure that you're not, you know, secretly working for, we're not doing the background [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  checks anymore, Trump just has ordered that the classified material be made available [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=455.12s)]
*  to whoever he says with no checks. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=460.8s)]
*  That doesn't seem like good news for the United States. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=463.92s)]
*  But again, it's good news for someone. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=466.12s)]
*  How about when they decided that the first agency they would destroy would be USAID? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=470.56s)]
*  Who cheered the loudest for that? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=476.76s)]
*  Russia welcomes USAID cuts, calls agency machine for interfering. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=480.72s)]
*  Yeah, it was fantastic news for someone. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=485.64s)]
*  No one was seen to benefit more or to be more loudly cheering it on than Vladimir Putin. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=489.98s)]
*  And that was before the specific news confirmed today that among the projects Trump is explicitly [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=497.94s)]
*  and specifically turning off right now, this week, is the program by which the U.S. helps [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=503.66s)]
*  Ukraine keep its electric grid up and running. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=508.94s)]
*  Even though Russia has repeatedly targeted that electric grid throughout the war, because [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=513.04s)]
*  Russia's idea of how it wants to win the unprovoked war it declared on our ally is [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=517.42s)]
*  to make the civilian population, including kids and the elderly and hospital patients [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=522.14s)]
*  and everyone, their best idea for how to prosecute that war is to cause them to freeze to death [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=526.38s)]
*  by bombing the electric grid in February. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=532.3s)]
*  So more than any other evident targeting, they have targeted the electric grid that [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=537.62s)]
*  serves the civilian population in Ukraine. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=544.56s)]
*  It is the United States that has helped Ukraine masterfully keep the power grid up despite [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=549.1199999999999s)]
*  those repeated onslaughts by Russia. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  Until this week when Trump just cut it off. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  Which is good news for someone, right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=565.28s)]
*  When Trump dressed up the defense secretary, he handpicked off the cast of the Fox and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=571.36s)]
*  Friends weekend show, put him in a bright blue suit and sent him to Europe where he [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=575.08s)]
*  volunteered unasked that Ukraine can't be expected to keep all of its own territory. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  He said that would be quote, unrealistic. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=585.26s)]
*  It would be quote, unrealistic to not let Russia take parts of Ukraine. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=587.82s)]
*  He then volunteered unasked that Ukraine will not be allowed to join NATO. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  Now we've got pro-Trump Republican senators saying, yeah, not just Ukraine won't be allowed [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=599.56s)]
*  in NATO, we ought to get out of NATO too. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=605.56s)]
*  Which of course would collapse NATO. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=609.2399999999999s)]
*  Who would that most benefit? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=612.4599999999999s)]
*  For whom would that be really, really good news? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=614.64s)]
*  Donald Trump says, let's let Russia back into the G7. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=620.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is reportedly preparing right now for his own big in-person summit with Vladimir Putin. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=624.4s)]
*  Donald Trump already started high-level meetings between the Russian and US governments. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=631.8000000000001s)]
*  Including an inexplicable three and a half hour meeting specifically between the president's [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=636.92s)]
*  real estate friend and Vladimir Putin himself. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=643.96s)]
*  Steve Witkoff came back from that meeting and how'd that go? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=648.44s)]
*  Went pretty well for someone. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=653.76s)]
*  Headline, parroting Putin and Trump, Witkoff says Russia was provoked into invading Ukraine. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=655.4s)]
*  Headline, Trump envoy can't name a single concession Russia will make in peace deal. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=661.12s)]
*  What does it seem like is going on here? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=670.12s)]
*  Imagine if a foreign adversary, imagine if the Putin government somehow could just do [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=675.0s)]
*  a thought experiment. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=682.12s)]
*  Imagine they could somehow exert control or influence over the government of the United States. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=683.4s)]
*  What do you think the Putin government would have the US government do if he could control it? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=692.44s)]
*  What kind of headlines would you expect to see about the operations of our government [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=698.08s)]
*  under that kind of a scenario? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=703.0s)]
*  And what would you expect the news out of the Oval Office and the White House to look [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=706.32s)]
*  like on a day like today? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn9BTALjtLY&t=710.4s)]
