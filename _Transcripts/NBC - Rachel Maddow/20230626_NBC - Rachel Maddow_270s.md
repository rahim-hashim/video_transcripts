# 'This is some really powerful evidence': McQuade assesses the Trump Bedminster tape
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [June 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg)
*  Joining us now is Barbara McQuade, former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=0.0s)]
*  She's a professor at the University of Michigan School of Law. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=3.6s)]
*  Barbara, thank you very much for being with us tonight. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=6.24s)]
*  I'm so glad we were able to get you here for this story with this late-breaking news. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=8.08s)]
*  Oh, glad to be here, Rachel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=12.32s)]
*  So, let me just get your top-line reaction. We obviously had some of this tape described [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=15.52s)]
*  in the indictment line for line. There were some ellipses in the indictment, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=25.12s)]
*  not every line that's on this tape was reflected in the indictment. It strikes me as potentially [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=28.8s)]
*  important when Trump says explicitly, these are the papers, which would seem to cast no doubt on [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=35.68s)]
*  whether or not he was actually holding papers that he was describing to this writer. But as a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  prosecutor, as a former prosecutor, as a lawyer, how do you hear this as evidence? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=47.92s)]
*  Well, I have two reactions to it. One is, as a former prosecutor, it makes my hair stand on end [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=53.28s)]
*  a little bit to see this in the public domain. Prosecutors try to keep this stuff safeguarded so [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=57.76s)]
*  that you can't have witness tampering and crowdsourcing of defenses now that people [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=62.32s)]
*  can because this is in the public domain. But as a matter of evidence, this is some really [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=68.24s)]
*  powerful evidence. We had seen some verbatim quotes from this recording that was in the indictment, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=72.72s)]
*  but to hear the whole thing play out, I think, is incredible evidence. And at trial, it will not [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=79.44s)]
*  just be this recording that's played in a vacuum. They will have to authenticate this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=85.92s)]
*  recording with someone who was there. So whether it is the biographer or the publisher or one of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=92.08s)]
*  the two staffers, one or more of them will have to be there. And one question I think they'll be [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=97.44s)]
*  asked is, did you look at it? Because it sure sounds like he's showing it to them and they're [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=102.32s)]
*  actually reading it. So I think it proves a couple of things. One, as you said, his knowledge and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=106.48s)]
*  intent, which is important here, about that he is willfully violating the law. And the other is the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=111.76s)]
*  incredible recklessness with which he is treating our national secrets. So it's a very powerful [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  piece of evidence. And, Barb, let me just ask you about one of those points that you just made about [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  the fact that it seems when you hear this back and forth, it seems like the person who he's in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=127.04s)]
*  conversation with is looking at the documents. I mean, I got the sense of I got sort of that as a [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  vague impression from reading it in the indictment, hearing it, that seems much more clear. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=137.68s)]
*  Again, that part of the tape, I have a big pile of papers, this thing just came up. Look, this was [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=143.28s)]
*  him. He's talking about Mark Milley. They presented me this. This is off the record. But they presented [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=147.84s)]
*  me this. This was him. This was the Defense Department and him. And then the person he's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  speaking to, the writer says, wow, as if they are looking at the thing that he is imploring the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=156.72s)]
*  person to look at, this wasn't done by me. This was him. All sorts of stuff, pages long. Look, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=162.64s)]
*  when the writer, the other person in the room says, wow, it does appear that he wasn't just, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=169.2s)]
*  you know, waving it in the distance, showing that papers existed, but rather asking the person to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  view the content of that material. And that does, just as a lay person, makes me wonder why [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=179.76s)]
*  dissemination of classified material wasn't charged. It does seem like they've got evidence [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  that he showed it to at least one other person. Yeah, that's how it lands with me as well. And [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  as we said, I think they're going to call that witness. You know, they got this recording from [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  somebody. My guess is it came through some sort of grand jury subpoena or request from the person [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=202.08s)]
*  who was in the room recording it for the purpose of gathering information for this biography. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=207.12s)]
*  And so certainly it is a separate crime to disclose classified information to a person who [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=211.84s)]
*  is not authorized to receive it. That could be another charge. Now, my guess is this occurred in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=217.36s)]
*  Bedminster, I believe, in New Jersey. And so it would be technically improper to charge it in [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=223.04s)]
*  Florida because there would not be proper venue there. But I know some have suggested perhaps this [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=227.68s)]
*  is a charge prosecutors are keeping in their pocket that could be filed in a separate indictment [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  in the district of New Jersey. So that's one possible theory for that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=237.12s)]
*  Barbara McQuade, invaluable to have you here tonight. Thank you so much, Barbara. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  Let's have some cokes. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=246.0s)]
*  We'll send out for them. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXzc0Agu7Eg&t=249.04s)]
