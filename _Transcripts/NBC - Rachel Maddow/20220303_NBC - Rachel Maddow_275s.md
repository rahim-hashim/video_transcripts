# Tracking The Many Moving Parts In Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo)
*  For all of the latest on Russia's military movements now in Ukraine, I want to bring [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=0.0s)]
*  in Clint Watts, research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and of course MSNBC [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=4.08s)]
*  national security analyst who is at the board for us. Clint, walk us through your readout of [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=8.72s)]
*  this situation, what you're seeing play out in Ukraine militarily. I mean, thanks for having me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=14.56s)]
*  Lots to talk about today. The first thing I think we want to talk about is what's going on [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=19.44s)]
*  in Zaporizhzhia. Right now at the nuclear power plant, everyone's worried about this firefight. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=23.36s)]
*  Earlier it looked like from some of the twitter footage that was there, there was some sort of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=28.8s)]
*  firefight going on there. You could see bullets moving off of the buildings. Very dangerous [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  situation and I think everyone's trying to figure out is this power plant in jeopardy? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=38.0s)]
*  Is the nuclear fuel essentially secured and what's the danger and risk there? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Everyone should probably be asking why does Russia keep focusing on nuclear power plants? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=47.6s)]
*  Remember we were talking about them retaking Chernobyl late last week. There's a few reasons. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=51.84s)]
*  One, they want to be able to control energy inside the country with the Ukrainian population, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=57.76s)]
*  turn it on, turn it off. The second part is psychologically. They use that as fear. Fear [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=62.8s)]
*  is a weapon. That's why we're talking about it right now. We're worried about it but also [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=67.36s)]
*  they can use that to create disinformation, misinformation at home, scare their population. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=71.2s)]
*  And the third thing which I don't think has been talked about enough is logistics. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  Nearly all nuclear power plants have a rail head. When you have a large armored divisions [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=80.24s)]
*  and you have very weak supply lines, it's always great to get a hold of rail heads because if you [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=85.44s)]
*  do you can move your armor around without consuming so much fuel and moving so slowly. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=89.92s)]
*  Let's take a step back though on other developments today that are super important. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=95.28s)]
*  We've been talking a lot about the convoy in the north in Kiev. Russia hasn't done very well a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=100.0s)]
*  week and a day in but now what you're seeing them do is take control in the south. Several [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=104.72s)]
*  developments. These units here in Crimea, Crimea was taken over in 2014, they busted out and created [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=109.28s)]
*  a land bridge all the way to Mariupol which you were showing right there. Mariupol has been laid [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=116.0s)]
*  siege. This is siege warfare. This is the kind of stuff we saw in Aleppo and Grozny from the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=121.12s)]
*  Russian army. Total and total complete devastation using indirect fires knocking out all infrastructure. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=126.32s)]
*  This could be a forecast of what the Russians want to do in Kiev. Separately and very importantly, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=133.12s)]
*  from the same area they have moved to Khursan. Khursan is one of the bridges that goes over the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=138.4s)]
*  Dnieper river. The Dnieper river flowing in from the Black Sea all the way up through the center [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=144.72s)]
*  of Ukraine is a major artery and if they can get through and over to that western side they then [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=149.52s)]
*  have the ability to move all the way to the Moldovan border essentially sealing off southern Ukraine and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=154.72s)]
*  all of the port access which would allow them if they wanted to to start landing military force [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=160.32s)]
*  in places in and around Odessa essentially creating a southern front. Let's jump to the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=165.52s)]
*  big picture real quick to finish off which is what this strategy is. Their original strategy was what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=170.56s)]
*  I call three fronts and a coup. They were trying to come in in three directions. One from here, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=176.0s)]
*  one from here. Neither of these went really well. Here in the south they're starting to break through [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=182.4s)]
*  but their original gamble was to do essentially a political coup in combination with airborne [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=187.28s)]
*  raids and an assassination essentially of President Zelensky. That has failed. However, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=191.92s)]
*  if you watch what they're doing today and listening to press secretary Kirby from the defense [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=196.72s)]
*  department what you're seeing them do is extend out this in-lodgement here all the way back up [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=200.88s)]
*  here to the Belorussian border. That convoy which has been sitting there that is logistical supply [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=205.92s)]
*  that they're trying to build up. They need to secure the rear area by destroying these population [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=211.04s)]
*  centers. They don't want to have an insurgency in their supply lines. From here on out it's a really [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=216.16s)]
*  battle of logistics. We always say food, fuel, and ammunition and it's going to be can the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=220.96s)]
*  Russians do food, fuel, and ammunition and can the Ukrainians sustain food, fuel, and ammunition. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=226.08s)]
*  I think from here on out it's really a battle of logistics and who can last and who cannot. I think [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=231.28s)]
*  the last part I would want to say is they're going to try and do a siege around Kiev. They can bring [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  forces up from the south and link them in and then seal off to the west. That's essentially if you've [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=240.72000000000003s)]
*  lost the sea and you're in Ukraine your supply lines are over vast land distances from the west [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=245.92s)]
*  and have to come in through the border areas around Poland. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7sS358Ubo&t=251.76s)]
