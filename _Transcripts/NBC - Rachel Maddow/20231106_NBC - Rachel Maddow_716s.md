# UAW president defies skeptics (including Trump) to negotiate historic deal for union workers
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk)
*  Americans have a favorable view of labor unions by a huge margin right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=0.0s)]
*  71% support. That's higher than at any time in my lifetime. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=6.48s)]
*  That is higher than at any time since the 1960s. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=10.8s)]
*  And unions have had this bunch of great successes within the past year. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=15.52s)]
*  UPS workers who are part of the Teamsters, academic workers, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=20.8s)]
*  tens of thousands of health care workers at Kaiser, airline pilots, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  the Writers Guild in Hollywood, all of these big organized labor successes in the past 12 months. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=28.8s)]
*  And now of course the UAW, United Auto Workers. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=35.52s)]
*  A six-week strike against the big three U.S. automakers has brought agreements for what are [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=38.64s)]
*  being called record contracts, a 25% pay raise for auto workers over four and a half years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=43.52s)]
*  Factory work at a Detroit automaker 40 hours a week, $84,000 a year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=50.16s)]
*  Plus cost of living adjustments guaranteed as a protection against inflation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=56.56s)]
*  Now these are all tentative agreements with the big three automakers. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=62.56s)]
*  UAW locals still have to ratify the results. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=65.76s)]
*  But the terms the union won in this strike are so favorable that when they were announced, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=68.88s)]
*  Toyota, which isn't union, unexpectedly announced a surprise increase in its own wages for its own [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  non-union employees, presumably to try to preempt them all wanting to join the union now, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=83.44s)]
*  to get the same kind of deal that UAW was just able to get for its members at Ford and GM and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=88.56s)]
*  Stellantis. The UAW strike was audacious, it was pushy, it was a huge success. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=94.88s)]
*  UAW's President Sean Fain said, if the automakers have record profits, which they do, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=105.12s)]
*  then we should have record contracts. And now they do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=110.08s)]
*  Just watch this. You can tell from the way they are messaging on this, from the very beginning [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=115.36s)]
*  of this strike, you can tell that part of the wind in their sails here is that they know the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  kind of support they have from the American public. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=126.56s)]
*  And I see a working class that is fed up and fired up. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=140.08s)]
*  I see working class people from all walks of life standing together. You all know what we need to do [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  and now the whole world knows what we need to do. When they tell us to sit down, we stand up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  You may have recognized some Democratic politicians in that footage from UAW. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=165.12s)]
*  It's recognizable folks here. Senator Sanders here, Congressman Dingell, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=169.68s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries you see there. This was all put out before the leader of the Democratic party, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=173.92s)]
*  the sitting president of the United States, made history by being the first sitting president in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=179.28s)]
*  the history of the United States to join union workers on a picket line. First time that's ever [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=184.16s)]
*  happened in American history. President Joe Biden made history that way. In the midst of this strike, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=188.88s)]
*  while his likely opponent next year, Donald Trump, instead went out and said that the UAW was selling [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=196.0s)]
*  auto workers down the tubes, he said to UAW members, quote, I don't think you're picketing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=202.08s)]
*  for the right thing. He said, members of the UAW should stop paying their dues. This was his [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=208.0s)]
*  contribution. And then the UAW got record contracts from all three Detroit automakers [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  with massive support from the American people. Basically the whole country cheering them on [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=219.68s)]
*  with President Biden making history to step out and support them in a way no president has ever [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=225.68s)]
*  done before. And then they won bigger than anybody thought they could. In this supposedly [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=230.08s)]
*  fatally polarized country where we can't agree on anything, the country all basically agrees on this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=236.16s)]
*  They did it. Joining us now is Sean Fain, president of the United Auto Workers. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=242.56s)]
*  Mr. Fain, congratulations on the success of these recent labor actions and thanks very much for being [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  with us tonight. Well, thank you for having me, Rachel. It's great to be here. Let me just ask if [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=251.6s)]
*  I've described the strategy here correctly, describing it correctly as an innovation and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  did I get it right in terms of the way it was designed to sort of calibrate the effect you were [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=262.08s)]
*  looking for? You bet. Basically it was harnessing the power of the membership. And think about this, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=266.32s)]
*  I've only been in office for seven months. So we had in a very short order, we had to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=274.48s)]
*  try to do everything we could do to be prepared for bargaining. We ran for the first time in our [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  history a contract campaign to get our membership prepared so that in the event we had to take [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=283.44s)]
*  action, they would know what the issues were, they would know why they're out there and what [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=288.32s)]
*  we're fighting for. And then the next step was, we did a lot of, for the first time unprecedented [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  in this union was our transparency and communication with the membership, doing Facebook Lives weekly, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=300.24s)]
*  communicating with the members, keeping them updated what's going on at the bargaining table [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=305.52s)]
*  and out in other areas. Seeing our members hold rallies and just do action leading up to this, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=310.08s)]
*  it gave us immense power at the bargaining table. And the company saw that we had a unified union. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=316.08s)]
*  In the past, there was always two sets of people, the membership on the floor and the leadership in [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=321.76s)]
*  Detroit. And it's not that way anymore. We're one unit, we're unified. And this is what happens when [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=327.44s)]
*  everyone gets together and they're unified in their approach and we had great success with it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=333.68s)]
*  What do you think about how important it is that there's so much public support right now [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=338.24s)]
*  for the union movement for organized labor? I mean, over the course of my lifetime, we've seen [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=344.72s)]
*  wild fluctuations in the number of Americans who are in organized labor, who are in unions themselves. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=351.44s)]
*  You know, the UAW at one point was one and a half million people. Now it's closer to 400,000. We've [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=357.92s)]
*  seen big fluctuations, but we also do see this huge amount of support right now in the public. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=363.2s)]
*  How important was that to the success of these actions and to the way you're thinking about how [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=368.32s)]
*  to keep moving forward? Well, I think it's very important. And I think, you know, it's just a sign [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=373.44s)]
*  of the times. You know, in the last 40 years almost, working class people have went backwards [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=378.32s)]
*  continually. Slowly it's migrated and there's this massive chasm between the billionaire class and a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  working class. And, you know, when those things get out of balance, we need to turn it upside down. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=390.32s)]
*  When there's, when 26 billionaires have as much wealth as half of humanity, it's a crisis. And, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=395.2s)]
*  and, you know, it's, it's our issues, whether it's UAW, it's, it's working class issues, whether [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=401.68s)]
*  you're union or not, everyone identifies with what's going on right now. People in unions and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=406.96s)]
*  people, working class people that aren't in unions, you know, are literally scraping to get by. They're [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  working seven days a week, 12 and 16 hours a day, multiple jobs, not to, not to save money, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=417.28s)]
*  just to scrape to get by. And so, you know, it's time. I think it's, it's, it's way past time [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=423.28s)]
*  and it's up to organized labor to lead that movement. And I'm really proud of the work we've [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=429.44s)]
*  done and other unions are doing right now, standing up for the working class. And we've [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  already seen the fruits of that. We negotiated record contracts to big three and within a week [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=437.11999999999995s)]
*  you saw Toyota reduce their progression four years for their employees and give them 9% [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=443.36s)]
*  pay increases. We call that the, the UAW bump. And that's what happens. And when, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=448.32s)]
*  when those people become members of the UAW, they'll get even more. And so that's what this [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=453.2s)]
*  is all about. It's about raising all tides. Let me ask you about that directly. If you have [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=457.76s)]
*  anything you'd like to say tonight here on television to, to Tesla, to Honda, Toyota, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  and other non-union car companies that are making cars in the United States, as you mentioned, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=468.16s)]
*  Toyota seems to have given a UAW bump to their non-UAW member, the workers, presumably to try [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=473.04s)]
*  to preempt any enthusiasm among Toyota workers to try to get the same deal by joining UAW. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=480.48s)]
*  But do you have anything you'd like to say to those car makers right now in terms of what happened, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=485.36s)]
*  what's going to happen here next? Well, I look, I look at the migration of my grandparents back [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=488.32000000000005s)]
*  in the thirties and forties from the South, you know, where coming out of a depression, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=492.64000000000004s)]
*  they moved North to union jobs and it changed their lives. And we're getting back to setting [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=496.16s)]
*  that standard now. And so, you know, we've had throughout this process, because of the energy [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  that's around this campaign, literally we've had hundreds, daily hundreds of workers from, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=505.76000000000005s)]
*  from all over the South, all these non-union companies reach out to us about organizing. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=510.56s)]
*  They want, they want a piece of this. And that was, that's the comparison I look at with my [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=515.36s)]
*  grandparents generation was they saw a better way of life and we set the standard. Now we're back [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  to setting the standard again. People want to be a part of that. So, you know, we're reaching out [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=523.76s)]
*  to members and we are in the process of planning our next steps for organizing. We've revamped our [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  organizing department and we are locked and loaded and we're coming for them. You know, those workers [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=533.52s)]
*  at Tesla, Hyundai, Nissan, anywhere at Toyota, they're no different than us. You know, working [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  class people, we all have the same issues. You know, we want to have a wage where we can have [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=543.92s)]
*  a sustainable life, you know, not just live to work, but, but, you know, work to have a good living. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=548.88s)]
*  And, and it's went too far gone the other way in the past. So, you know, I really believe we're [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=553.92s)]
*  going to have a lot of success and I believe those members want to join the union. I think they'll, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=560.24s)]
*  once they do and they, they step aside from the fear tactics and the scare taxes these [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=563.68s)]
*  companies will employ upon them. When they see that benefit, there's no going back. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=567.68s)]
*  One last question for you. I mentioned that the very visible support that you got from President [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=573.36s)]
*  Biden, it's historic for a sitting president to have done that. Have you had substantive support [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=577.76s)]
*  behind the scenes personally from President Biden and from his administration? And is this likely to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=584.0s)]
*  lead to a UAW endorsement for President Biden? Well, as we've said from the outset, you know, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  our endorsements are going to be earned, not freely given. And, you know, our membership right [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=594.8s)]
*  now, the focus right now is on, on the agreements and that's been our 100% laser focus is on our [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=598.88s)]
*  contracts. So the membership right now, the focus is getting them all the information they can around [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=603.84s)]
*  the contract and, and let them make a good, you know, it's, it's up to them to vote in the next [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=608.32s)]
*  few weeks. And, you know, we'll address politics when it's time to do that. I will say this, you [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=613.12s)]
*  know, there's a distinct difference in the two candidates, the two leading candidates, you know, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=618.96s)]
*  for the first time in our history of this country, a president visited the picket line. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=624.08s)]
*  That says a lot. The other candidate chose to go to a non-union factory that has nothing to do with, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLWeQJuVHfk&t=628.96s)]
