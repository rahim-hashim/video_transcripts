# Means Of Sustaining Life In Mariupol Dwindle For Those Unable To Flee Russian Bombing
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 21, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0)
*  Joining us now is Belka Zvila, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=0.0s)]
*  Ms. Zvila, thank you so much for being here and thank you so much for bearing witness by bringing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  us these accounts. They are devastating. I'm trying to get a sense from these people who [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=10.96s)]
*  you've talked to who are out of Mariupol what life must be like for those who are inside and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=16.8s)]
*  for whom we cannot bear witness right now. Absolutely. I mean the people we spoke to [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=21.84s)]
*  are the lucky few. They're people who had personal vehicles and were able to actually make it out of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=26.88s)]
*  the city. Humanitarian corridors have broken down time and again and so you haven't seen an [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=32.8s)]
*  organized full-scale evacuation that's allowed the majority of the population out. Everyone we spoke [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  to had been sheltering in basements with dozens of other people who stayed behind because they [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  didn't have cars and they didn't have a way out and as you said you know they described to us [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  flushing out their heating systems to get access to water, you know going to springs, melting snow [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=56.24s)]
*  and the people we spoke to all said that food stocks were really dwindling when they left [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=63.84s)]
*  other people behind in the basements they had been sheltering in. You wonder when this is going to [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=69.76s)]
*  end and you hope it's going to be better but in Mariupol we have a situation in which there's not [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=74.56s)]
*  the availability of water and it is winter and people don't have heating. They don't have power. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=78.08s)]
*  We've met people who say they can't be in touch with their relatives who are back in Mariupol [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=83.52s)]
*  because there's no cell service. You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't if you're [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=87.84s)]
*  in Mariupol. Absolutely and I think the point that you make about those left behind and how [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  they're affected particularly by the lack of electricity is significant. For those people [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=98.72s)]
*  that we interviewed most of them before they made it out spent two weeks hiding in basements and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=104.8s)]
*  sheltering from this ongoing shelling all around them just hoping that they wouldn't be injured [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=111.6s)]
*  and they you know eventually would be able to make it out. The most haunting stories that I heard were [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=117.6s)]
*  actually from older people and people with disabilities. For these people they couldn't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  make it down to the basement so they were in their apartment buildings. I spoke to a man in his 80s [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=129.28s)]
*  who was on his six-floor apartment. Another couple who were in a third floor apartment [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=134.64s)]
*  and for them there was no way down and they described to me how they essentially spent those [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  two weeks sitting on their couch in a room with blown out windows so nothing blocking the cold [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=146.32s)]
*  outside. As you said it was below zero degrees celsius and they were sitting there freezing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  and they were just watching the bombs and the explosions going off outside of their windows [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=159.6s)]
*  absolutely terrified that any moment would be their last. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6VDDNZZOl0&t=165.2s)]
