# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Jan. 31
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA)
*  I'm going to show you a little local news report from Orlando, Florida this weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm just going to warn you right up front that some of the images and the speech in [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=4.32s)]
*  this clip are gross and they could be upsetting. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=7.16s)]
*  This contains some anti-Semitic and white supremacist blather that you might not want [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  to hear or you might not want your kids to hear if you're watching with any kids. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=17.04s)]
*  So that is your fair warning if you do not want to hear it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=19.68s)]
*  But the reason I'm going to show it, even just a few seconds of it, is that it does [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=23.04s)]
*  us no good to pretend that this isn't happening. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=27.44s)]
*  And if you take a look at just a little bit of this, you will understand why the citizens [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  of Orlando, Florida may be a little shaken up today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=33.88s)]
*  This is from News 6 Orlando. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=37.34s)]
*  Men and women with neo-Nazi armbands, flags and posters stood on the corner of this Waterford [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=43.36s)]
*  Lakes intersection on Saturday, shouting words of white supremacist hate. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  Orange County Sheriff's deputies confirm this video is part of their active and open [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=52.48s)]
*  investigation into the demonstration. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=56.599999999999994s)]
*  And this part of the video, a fight in the street, investigators say, involved the demonstrators [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=59.36s)]
*  and a passerby. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=64.34s)]
*  Also over the weekend, troopers broke up this demonstration of hate on an I-4 overpass in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=66.22s)]
*  Orlando telling News 6 it's illegal to obstruct traffic or hang signs on overpasses. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  So that's two overt Nazi gatherings on two successive days this weekend out in broad [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=78.32s)]
*  daylight in central Florida at the shopping center, over the highway, just out harassing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=84.38s)]
*  the locals. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=90.3s)]
*  I'm just going to show you a tiny bit more of that video that's part of the investigation [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=91.3s)]
*  by the Orange County Sheriff now in Florida. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  Because with this bit that I'm going to show you, you can get a sense of the way they were [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  going after the locals and innocent bystanders trying to free people out, trying to provoke [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=102.82s)]
*  people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=107.6s)]
*  This is just a few seconds again, but I will warn you that it is it is a little gross. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=108.6s)]
*  You know, this is what he did. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  You get some back power, you get some back power. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  Right power. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  Is it you? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=125.91999999999999s)]
*  Guess where you're going back to. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  Believe it or not, we actually carefully cut that to show you the least vulgar excerpt [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=132.72s)]
*  we could find from that tape. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=138.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=139.92s)]
*  It still makes you makes your skin crawl. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=140.92s)]
*  I will also just note that when that Nazi groups took to the highway overpasses yesterday [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=144.12s)]
*  on one of them right next to the swastika banner, they draped a banner that said, let's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=149.88s)]
*  go Brandon, except because except because they're exactly the geniuses you think they [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=155.04s)]
*  are. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=159.28s)]
*  They misspelled the word Brandon. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=160.28s)]
*  Like that's a hard one. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=162.4s)]
*  Why were they saying, let's go, Brandon? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  If you are unfamiliar, that phrase is a like Google kind of code among the pro Trump crowd [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=166.36s)]
*  for F. Joe Biden. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  It's become a rallying cry for pro Trump folks all over the country and even for Republican [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=174.36s)]
*  elected officials. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=179.06s)]
*  For whatever reason, this particular group of Nazis feel like that's the right message, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=181.36s)]
*  along with all the kill the Jews stuff. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=185.44s)]
*  And for whatever reason, they believe this is the right moment to go out and gather in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=188.14s)]
*  broad daylight in suburban Orlando, Florida. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  Joining us now is Florida State Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=195.89999999999998s)]
*  His district includes the area where this Nazi group gathered on Saturday. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=198.89999999999998s)]
*  He said yesterday online, quote, hatred and anti-Semitism have no place in our community. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=202.73999999999998s)]
*  I'm appalled to see Nazis rallying in the East Orlando district I represent. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=207.77999999999997s)]
*  They are never welcome here. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  Representative Smith, I appreciate you taking the time to be here tonight. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=215.17999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=217.42s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=218.42s)]
*  First, I'm sorry that this happened in your district. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=221.38s)]
*  It is a at least at least at some level, it is a terrorizing thing for people to come [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=224.54s)]
*  up against this on the street corner, even on the local news on their commute to work [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=231.5s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=235.22s)]
*  Let me just ask how your constituents are reacting. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=236.64s)]
*  What the community reaction has been? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=239.62s)]
*  Well, folks in the East Orlando based district that I represent near the University of Central [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=244.34s)]
*  Florida were appalled. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=248.5s)]
*  I remember getting tagged and getting texts and getting posts on my social media feed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=250.02s)]
*  that it was happening in Waterford Lakes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=257.86s)]
*  It's a place that I am very familiar with. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=260.02s)]
*  It's near my East Orlando home. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=263.62s)]
*  And folks were really alarmed and scared that this was actually happening in their community. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=266.98s)]
*  And like I said before, in my social media post that you read, this type of hatred and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=273.54s)]
*  anti-Semitism is not welcome here in Orlando. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=278.98s)]
*  Orlando is a really diverse community that is an inclusive community, that is an accepting [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=281.38s)]
*  community. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=287.54s)]
*  And these neo-Nazis that were rallying around Orlando, they don't represent who we are. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=288.58s)]
*  But it's not just those of us here in Orlando that should be concerned and alarmed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=294.1s)]
*  All Floridians should be concerned because we're seeing a rise of extremism and white [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=299.78s)]
*  supremacy in our state. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=305.78s)]
*  And we all have to understand that that didn't happen here overnight. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=307.38s)]
*  According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Florida is number two in the nation for the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=311.46s)]
*  number of hate groups that are based in our state. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  And that number is growing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=321.7s)]
*  We also know that, unfortunately, there were more Floridians that were arrested and that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  are seeing charges brought against them who were involved in the violent insurrection [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=329.22s)]
*  on January 6th in the nation's capital. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=335.14000000000004s)]
*  And many of those individuals were tied to some of these hate groups like the Proud Boys. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=338.1s)]
*  And so it's really incumbent on folks to speak out, to denounce this type of hatred and bigotry, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=344.02000000000004s)]
*  and really just kind of be aware and open their eyes to this rise of extremist and hateful [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=350.82000000000005s)]
*  behavior in our area. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=357.94000000000005s)]
*  Were any of these groups at all recognizable to you? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=360.02000000000004s)]
*  Or are these, I mean, has there been previous white supremacist activity like this in your [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=363.54s)]
*  district? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=368.26000000000005s)]
*  Is there any sense in which these guys were sort of usual suspects for this sort of thing? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=369.62s)]
*  Or was this a surprise? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=373.38000000000005s)]
*  And were these strangers? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=375.3s)]
*  Well, we understand that one of the groups that was involved, one of their leaders is based in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=380.18s)]
*  Kissimmee, which is just around the corner from the East Orlando district that I represent. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=386.18s)]
*  We also saw in South Florida some leaflets and some papers, some anti-Semitic [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=391.54s)]
*  documents and flyers that were being left in our communities that were promoting the same [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=396.98s)]
*  hateful message. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=405.14s)]
*  But I think what's important to contextualize here is what are we doing in our state that [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=407.14s)]
*  is potentially affecting the rise in hatred and extremism in Florida? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=415.14s)]
*  Our legislature right now is actively considering proposals pushed by Governor DeSantis to, for [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=421.38s)]
*  example, shield Floridians from discomfort or guilt by censoring conversations about race, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=428.18s)]
*  about LGBTQ identities in our schools and in our workplaces. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=435.38s)]
*  Somehow, some of these extremists and white supremacists are getting the message that it is [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=441.38s)]
*  okay for them to be public with their hatred and anti-Semitism, that they should come out of the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=448.26s)]
*  shadows because we're seeing this rise in extremism. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=454.9s)]
*  And it's incumbent upon all elected officials, Republican and Democrat, to unequivocally condemn [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=459.21999999999997s)]
*  this type of hatred and ask why are individuals feeling empowered, these neo-Nazis, to come out [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=467.46s)]
*  from the shadows and why has Florida become such a haven for anti-Semitic extremists and white [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=476.58s)]
*  supremacists? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=482.5s)]
*  Florida State Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=484.5s)]
*  Representative Smith, I appreciate you being here tonight. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=487.78s)]
*  Again, I am sorry that this has happened in your district. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=489.85999999999996s)]
*  It's a pleasure to have you here, to have you able to speak out about it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=492.26s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=494.97999999999996s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=496.41999999999996s)]
*  And I would also encourage your viewers who want to beat back against this type of hatred and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=497.21999999999997s)]
*  anti-Semitism to donate to the Holocaust Center of Central Florida because we think that education [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=501.78s)]
*  is such an important part of combating this type of hatred. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=507.85999999999996s)]
*  Also a good point in that it will absolutely drive crazy those guys who showed up in Orlando [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=512.5799999999999s)]
*  today to know that anybody outraged by them isn't just outraged and scared but is actively [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=517.6999999999999s)]
*  contributing to a cause like that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=521.9399999999999s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=524.4200000000001s)]
*  Much appreciated. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=524.98s)]
*  I have one other announcement before we get underway tonight. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=526.74s)]
*  A couple of years ago, you may remember, I did a podcast, a relatively short seven-episode [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=530.98s)]
*  single-arch podcast called Bag Man. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=538.1s)]
*  And it was about Nixon's vice president, Spiro Agnew, and him renting a bribery and extortion [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=541.7s)]
*  ring out of the White House. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=547.62s)]
*  These young federal prosecutors in Maryland basically stumbled onto the evidence of him [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=549.14s)]
*  being a crook and literally taking envelopes of cash across his desk while being a public official. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=554.26s)]
*  They put together this criminal case against him even though he was the sitting vice president. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=561.14s)]
*  And it was all right in the middle of Watergate. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=565.38s)]
*  It was only thanks to those prosecutors that we didn't end up with President Agnew [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=567.38s)]
*  when Nixon resigned in disgrace. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=573.54s)]
*  It would have been after the national trauma and disgrace of Watergate, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=575.54s)]
*  it would next have been President Agnew, the felon, presumably taking envelopes full of cash [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=580.58s)]
*  in the Oval Office instead of in his vice presidential office. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=586.74s)]
*  Had these prosecutors not followed their case to the end and forced Agnew to resign, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=590.58s)]
*  that is what would have happened. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=595.14s)]
*  I still think it's just an absolutely amazing story. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=596.34s)]
*  It also turns out to be the very surprising origin story of why the Justice Department [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=598.98s)]
*  thinks a sitting president can't be criminally indicted even if he definitely commits terrible [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=605.86s)]
*  crimes while he is in office. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=611.62s)]
*  That of course was put to the test like never before under the twice impeached coup plotting [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=613.62s)]
*  President Donald Trump who we just had. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=620.42s)]
*  But where that whole construct came from that you can't indict a sitting president, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=622.42s)]
*  that actually came from the Spiro-Agnew nightmare in the 1970s. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=625.7s)]
*  Anyway, I'm still fascinated by the story. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=630.34s)]
*  I've actually learned a lot more and discovered a lot more about Agnew and that whole period [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=634.42s)]
*  of history since we launched that podcast. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=637.9399999999999s)]
*  The reason I'm telling you this is because it's now going to be a movie. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=640.9799999999999s)]
*  Ben Stiller is going to direct it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=645.38s)]
*  He's incredible. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=646.9799999999999s)]
*  One of the producers of the film is Lorne Michaels. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=648.26s)]
*  Yes, that Lorne Michaels. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=650.5s)]
*  This has been in the works for a while now, but it looks like it's going to happen. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=652.5799999999999s)]
*  I am super excited about it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=657.78s)]
*  And I am going to take a little bit of time off from this show to go help with the movie. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=660.98s)]
*  And also to work on some other things that I have cooking with NBC right now, including [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=667.9399999999999s)]
*  a new podcast kind of along the lines of Bagman and the Spiro-Agnew story. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=673.22s)]
*  It's on a totally different topic, but when I say along the same lines, I mean to say it's [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=678.98s)]
*  got a specific arc. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=685.14s)]
*  It's a specific story. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=686.18s)]
*  It's a reported journalistic tale. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=687.06s)]
*  It's not just like a jibber-jabber podcast where I chat with people and admit I haven't [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=688.98s)]
*  done the reading. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=693.38s)]
*  It's a real thing on a story that I've been starting to research and report for the last [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=694.02s)]
*  few months now. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=698.9s)]
*  I am super excited about it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=699.62s)]
*  Super excited to tell you about it when I have more to tell. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=701.3s)]
*  So just like late night hosts sometimes go on hiatus in their shows, I am going to go [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=705.06s)]
*  on hiatus for a little bit here from this show so I can work on some of those other projects. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=710.9s)]
*  In addition to the movie, the Bagman movie and the podcast that I'm working on, the paperback [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=715.3000000000001s)]
*  of the Bagman book is also coming out in just a few weeks. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=721.3000000000001s)]
*  It's coming out in April. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=724.4200000000001s)]
*  There's also an adaptation of a different book that I want to try to make for TV as [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=726.1s)]
*  well that I've just started working on. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=730.5s)]
*  There's all this stuff I've been working on that I want to work some more on. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=731.7800000000001s)]
*  So as you can tell, I'm nervous about all this. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=735.86s)]
*  It's a change in my life, but it's all for the good. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=740.5s)]
*  I will be here this week through Thursday of this week, and then the hiatus means I'm [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=743.22s)]
*  just going to be off for a few weeks, off from doing the show. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=748.34s)]
*  I'm not really going anywhere. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=750.34s)]
*  I'll be back for the State of the Union and for other big news events in the meantime. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=751.7s)]
*  I will also be back doing the show again before you'll even miss me. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=756.26s)]
*  I'll be back in April. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=759.46s)]
*  And there may eventually be another hiatus again sometime in my future, but for now, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=761.22s)]
*  we're just taking it one step at a time. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=766.5s)]
*  Again, I'll be here through Thursday this week, and then I'm going to have a few weeks [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=768.26s)]
*  off. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=771.22s)]
*  And of course, while I'm away, the show will continue to be run by the absolute best [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=772.28s)]
*  producers in this entire business, by the amazing staff of this show. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=776.76s)]
*  So don't worry. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=780.6s)]
*  You will be in very, very good hands. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=781.64s)]
*  Change is good. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=786.2s)]
*  Change is absolutely terrifying. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=787.08s)]
*  But in this case, it's good. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=789.88s)]
*  So now you know. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=791.8000000000001s)]
*  Let's never speak of this again. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=793.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=795.08s)]
*  District Attorney Willis has convened a special grant or is convening a special grand jury [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=795.74s)]
*  to consider the particulars of that case. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=802.14s)]
*  And she has now called for backup in terms of her security. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=805.4200000000001s)]
*  She's written a letter to the special agents in charge of the FBI, the FBI's Atlanta field [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=808.7800000000001s)]
*  office, because of new concerns for the safety, not just of her team and the prosecutor's office, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=813.6600000000001s)]
*  but of everybody that's even just physically close to her investigation. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=819.1s)]
*  The letter says in part, quote, I have an obligation to ensure that those who work in [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=823.18s)]
*  and visit the Fulton County courthouse, the adjoining Fulton County Government Center [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=828.2199999999999s)]
*  and the surrounding areas are safe in close proximity to the courthouse are the Georgia [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=832.54s)]
*  State Capitol, Atlanta City Hall, federal courthouses and Georgia State University, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=836.6999999999999s)]
*  including student dormitories. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=840.9399999999999s)]
*  Security concerns were escalated this weekend by the rhetoric of former President Trump at [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=842.62s)]
*  a public event in Conroe, Texas. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=847.42s)]
*  Specifically, President Trump said, quote, if these radical, vicious, racist prosecutors [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=849.74s)]
*  do anything wrong or illegal, I hope we're going to have in this country the biggest [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=855.3399999999999s)]
*  protests we've ever had in Washington, D.C., in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere, because [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=859.26s)]
*  our country and our elections are corrupt. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=864.9399999999999s)]
*  Willis continues in her letter, quote, this rhetoric is more alarming in light of his [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=868.78s)]
*  statements at the same event regarding those convicted of crimes, including violence for [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=872.4599999999999s)]
*  actions at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=876.14s)]
*  He stated that if elected president in 2024, he may pardon people who've been convicted [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=879.02s)]
*  of crimes related to the illegal acts at the U.S. Capitol that day. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=883.74s)]
*  And then she makes this very direct ask of the FBI, quote, I am asking that you immediately [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=888.54s)]
*  conduct a risk assessment of the Fulton County Courthouse and Government Center and that [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=892.78s)]
*  you provide protective resources to include intelligence and federal agents. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=897.66s)]
*  Quote, it is imperative that these resources are in place well in advance of the convening [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=902.62s)]
*  of the special purpose grand jury on May 2nd, 2022. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=906.78s)]
*  So this is the district attorney of Fulton County, Georgia, who has opened an investigation [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=912.4599999999999s)]
*  into whether state laws were broken when the president pressured state officials in [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=917.5799999999999s)]
*  Georgia to try to overturn, falsify the election results in that state. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=921.5799999999999s)]
*  This is her asking the FBI for assistance, including federal agents, to protect her and [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=925.1s)]
*  her staff during their investigation of President Trump. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=930.4599999999999s)]
*  That's where we are. And that is a heck of a picture of where our democracy is at and [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=933.74s)]
*  where the de facto leader of the Republican Party is leading the country. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=939.66s)]
*  But here's a practical question. What can the FBI actually do here? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=944.0600000000001s)]
*  Are they the right agency to ask for help? And what are they likely to do in response? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=947.26s)]
*  Joining us now is my friend Chuck Rosenberg. He is a former senior Justice Department official [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=952.46s)]
*  and former senior FBI official. He knows these things. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=956.22s)]
*  Chuck, it's great to see you. Thank you for being here tonight. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=959.34s)]
*  It's my pleasure, Rachel. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=961.34s)]
*  Is this letter addressed to the right entity? Is the FBI the right agency to assess this kind [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=966.46s)]
*  of perceived threat from the DA's office and potentially to provide help? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=974.62s)]
*  Partly no, and mostly yes. So let me explain that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=979.58s)]
*  The FBI isn't in the business of securing courthouses or other facilities. They don't [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=983.5s)]
*  harden buildings. It's not their expertise. And I assume District Attorney Willis knows that. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=988.62s)]
*  There's another interesting fact, Rachel, which is that this letter was public. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=994.78s)]
*  I imagine the press may have received it before the FBI did. And in all my time in government, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=999.34s)]
*  if I needed something from another US attorney elsewhere in the country or a chief or a sheriff [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1004.22s)]
*  in my jurisdiction, I would never write a letter. I would pick up the phone and call, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1009.42s)]
*  and I would expect them to call me. But she wrote a letter, so she very clearly wanted to make it [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1014.54s)]
*  public that she was asking for help. Let me tell you the mostly yes answer to the question. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1019.1s)]
*  Throughout the country, including in Atlanta, the FBI leads joint terrorism task forces. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1025.5s)]
*  Sitting on these JTTFs, including in Atlanta, I suspect, are the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1031.66s)]
*  the Atlanta PD, the Fulton County Sheriff's Office, and all of their state and local partners. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1037.82s)]
*  Together, as part of a JTTF, they can certainly provide to the district attorney what she needs. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1043.98s)]
*  They can advise her about hardening the facility or securing the courthouse. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1050.06s)]
*  They can give her intel from their own holdings. They can search their own holdings. They can query [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1054.38s)]
*  or task their informants. And so it's a very good, thoughtful, public way for the district attorney [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1059.9s)]
*  to say, I think I need help. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1066.38s)]
*  And Chuck, I was struck in the way that she phrased the request. She explicitly mentions [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1070.7s)]
*  President Trump promising pardons to people convicted even of violent events around the January [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1077.42s)]
*  6th attack on the Capitol. She's connecting the threat posed by Trump calling for his supporters [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1083.8200000000002s)]
*  to get in the streets if there is an indictment, essentially, and casting the aspersions that he [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1092.78s)]
*  cast on all the various prosecutors that are looking at him. She's drawing a connection [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1098.46s)]
*  between that threat and the fact that he's promising pardons for people who have committed [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1102.3799999999999s)]
*  violent acts on his behalf in the past. I wondered if you could just, with your law [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1106.54s)]
*  enforcement and your FBI experience, your Justice Department experience, if you could talk about [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1111.18s)]
*  that nexus, whether that's a fair connection for her to draw and whether that does affect [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1115.26s)]
*  the nature of the threat. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1121.02s)]
*  It is a fair connection for her to draw, and it does affect the nature of the threat. And, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1122.94s)]
*  Rachel, here's why. A defendant, somebody charged with a crime, makes a series of calculations. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1127.34s)]
*  Should I go to trial? Should I plead guilty? If I plead guilty, should I cooperate? They are all [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1134.7s)]
*  looking to minimize their exposure, to mitigate the risk, to undo the harm. And so many defendants, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1139.82s)]
*  most, plead guilty, and many defendants, most, try to cooperate. But if the President of the United [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1147.02s)]
*  States, former, perhaps again, tells you, I got your back, I'm dangling pardons. In fact, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1153.18s)]
*  I've given them out to people who have kept their mouth shut in the past. If a would-be President [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1161.82s)]
*  of the United States dangles a pardon, maybe it changes the calculation of a defendant who would [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1167.42s)]
*  otherwise cooperate. Maybe it changes the behavior of a supporter in the street who might not [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1174.3s)]
*  otherwise commit a crime. So I think this is a pernicious threat. This is a dangerous thing to do, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1180.62s)]
*  not just because it changes the calculations of people who have already been charged with a crime. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1187.02s)]
*  It changes the calculations of people who may not yet have committed a crime. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1193.26s)]
*  Exactly. This pernicious is exactly the right word. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHZUPzoZ9LA&t=1197.02s)]
