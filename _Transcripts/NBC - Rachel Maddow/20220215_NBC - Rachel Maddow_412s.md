# Sandy Hook Families Achieve Major Legal Victory Against Gun Maker
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI)
*  In 2014, some of the Sandy Hook families sued Remington, the manufacturer of the gun that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=0.0s)]
*  killed their children, in a wrongful death lawsuit. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=5.44s)]
*  And that case might sound like a no-brainer, but it really was an extraordinary legal long [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=9.52s)]
*  shot. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=14.72s)]
*  That's because guns are unlike any other consumer product. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=16.04s)]
*  The companies that make them are protected by a federal law that essentially shields [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=19.16s)]
*  gun manufacturers from accountability after their products are used to murder people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=23.16s)]
*  And so to get around that law, the families suing Remington tried out a new legal strategy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=29.42s)]
*  They argued that Remington was improperly marketing their AR-15-style weapon to civilians. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=34.32s)]
*  The families argued that Remington was telling people that a gun built for military-style [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=40.46s)]
*  combat could and should also be used in everyday civilian life. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  And as evidence, they presented these ads, the ones that Remington said would make you [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=50.56s)]
*  a man. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=56.22s)]
*  The ones that were battle-tested, meant for combat, the ones that were, according to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=57.38s)]
*  Remington, good enough for professionals and good enough for you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=61.82s)]
*  Their lawyer used an analogy in court, one that makes their argument incredibly easy [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=67.38s)]
*  to understand. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=72.5s)]
*  Can you imagine Ford Motor Company advertising one of their cars to go run over people? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=75.74000000000001s)]
*  Who would hesitate for a second to hold Ford accountable for that? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=81.48s)]
*  This case has been dragging on for seven years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=86.28s)]
*  And today, Remington agreed to a settlement. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=90.2s)]
*  The company that made the gun that killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=94.56s)]
*  it agreed today to pay the families of those victims $73 million. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=99.64s)]
*  For the families of the victims, though, this lawsuit was never about money. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  It was about accountability. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=110.84s)]
*  It was about getting some semblance of justice after their loved ones, their little children, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=112.72s)]
*  were gunned down. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=118.56s)]
*  And it was also about information. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=120.08s)]
*  As part of any legal proceeding like this one, the parties involved are expected to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=123.18s)]
*  turn over what is called discovery. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  Put simply, discovery is any record or document or communication that could be in any way [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=129.96s)]
*  relevant to the lawsuit. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=134.7s)]
*  And so with this lawsuit, the Sandy Hook families hope to obtain through the discovery [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=136.72s)]
*  process some insight into how these gun companies operate and how they make decisions around [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=141.04s)]
*  marketing their products. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=147.76s)]
*  As a condition of this settlement, the families are allowed to publicize what they learned [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=150.24s)]
*  from the thousands and thousands of documents turned over by Remington over the course of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=154.8s)]
*  this trial. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=159.52s)]
*  These are documents that Remington has fought tooth and nail to keep out of the public eye. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=161.66s)]
*  The families who brought this suit believe that bringing these documents to light will [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=167.68s)]
*  help prevent the next mass shooting. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=171.84s)]
*  One of these families is the Wheeler family. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=175.88s)]
*  Their little boy, Benjamin, was six years old when he was shot and killed at Sandy Hook. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=179.52s)]
*  Today Ben's dad, David Wheeler, talked about how he hopes today's settlement will mean [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=186.0s)]
*  families do not have to do what he and his wife did today. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=191.11999999999998s)]
*  We're standing here because Ben isn't. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=198.64s)]
*  He'd be tall, probably with two-celled brown hair and probably lanky, probably skinny. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=205.6s)]
*  But as Francine said, he's six. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=217.4s)]
*  He's six forever under a granite stone in Newtown Cemetery. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=222.84s)]
*  When you lose a kid at an age like that, six years is not enough time to take all the photographs [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=233.2s)]
*  and videos that you need to last for the rest of your life. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=245.08s)]
*  One of the reasons Ben's not here is because some people made a decision driven by an increased [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=254.72s)]
*  desire for profits and a fear of a shrinking market share to focus their advertising on [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=263.68s)]
*  young men, to sell them their product, the most intentionally lethal consumer product [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=269.92s)]
*  our species has ever devised. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=281.64000000000004s)]
*  Think about this for a second. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  Does Honda market their incredibly powerful open-wheel Formula One race cars to young [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=289.04s)]
*  drivers, inexperienced drivers, and tell them that if they buy the product they'll be able [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=294.72s)]
*  to dominate the public roads and highways? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=300.48s)]
*  Do they do that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=302.8s)]
*  Do the makers of hunting knives and compound bows imply in their advertising to young hunters [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=305.72s)]
*  that they can turn those weapons on other human beings and that buying them and using [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=311.8s)]
*  them will bring them power and glory? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=316.28000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=319.6s)]
*  But that's what the firearms industry did. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=321.48s)]
*  They behaved irresponsibly to make more money and their corporate partners turned the other cheek. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=326.0s)]
*  Today is an example of our system working. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=336.76s)]
*  An example of the process that while lengthy, it makes it clear to the manufacturers of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  that if you want to sell them, you must do it in a reasonable and responsible way. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=348.2s)]
*  And it makes clear to the banks who fund them and the insurance companies that cover them [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=355.0s)]
*  that there will be a steep price for irresponsible behavior. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=359.28s)]
*  Our son Ben didn't behave irresponsibly on December 14th. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=367.84s)]
*  He went to school. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=371.56s)]
*  And now he's gone. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=375.56s)]
*  And we're here because we want to make sure that another father and another mother don't [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=379.24s)]
*  have to stand here a Sunday. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=385.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46v2SO4RukI&t=390.56s)]
