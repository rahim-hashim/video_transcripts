# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Oct. 23
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU)
*  So he was speaker of the House of Representatives and he was absolutely over it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is what he said. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=6.68s)]
*  He said, quote, as you all know, for something like three years and especially the last 19 [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=7.68s)]
*  and a half months, I have been very closely tied to Washington. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=11.64s)]
*  Although I have enjoyed hugely being here with you, ladies and gentlemen, I do have [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=15.68s)]
*  the very great desire for a few days sniffing a different atmosphere. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=20.72s)]
*  This is from the U.S. Speaker of the House at the time, Sam Rayburn, speaking on the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=28.2s)]
*  floor of Congress, August 1941. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  I have a very great desire of sniffing a different atmosphere as opposed to yours, which I am [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=35.48s)]
*  sick of sniffing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=42.12s)]
*  He then just spelled it out even more plainly. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=44.2s)]
*  He said, quote, I am homesick. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=46.04s)]
*  I want to go home tomorrow. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  And his colleagues in the House of Representatives let him. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=52.04s)]
*  They allowed him to go home, to sniff home. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=55.24s)]
*  They voted in a temporary speaker, a speaker pro tem. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=59.08s)]
*  So Mr. Rayburn could go back home for a few days and rest up. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=62.28s)]
*  It happens. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=66.68s)]
*  A quarter century later, in 1966, similar situation. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=67.68s)]
*  Speaker of the House at that time wanted to leave town for a few days. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=71.68s)]
*  He said he wanted to give a speech to the Massachusetts state legislature. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=74.28s)]
*  He said he would have to be away to go do that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=77.8s)]
*  So please vote in a temporary speaker in my absence to take care of business. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=80.36s)]
*  It was no big deal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=85.76s)]
*  People apparently didn't even care that while he was home, supposedly to talk to the state [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=86.76s)]
*  legislature where he turned up in the papers was at the big Boston St. Patrick's Day Parade [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=90.92s)]
*  in South E. So really what he meant to ask for was, hey, do you mind giving us a new [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  speaker for a few days? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=102.2s)]
*  I want to go drink green beer in South Boston. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=103.4s)]
*  He didn't put it that way. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=106.44s)]
*  He asked for a different reason, but it was no big deal. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=108.2s)]
*  It happens. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  1939, Speaker William Bankhead told his colleagues he needed a break because he was, quote, a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  little bit tired. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=117.64s)]
*  They said, OK. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  In 1940, he told his fellow lawmakers that a case of the flu was holding on to him, quote, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  with great tenacity and he needed a few days off to have the flu. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  And yes, for when he was tired and for when he had the flu, we got a temporary speaker [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=131.68s)]
*  of the House. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=136.06s)]
*  It is not uncommon, at least it's not unheard of, to have the U.S. House of Representatives [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  elect a temporary speaker for any number of reasons, even sort of cute reasons, even slightly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=143.54s)]
*  disingenuous reasons about going to parades. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=149.66s)]
*  But now we're looking at a situation where we're getting a speaker pro tem, apparently [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=153.06s)]
*  indefinitely, not because the real speaker is sick, but because the Republican Party [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=157.78s)]
*  is sick and it has no sign of getting better anytime soon. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=163.26s)]
*  Do you notice anything strange in this image? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=170.26s)]
*  This this is not the House, which the Republicans have lost control of themselves and we therefore [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=173.94s)]
*  don't have a working House of Representatives. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  This is the Senate where Democrats are in charge. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=180.85999999999999s)]
*  What do you notice about this picture? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  Look who's on the Foreign Relations Committee in the United States Senate. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=187.18s)]
*  Still, as of today, they took him out of his position as chairman of the Foreign Relations [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=191.7s)]
*  Committee. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=197.61999999999998s)]
*  But look, he is still there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=198.61999999999998s)]
*  While today he was arraigned on a federal felony indictment for allegedly conspiring [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=200.5s)]
*  to work as a foreign agent, as an agent of the Egyptian government. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  He pled not guilty today. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  He released a statement after his plea insisting on his innocence. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=211.66s)]
*  But this is the same U.S. senator who was already recently indicted on federal felony [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  charges of bribery, of conspiracy to commit extortion. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=219.46s)]
*  Now he's charged as an alleged foreign agent. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=222.9s)]
*  And while he is under indictment on those charges, he is continuing to serve on the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=227.26000000000002s)]
*  Senate Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  Like this is normal. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=234.58s)]
*  More than 30 Democratic senators have called on New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez to resign, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  even though he too is a Democrat. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  No Republicans have called on him to resign because presumably that's too awkward for [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=246.14s)]
*  them with their own party's leader indicted on 91 felony charges. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=249.73999999999998s)]
*  But honestly, who cares about whether other people are doing the right thing or the wrong [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=254.42s)]
*  thing? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=258.65999999999997s)]
*  You still have to do the right thing or answer for it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  Democrats control the United States Senate. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=262.82s)]
*  I understand they do not have enough votes to expel Bob Menendez from the Senate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=265.94s)]
*  You need a two-thirds vote to expel a senator. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=270.94s)]
*  It almost never happens. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=273.96s)]
*  It hasn't happened since they expelled Confederates during the Civil War. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=275.1s)]
*  I get that about the issue of expulsion, just the practicalities of it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=278.70000000000005s)]
*  But leaving him on the U.S. Senate's Foreign Relations Committee right now, while he is [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=283.02000000000004s)]
*  on trial as an alleged foreign agent in this world with what we've got going on right now, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=287.66s)]
*  seriously, I honestly just do not know why Democrats don't want to do this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=294.22s)]
*  It would not be hard if they wanted to do it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=298.5s)]
*  If they wanted to kick him off the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, all they'd have [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=301.70000000000005s)]
*  to do is kick him off and put somebody else on in his place. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=304.82s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  I have absolutely no idea why they aren't doing it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=310.21999999999997s)]
*  But so far, they're not. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  I want to start tonight with what feels like it might be an important new stage in the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=317.94s)]
*  war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=323.21999999999997s)]
*  Now we don't want to overstate things. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=325.14s)]
*  I want to be clear that the big picture remains the same. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=327.46s)]
*  Israel, in response to the terrorist attack by Hamas that killed more than a thousand [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=332.62s)]
*  Israeli civilians, has continued its airstrikes inside the densely populated Gaza Strip. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=336.14s)]
*  While there's been so much expectation as to whether Israel is going to launch a ground [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=342.66s)]
*  invasion and when they're going to do that, in the meantime, they have launched these [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=346.94s)]
*  devastating airstrikes day after day after day. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=350.58s)]
*  More than 4,000 people in Gaza are believed to have been killed since the Israeli retaliation [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=353.62s)]
*  for the Hamas terrorist attacks began 17 days ago. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=359.5s)]
*  Civilians cannot leave Gaza still, even including the U.S. citizens who are among the civilians [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=365.21999999999997s)]
*  there. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=372.06s)]
*  But the first trickle of aid has been allowed in. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=373.78s)]
*  A small convoy of aid trucks was allowed in on Saturday, and then another convoy was allowed [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=377.7s)]
*  in on Sunday, and then another small convoy was allowed in today. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=382.78s)]
*  That is good. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=389.22s)]
*  That is not enough, but that is something. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=390.22s)]
*  The aid that has come in thus far does not involve fuel. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=395.34000000000003s)]
*  And while fuel might not seem like the most important thing to supply when you're talking [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=399.06s)]
*  about humanitarian aid, the U.N. is raising urgent concerns about the remaining hospitals [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=402.02000000000004s)]
*  inside Gaza and whether they can keep their generators running, to keep electricity on [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=407.54s)]
*  inside the hospitals, to keep things like ventilators running and life support machines [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=412.18s)]
*  for people who are grievously ill and also for newborn babies. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  The U.S. military has moved considerable resources and personnel to the region. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=421.46s)]
*  There are ongoing worries about the conflict potentially broadening to include other countries [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=425.98s)]
*  and other armed militias in the region. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=429.86s)]
*  The U.S. embassies both in Iraq and in Lebanon have sent out new warnings about the safety [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=431.98s)]
*  of U.S. citizens and U.S. diplomatic staff and their families. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=437.26s)]
*  So all that to say, the biggest of big pictures here remains as precarious as ever, but there [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  is a tiny little bit of hope on one piece of it tonight. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=446.02s)]
*  We saw two hostages who had been taken by Hamas, an Israeli American mother and daughter, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=449.02s)]
*  get released on Friday. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=453.34s)]
*  Tonight, two more hostages have been released. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=455.02s)]
*  This is two frail elderly Israeli women, both in their 80s, both of whom have been held [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=457.62s)]
*  by Hamas for more than two weeks. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=463.54s)]
*  The two of them were released tonight. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=465.46s)]
*  There had been some reports today about the potential release of a much larger group of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=468.9s)]

*  of arrangement. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=479.82s)]
*  But NBC has not been able to confirm independently any of those reports. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=480.82s)]
*  They remain just a glimmer for people who are trying to maintain hope here. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=484.73999999999995s)]
*  So far, only four hostages have been released. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=489.41999999999996s)]
*  Joining us now is NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel live from Jerusalem. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=494.09999999999997s)]
*  Richard, thank you so much for being here. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=497.61999999999995s)]
*  I know it's the middle of the night, four in the morning there. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=498.9s)]
*  I really appreciate you. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=501.34000000000003s)]
*  It's always the middle of the night with you, Rachel. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=505.18s)]
*  No matter where you go in the country, it's always the middle of the night and it's always [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=507.38s)]
*  talking about something grim. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=510.22s)]
*  But yes, how are you? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=511.5s)]
*  It's true. I'm OK, Richard. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=514.26s)]
*  It's always it's true. We need to come up with some other beat that you and I cover [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=516.02s)]
*  together and at better times. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=519.5s)]
*  But Richard, let me ask you about this. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=521.66s)]
*  The hostage situation. Obviously, everybody of you know, everybody's overjoyed to see [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=523.82s)]
*  two hostages released on on Friday to see two more released today. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=529.3s)]
*  There was there was some reporting today, which NBC has not independently confirmed [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=533.9399999999999s)]
*  that maybe we should expect additional hostage releases in larger numbers. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=537.74s)]
*  What's your understanding of that? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=541.8199999999999s)]
*  And what do we know about these older women who are released today? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=544.1s)]
*  So what we're trying to do is to track these negotiations in real time through the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=549.5s)]
*  negotiators. But obviously, the negotiators are working with Hamas, working with the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=555.98s)]
*  Israeli authorities, primarily we're talking about Egyptian and Qatari negotiators. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=562.46s)]
*  And it is a very, very difficult process to follow because obviously for security reasons, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=567.38s)]
*  they don't want to give away too much, but they are actively trying to to trade things. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=573.02s)]
*  Hamas wants certain things. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=579.34s)]
*  It wants the sort of more access for humanitarian supplies into the Gaza Strip. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=581.78s)]
*  It wants some of its prisoners to be released. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=587.54s)]
*  It wants to engage in a kind of resumption of a peace process to to have a path towards statehood. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=590.02s)]
*  We're hearing more and more from Hamas about its specific demands. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=597.42s)]
*  I spoke to a senior Hamas leader tonight about the these specific issues. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  And there is hope that there will be more. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=605.66s)]
*  And during the day today, I was one of those people who thought, OK, there's going to be more. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=608.5s)]
*  There's there was these rumors, reports of a potentially larger group that that could have come out today. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=614.62s)]
*  But these negotiations don't always go well. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=621.5s)]
*  And even when these two Israeli women were were eventually released, Hamas released them, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=624.98s)]
*  but sort of issued a complaint saying we're releasing them even though Israel violated the terms of our agreement eight times. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=632.3s)]
*  And there had been, although we didn't notice it, a mini ceasefire, a pause for a few hours today, according to Hamas. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=642.02s)]
*  And another pause, it said, was six hours long in the airstrikes on Friday. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=651.38s)]
*  So they're negotiating things big and small. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=656.3s)]
*  Sometimes it's just a pause for a few hours or much larger issues about opening access to the Gaza Strip, potentially prisoner swaps, potentially more than that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=659.3399999999999s)]
*  So this this could take some time. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=669.3s)]
*  And every time that there is hope, there is a lot of chance that things could could go wrong, that there's another airstrike changed in complications. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=671.9399999999999s)]
*  Communications are difficult because this senior Hamas leader told me tonight the hostages are held in different places. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=682.3s)]
*  Communication from one place to the other is difficult so that they're they're facing some logistic logistical challenges just to gather these people and try and free them if they want. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=689.9399999999999s)]
*  Now, that could be Hamas coming up with excuses. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=703.5s)]
*  But you said, is it a glimmer of hope? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=706.06s)]
*  Yes, at least there's some movement, at least they're not executing these hostages in a one one every hour or anything like that. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=708.78s)]
*  There does seem to be some progress. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=716.02s)]
*  There are lines of communication to Hamas and and there are there are efforts ongoing by by friendly nations to try and secure these release of these people. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=718.86s)]
*  Richard, it strikes me as a pretty incredible thing in its own right that you've been in touch with senior Hamas officials about about this issue. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=730.3s)]
*  Do they explain or do they put it to you in any way that that you can convey to us why they took these hostages and if they planned from the outset that they would hold these hostages in order to try to extract concessions or ceasefires or any other things that they're asking for now as as just the first four of them had been let go. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=738.26s)]
*  It almost feels from some of the reporting that I've seen about their the hostage taking that Hamas didn't necessarily know what they were going to do with these civilian hostages when they got them, let alone in these large numbers, more than two hundred of them. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=762.7s)]
*  Did they give you any sense, any clarity on what their intention was or what their intentions are in the long run with these people? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=774.7s)]
*  My my interpretation and some of this is just by my analysis of having covered this for for a long time, covered the Middle East covered Hamas for for many years. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=781.46s)]
*  I think they they bit off more than they could chew and that what we're seeing in Gaza is a result of Hamas not realizing how far it was going to get, how how devastating its attack would be, how many people they would take. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=793.5s)]
*  They've also the group has also hinted at that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=809.06s)]
*  There was one statement from their chief military spokesman Abu Ubaidah, who said that they swept up all these foreign nationals by accident because as people were being dragged over the border, they didn't have a chance. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=811.4599999999999s)]
*  This is according to them to verify their identities. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=825.6999999999999s)]
*  And they ended up with too many non Israelis. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=828.6999999999999s)]
*  So even they acknowledge that it was a chaotic time and that they ended up with more people than they wanted. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=832.1800000000001s)]
*  Now, on the other question, what do they want to do with them? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=839.98s)]
*  They clearly intended to take people. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=843.34s)]
*  They clearly went in to to kill people and capture people, but probably not this many and probably not this many foreign nationals bringing the entire world against them. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=845.46s)]
*  What what they want is they want to concessions. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=856.3800000000001s)]
*  They they every time they've taken people in the past, they have been able to secure the release of prisoners. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=859.34s)]
*  Many of the top Hamas leaders themselves, the inner circle of Hamas who are running the group now, were themselves prisoners in Israeli jails who were swapped when when other members of Hamas grabbed an Israeli soldier and then demanded. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=866.5s)]
*  And then part of that part of their demands was it was a prisoner release. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=884.3000000000001s)]
*  So they, the top leadership themselves, know this process from personal experience. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=888.0200000000001s)]
*  It secured their own release. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=893.7s)]
*  So I think at the end, as we get closer and more and more hostages come out and and hopefully that will happen. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=895.74s)]
*  Hopefully that will happen soon. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=903.38s)]
*  And in larger numbers, I think we're going to start hearing not just demands about more access for humanitarian aid into Gaza and more access to for for fuel and other things. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=904.74s)]
*  But we'll start they'll start asking for the more specifically for the demands of prisoners. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=914.82s)]
*  And they've already said that as well. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=919.82s)]
*  One of the Hamas leaders I was talking to said in order to release the soldiers, they make a difference. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=921.9000000000001s)]
*  They make a distinction between the civilians and the soldiers. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=927.3000000000001s)]
*  Although here in Israel with Hamas, it's quite difficult because a lot of Israelis until they're they're quite old can potentially be reservists in this country. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=931.22s)]
*  So who gets considered a soldier is a little bit up to Hamas's interpretation. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=940.62s)]
*  But they have said for the soldiers, not specifying exactly what they who they consider a soldier, if you're active duty, non active duty, serving in uniform, out of uniform, et cetera. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=945.82s)]
*  They said they want the release of all Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=956.5400000000001s)]
*  And there are thousands of them. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=960.6600000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=963.14s)]
*  Richard Engel, chief foreign correspondent for NBC News. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=964.38s)]
*  This has been a day of real ups and downs specifically on this issue of the Israeli hostages. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=966.98s)]
*  Thanks for keeping us up to date and keeping us honest on this, Richard. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=972.9s)]
*  I appreciate it, my friend. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=975.5s)]
*  Sure thing. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=978.62s)]
*  Here's something that I think should have received more attention than it has. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=980.38s)]
*  Among the many things the House of Representatives can't do right now because Republicans can't elect even one of their own number as speaker. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=986.34s)]
*  Among the things the House can't do is it can't take up President Biden's request for money for Ukraine and Israel. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=994.14s)]
*  There is a third part of that funding request, though, which is languishing, that has gotten a little less attention. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1000.86s)]
*  The funding request that's on the table right now includes several billion dollars for security at America's southern border, as well as services for immigrants who are already here and who are awaiting immigration hearings. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1009.06s)]
*  While that money depends on congressional Republicans getting their act together, though, there is one change to America's immigration system that is set to go ahead regardless of whether or not they ever get their act together. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1021.14s)]
*  And it's because it's coming through the courts. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1034.02s)]
*  A settlement between the federal government and the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU, looks like it is finally going to bring at least some closure to one of the darkest chapters of the Donald J. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1036.5s)]
*  Trump presidential administration, one of the darkest chapters of our moral lives in this generation. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1047.86s)]
*  You will recall that under the Trump administration's so-called zero tolerance immigration policy, we saw thousands of little kids separated from their moms and dads, taken out of their mom and dad's arms. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1055.34s)]
*  The children were put into government custody while many of the parents were deported or prosecuted, according to the Department of Homeland Security, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1068.74s)]
*  even though there's been a Biden administration task force from day one that has been working on this. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1075.02s)]
*  As of at least a few months ago, roughly a thousand kids still have not been reunited with their families. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1079.5400000000002s)]
*  And this is due in large part to the fact that the Trump administration, while they were taking all these kids away from their moms and dads, they did not bother to keep track of which parents went with which kids and where different family members were sent. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1087.26s)]
*  But now, if this new settlement is signed off on by a federal judge, family separation will formally be banned in this country. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1100.9s)]
*  The settlement also provides for support services for those who were separated from their families when Trump was president, including things like housing and medical care and behavioral health benefits, which you might expect they will need. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1109.26s)]
*  For these immigrant families dealing with the trauma of the U.S. government coming in and taking away the kids from their parents. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1122.98s)]
*  Attorney General Merrick Garland said this about the settlement. He said, quote, The practice of separating families at the southwest border was shameful. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1128.62s)]
*  This agreement will facilitate the reunification of separated families and provide them with critical services to aid in their recovery. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1136.02s)]
*  Again, it still needs to be approved by a federal judge, but, you know, this is a a moral wound that can never really be healed. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1145.58s)]
*  This happened in your family. It will have multi-generation consequences. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1155.42s)]
*  Right. But but at least this right at least this thing, which we all lived through that we can never forget happened in our country and all in our time in which we are therefore all at some level required to morally answer for at least this. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1159.58s)]
*  At least we're finally starting to find this up and to fix it at last. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1uymrBk7OU&t=1175.9s)]
