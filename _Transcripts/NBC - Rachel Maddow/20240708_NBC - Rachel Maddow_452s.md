# Repellant Trump candidacy tempers debate fallout for Biden in state-level push
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w)
*  I keep seeing all those stories about I'm being too old. I wasn't too old to create over 15 million new jobs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm too old to put the first black woman on a speed card in the United States of America, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=6.0s)]
*  signed most significant gun safety law in 30 years. So let me ask you, what do you think? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=10.0s)]
*  You think I'm too old to restore Roe v. Wade to law of the land? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=15.0s)]
*  You think I'm too old to ban assault weapons again? You think I'm too old to beat Donald Trump? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=18.0s)]
*  President Joe Biden firing back at naysayers with a new ad from the campaign trailer [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=24.0s)]
*  features him speaking at a rally Friday in Madison, Wisconsin, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=29.0s)]
*  selling his record on health care, climate, gun safety, and more in a critical battleground state. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=32.0s)]
*  The rally was Biden's fifth campaign trip to Wisconsin, his first since his debate with Donald Trump. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=38.0s)]
*  And while Democrats at the national level are wondering whether Biden can recover from his performance on debate night in Atlanta, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=43.0s)]
*  the view from swing state Wisconsin might surprise you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=50.0s)]
*  The chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wickler, telling reporters last week, quote, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=53.0s)]
*  he did not believe the dynamic of the race was changed by Biden's performance at the debate when he was often groping for words. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=57.0s)]
*  A crucial set of voters has reservations about both candidates, Wickler said, and that remains the case, end quote. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=64.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Ben Wickler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. Ben, good to see you again. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=71.0s)]
*  This is an interesting point. It's an important point because usually there are turning points in campaigns and there are a lot of people who think the debate was a turning point. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=76.0s)]
*  And then within about a week, you see the effect that they've had. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=82.0s)]
*  We've seen this for, you know, campaign after campaign. That didn't really happen here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=86.0s)]
*  People are largely locked into where they are. There's been some movement, some of it negative for Joe Biden. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=90.0s)]
*  In a couple of instances, it looks like there has been no movement. But tell me what you're seeing on the ground. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=96.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. It's great to be with you here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=101.0s)]
*  And it was a rough debate. And then our volunteers fanned out across Wisconsin, knocked on tens of thousands of doors. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=104.0s)]
*  And you know what? No voters told our volunteers when they were talking, talking to them the weekend right after the debate. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=112.0s)]
*  Nobody said that Biden seems so old in the debate that I now want doctors to be jailed if they provide abortions. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=119.0s)]
*  Nobody said Biden seems so old that I think billionaires should pay less taxes so that my prices can be jacked up by special interests. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=126.0s)]
*  Nobody said that the stakes in the debate are still what they were before. In fact, they're higher after the Supreme Court decision. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=133.0s)]
*  And our job, our path to victory in this election is to make the stakes for freedom, for democracy, for working people. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=140.0s)]
*  The core thing people are voting on in November. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=148.0s)]
*  Yeah. So so in fact, to the degree that the election is binary, the other side of the binary stays the same. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=150.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, who this week tried very creatively, last week tried very creatively to say, I don't know what this project 2025 is, don't know what it's about, don't agree with. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=155.0s)]
*  Don't know what it is, but I don't agree with it, which is typical Donald Trump inconsistency. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=163.0s)]
*  But but that's true. I mean, people vote on abortion. People vote on on their finances. People vote on their wages. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=167.0s)]
*  They vote on inflation. They vote on health care. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=174.0s)]
*  They vote on a lot of things. And the debate performance didn't change that for a lot of people. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=176.0s)]
*  That's right. And when voters watched the debate, you know, Biden was raspy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=181.0s)]
*  And sometimes he lost track of the sentence. And then he came back and made very clear that he's on the side of working people. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=188.0s)]
*  Donald Trump was very clearly on the side of himself. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=195.0s)]
*  And there were voters who hadn't seen Trump in a long time who watched that debate and were shocked when Trump tried to make it sound like Nancy Pelosi had organized. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=198.0s)]
*  January 6th, they knew full well that Donald Trump was the guy who tried to overturn the election and shred our democracy and kick voters in the teeth. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=205.0s)]
*  So those issues, those issues that have motivated Democrats to victory in Wisconsin in the governor's race in twenty twenty two, the Supreme Court race in twenty twenty three. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=213.0s)]
*  Those are still right here. And they're right here as the Republicans prepare to come to Wisconsin for their convention next week. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=222.0s)]
*  We have the Democratic Party has billboards and the sides of buses all over Milwaukee reminding voters about what these what the stakes are. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=230.0s)]
*  And the Republican Party really doesn't have a path to run away from the thing that Trump's own team has set out with 20, 25, a blueprint for Trump and dictatorship. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=238.0s)]
*  It's wild. I mean, chapter after chapter is authored by somebody who worked for Donald Trump, including Peter Navarro, who's in jail. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=247.0s)]
*  That was that's the trade chapter in Project 20, 25. That said, I had an interesting conversation with Maxine Waters earlier today who talks a lot about the things that Joe Biden has achieved that don't they don't feel like a change in the temperature, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=255.0s)]
*  Manufacturing jobs are are are up. We're creating we're building semiconductors in the United States. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=268.0s)]
*  Infrastructure is being fixed. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=274.0s)]
*  If you buy insulin, you're capped on how much you'll pay for it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=278.0s)]
*  How much of this election should be on Biden's record, which is good versus the threat of Donald Trump? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=282.0s)]
*  How do you balance those two things when talking to a voter at their door? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=289.0s)]
*  So they're linked in a way that I think is not yet visible to people because the argument is just beginning to be made. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=292.0s)]
*  What we saw with the Affordable Care Act is that passing it didn't yield political dividends for Democrats. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=299.0s)]
*  But the Republicans threat of taking it away was a disaster. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=305.0s)]
*  Joe Biden right now has expanded health insurance to millions more people. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=309.0s)]
*  Donald Trump still wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and kick tens of millions of people off of their health insurance, remove protections for people with preexisting conditions. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=313.0s)]
*  Biden has passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate investment. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=322.0s)]
*  Now there are big projects going up all over the country. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=326.0s)]
*  Trump wants to repeal it. Trump wants to take away the clean energy incentives that people are using to upgrade their houses and make their lives better and bring their energy costs down. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=329.0s)]
*  Trump wants to shred the progress that we've made. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=338.0s)]
*  And people do not like that idea. They don't like things being taken away. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=341.0s)]
*  And I think this is the job. I mean, Wisconsin elections come down to less than one percentage point over and over. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=345.0s)]
*  We call it the margin of effort. It's about a quarter of Lambeau Field. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=350.0s)]
*  If you fill that stadium up, you've got four of Biden's margin of victory. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=353.0s)]
*  That means that if someone volunteers at wisdoms.org, talks to voters and lays out what Trump will do to them if he gets in the office and they lay out Biden, you make the case. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=356.0s)]
*  That pivots right into the abortion discussion because it's a rights taken away. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=366.0s)]
*  There are people who voted against taking rights away in some of these states that have had these statewide votes who may, I don't know what their view on abortion is, but they certainly don't want handmaid's tail. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=370.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. And the thing that's terrifying is for whatever Trump, you know, it's this goes into the national platform with the Republican Party. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=381.0s)]
*  His own team has put together a project 2025 with its plan for a national abortion ban that doesn't require passing a law. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=389.0s)]
*  I mean, once you can break the law and have immunity from criminal prosecution and once you dismantle the machinery of the federal government that's supposed to serve the public and make it personal servants to Donald Trump, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=396.0s)]
*  you can really start crushing the freedoms that people rely on. That's what Trump is promising. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=407.0s)]
*  And the special interests who are swarming to a side, they know exactly what he's planning because they wrote the plans. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=412.0s)]
*  So the more we get the word out about the stakes, the more voters actually come to us because they don't want their freedoms taken away. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=417.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to make sure people understand what is actually at stake here. Ben, good to see you as always. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=423.0s)]
*  Ben Wickler is the chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHQDFAWS49w&t=427.0s)]
