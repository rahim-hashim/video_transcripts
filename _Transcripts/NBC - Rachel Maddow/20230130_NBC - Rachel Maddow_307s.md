# Fallout continues for responders tied to Tyre Nichols killing
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU)
*  Since that video footage was released on Friday, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=0.0s)]
*  Memphis police now say they have suspended two more officers [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  beyond the five that we previously knew about. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=6.24s)]
*  They say these two officers were relieved of duty [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=9.1s)]
*  the day after Tyree Nichols died [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=11.28s)]
*  and before the video was made public. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  These two officers are suspended, not fired, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=16.28s)]
*  and at this point they're not facing charges [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=18.92s)]
*  like the other five officers are. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=20.72s)]
*  Also, the Memphis Fire Department says they have fired [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=23.52s)]
*  two EMTs and a lieutenant. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=26.16s)]
*  For the failure to render aid to Mr. Nichols [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=29.180000000000003s)]
*  after EMTs arrived on the scene, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=32.42s)]
*  and Mr. Nichols lay there mortally wounded [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=35.42s)]
*  and desperately in need of help. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=37.800000000000004s)]
*  This all comes as Mr. Nichols' family prepare to lay him to rest [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=40.660000000000004s)]
*  this Wednesday, the day after tomorrow will be his funeral. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=45.14s)]
*  Next week, Mr. Nichols' parents have been invited [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=48.18000000000001s)]
*  to attend the State of the Union. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=50.540000000000006s)]
*  They'd be guests of Nevada Congressman Stephen Horsford, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=51.88s)]
*  who leads the Congressional Black Caucus, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=54.980000000000004s)]
*  if they choose to go. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=57.08s)]
*  There's additional protests and vigils happening tonight [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=59.339999999999996s)]
*  as we speak in Memphis, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=62.18s)]
*  in places as far-flung as Chicago. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=65.22s)]
*  Also, what we're seeing here is a vigil at a skate park [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  in Sacramento, California, where Mr. Nichols is from. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=71.56s)]
*  We'll let you know more as we learn more. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=75.5s)]
*  We're keeping an eye on all those gatherings tonight. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=76.66s)]
*  Joining us now is Vicki Terry. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  She's Executive Director of the Memphis branch [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=81.46s)]
*  for the NAACP. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=83.6s)]
*  Ms. Terry, thank you so much for being here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=85.2s)]
*  I know this is just a really difficult time [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=87.0s)]
*  and one where there's a lot of demands on your time. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=89.64s)]
*  Thank you so much, Rachel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  I appreciate you having me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  Since the release of the video on Friday, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=97.04s)]
*  we have learned about more suspensions of officers, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=100.38000000000001s)]
*  firings of EMTs from the fire department, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  people who didn't render aid, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=106.12s)]
*  even though they were there and capable of doing that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  I just have to ask what's your reaction [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=109.86000000000001s)]
*  to these ongoing developments over the past few days? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=111.72s)]
*  Well, I'm not surprised because I had heard [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=116.36s)]
*  that there would be more people fired, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=119.5s)]
*  or disciplines because of what part they took [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=121.9s)]
*  in not rendering aid or just being there [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  and not doing anything. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=130.5s)]
*  So I figured that there would be more [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=131.88s)]
*  and I'm thinking there will be even more [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=134.58s)]
*  that will be disciplined or let go. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=137.68s)]
*  I'm not sure which one they're gonna do. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=140.5s)]
*  And thinking about individual people being disciplined, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  as you say, or being fired, being charged in some cases, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=150.64s)]
*  that's an important part of accountability here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  But I was thinking this weekend about the disbanding [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=156.88s)]
*  of this Scorpion unit, which is the unit [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  to which the five officers had been charged [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=161.88s)]
*  that they all belonged to. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=164.38s)]
*  And that is a sort of different type of accountability, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=166.22s)]
*  it's a little bit of structural change [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=170.44s)]
*  rather than just personal accountability person by person. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=172.04s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about that difference tonight. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=175.74s)]
*  I wonder if that's maybe a potential opening [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=177.78s)]
*  for some bigger changes, for some larger scale progress. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=179.82s)]
*  Well, I think that it should be disbanded right now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  We need to, they need to investigate more [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=186.88s)]
*  because there are probably other incidents [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=190.66s)]
*  that have happened with these Scorpion units [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=194.06s)]
*  that we don't know about. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=197.3s)]
*  So I think an investigation needs to be made [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=198.9s)]
*  into that unit and even others that, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=201.74s)]
*  maybe gang units, tactical units, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=205.94000000000003s)]
*  anything that we have a, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  I guess where you have all of these officers out here [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  and we don't know exactly what they're doing [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=215.58s)]
*  because I've heard of others that have been attacked [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=217.58s)]
*  by the Scorpion unit. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure myself, but there are other things [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=222.26000000000002s)]
*  that are going on. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=225.8s)]
*  You always hear the rumors or whatever. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=227.06s)]
*  So they need to do a full investigation [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=229.16s)]
*  of the Scorpion unit, go to the internal affairs [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=231.84s)]
*  to see if reports have been given to them [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=235.24s)]
*  that have not been followed up. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=238.54s)]
*  I've even had some that come in my office [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=240.68s)]
*  in the past few days after this was announced. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=243.02s)]
*  So other people are coming forward now saying [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=248.46s)]
*  that this has happened to them or to their son [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=251.36s)]
*  or to someone they know. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  That form of accountability, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=257.7s)]
*  of airing out the depth of the problem, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=259.52s)]
*  the number of victims, the number of people [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=262.34s)]
*  who may have been victimized by a system this broken. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=264.46s)]
*  Kate, obviously, that's part of really addressing [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=269.38s)]
*  what happened. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=274.14s)]
*  Vicki Terry, executive director of the Memphis branch [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=274.98s)]
*  of the NAACP. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=278.46s)]
*  Ms. Terry, again, I know this is a difficult time. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=279.38s)]
*  Thank you for making time to be here with us tonight. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=281.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=283.38s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=284.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=286.14000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I71rgFYvowU&t=286.98s)]
