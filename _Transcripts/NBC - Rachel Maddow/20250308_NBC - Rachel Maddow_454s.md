# Who is DOGE's muscle as they force their way through federal offices?
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0)
*  All right. Let's start with the photo. This appears in the New York Times. It looks like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=0.0s)]
*  it might be from a freight elevator, maybe, from the sort of atmospherics here, but you [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=4.68s)]
*  can see the caption there. Workers from the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=9.6s)]
*  preparing to enter the offices of the U.S. African Development Foundation after U.S. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=14.68s)]
*  Marshals opened the doors on Thursday afternoon. The New York Times and other places reporting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=18.72s)]
*  on the kids from DOGE being let into this tiny federal agency that they had previously [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=24.88s)]
*  tried unsuccessfully to get into. They tried on Wednesday to get in, and the agency wouldn't [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=32.76s)]
*  let them in. They came back Thursday, and they were let into the agency by U.S. Marshals [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=38.04s)]
*  who opened the doors for them. Once inside, they reportedly changed the locks. So presumably [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=43.0s)]
*  behind those locked doors, they could go about the business of trying to dismantle that agency [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  and fire everyone in it. Same basic story from the Washington Post reporting that the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=55.12s)]
*  DOGE kids showed up, quote, with five U.S. Marshals. The Post reporting that the people [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=59.48s)]
*  who work at that agency, they were warned by colleagues who were having lunch nearby [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=67.28s)]
*  who saw the DOGE kids coming, warned that the DOGE guys were on the way with U.S. Marshals. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=72.7s)]
*  The staffers then used the stairs, not the elevator, to get out of the building. They [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=78.8s)]
*  slipped out that way. They left their belongings behind, quote, to avoid a confrontation with [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=83.24s)]
*  DOGE and the U.S. Marshals. So this is a very dramatic story, right, about a tiny agency [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=88.2s)]
*  created by Congress. Legally, only Congress has the authority to shut them down. Trump [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=94.32s)]
*  is trying to shut them down anyway, trying to use this DOGE entity that is under the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=99.34s)]
*  control of his top campaign donor to do it, maybe. They don't explain themselves much, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=105.06s)]
*  but it seems like that's what they're doing. At this tiny agency, the staffers there tried [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=110.46000000000001s)]
*  to hold the line and keep operating as an agency by essentially keeping the doors closed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=114.5s)]
*  while the DOGE guys tried to muscle their way in, pounded on the door and said, let [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  us in. Here's what I want to know, though. When those DOGE kids came back the second [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  day, they came back on Thursday, and according to all the press reports, U.S. Marshals left [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=132.5s)]
*  them in the building. Was it U.S. Marshals? Who is that in the elevator with the DOGE [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=136.5s)]
*  kids, really? We have reason to question whether the men reported as U.S. Marshals, now in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=144.14s)]
*  multiple press accounts, are actually U.S. Marshals in the usual sense. We asked the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=149.58s)]
*  Department of Justice about it, since the Marshals are part of DOJ. DOJ told us, quote, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=155.66s)]
*  We are not making a statement at this time. We do request that you please verify with [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=160.24s)]
*  your sources to ensure your reporting would be accurate. We absolutely are trying. It [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=165.94s)]
*  would help a lot if you guys would answer the question, are those U.S. Marshals? That [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=172.52s)]
*  said, while that sort of unsettling detail remains outstanding, while we literally cannot [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  it is that showing up apparently armed to let DOJ staffers into locked doors that legally [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=185.6s)]
*  they may not be allowed to be in, while that remains unsettled, the question of who is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=194.32s)]
*  the armed escort for what DOJ is trying to do. The Justice Department appears to be conducting [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=202.84s)]
*  another one of their Friday night purges of career officials, firings at Maine Justice [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=208.64s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. tonight and at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan. Two prosecutors [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=212.84s)]
*  from the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams were placed on administrative [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=217.28s)]
*  leave tonight. Reporting from NBC News indicates that in Manhattan, those prosecutors were [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=222.52s)]
*  walked out of the building by U.S. Marshals. Joining us now is Ryan Reilly, NBC News justice [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=228.0s)]
*  reporter. Ryan, thanks very much for being here. I appreciate it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=234.32s)]
*  No problem. Thanks for having me. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=237.76s)]
*  This is a question that ultimately will have a simple answer. While it remains outstanding, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=239.72s)]
*  I will admit to being a little unnerved. DOJ is involved in actions that a lot of people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=244.4s)]
*  in government agencies say are not legal. This small agency that they tried very hard [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=249.24s)]
*  to get into and ultimately succeeded in getting into today said that they did not have the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=254.24s)]
*  authority to come inside their offices, that Congress was the only entity that could dissolve [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=258.16s)]
*  this agency or fire its members. Nevertheless, DOJ was able to summon some sort of muscle, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=263.2s)]
*  some sort of force to force them into that building physically, despite the fact that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=268.6s)]
*  the agency told them no, they couldn't come in. Do you have any sense of who that muscle [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=273.6s)]
*  was or how we could find out? Yeah, you know, normally that's something [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=280.0s)]
*  that we would be able to find out from the Department of Justice, but I think there's [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  so much chaos and I really just can't underscore the amount of chaos that's happening inside [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=287.92s)]
*  DOJ at this moment. You know, you not only had those prosecutors who were pushed out, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=292.92s)]
*  you not only had these leadership changes that are being instituted today at DOJ, but [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=297.92s)]
*  you also have people going after individual, you know, line attorneys who made critical [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=302.52s)]
*  comments of U.S. Attorney Ed Martin on social media, right? There's people who are now have [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  been priced on administrative leave because of that. So, you know, this force, the U.S. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  Marshals is typically something that, you know, follows judicial orders or there's a [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  process for or they're following, you know, that sort of procedure. They also have this [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=323.36s)]
*  critical role in protecting judges. So the idea that, you know, actual U.S. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  Marshals were being sort of summoned by DOJ to to go behind the scenes would be a big [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  deal, but we just don't have the evidence to suggest right now that they are indeed [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=335.88s)]
*  U.S. Marshals. There's nothing from the government saying affirmatively that these were [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=340.2s)]
*  indeed these were indeed Marshals. We just don't really have that reporting. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=344.36s)]
*  And I think because of all of this just enormous level of chaos, it's really difficult to get [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=349.04s)]
*  sort of get straight answers out of the Department of Justice at the moment. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=353.68s)]
*  And there's so many people behind the scenes, I think, who are really worried about [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=357.0s)]
*  speaking out and talking to reporters just about what's going on there because they're [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=360.47999999999996s)]
*  worried about the consequences that that will have for them. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=364.84s)]
*  You know, typically being a federal government employee, you have some level of security. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=367.28s)]
*  And even though it was difficult to get sources to talk to you, that people weren't worried [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=371.56s)]
*  about just being instantly kicked out for any contact whatsoever or for sort of various [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=376.52s)]
*  reasons or because someone has a grudge against them. And that has sort of been thrown out the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=380.8s)]
*  window in the last few weeks. People are really afraid for their jobs. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=384.56s)]
*  And there's certainly folks who are speaking out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=388.24s)]
*  And I appreciate every single one of them who's contacting me over over signal or what [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=390.72s)]
*  have you. But it's a really chaotic situation inside the Justice Department right now and not a lot [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=395.32s)]
*  of certainty about about what's going to happen next. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=400.52s)]
*  Yeah, a chaotic situation in terms of the firings, a chaotic situation in terms of obviously [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=403.64s)]
*  some of the ethics and the ethical and legal issues happening, but also impossible to get straight [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=408.28000000000003s)]
*  answers as to the use of force inside the U.S. government, one part of the government against [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=414.24s)]
*  another. This is very unsettling stuff. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=419.88s)]
*  And I know you're on it, Ryan. I know that if anybody's going to be able to figure it out, you will. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=423.2s)]
*  Ryan Reilly, NBC News Justice reporter, thanks for working so hard on these stories. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=426.12s)]
*  It's such a such a tough time, Ryan. I appreciate it so much. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmveXTIzGj0&t=430.08s)]
