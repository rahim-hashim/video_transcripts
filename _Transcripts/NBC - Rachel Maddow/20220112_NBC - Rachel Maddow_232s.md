# Fake Elector Struggles To Explain Role In Scheme To Submit False Election Papers
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU)
*  So this is interesting. We've got late breaking news today out of the great state of Arizona, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=0.0s)]
*  which never disappoints in news terms. All right. I was speaking earlier in the show [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  tonight about a story that we've been on for a while now. The story of Republicans appearing [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=8.6s)]
*  to have forged fake documents after the 2020 election, putting themselves forward officially [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=12.8s)]
*  as if they were the real electors from their states when in fact they were not. In each [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=19.2s)]
*  of the five states that we've been able to find the documents from in Michigan, Wisconsin, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  Georgia, Nevada and Arizona, Republicans filed these fake forged documents, claiming [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=29.0s)]
*  that those states had actually picked Trump electors who were casting the state's electoral [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=34.64s)]
*  college votes for Trump, when in fact the real electors from those states were Biden [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=38.84s)]
*  electors. Republicans forged these documents. They submitted them, we believe, both to Congress [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=42.96s)]
*  and to the National Archives to try to pass them off as the real deal. We've been trying [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=47.66s)]
*  to get a hold of some of these people who signed their names to these forged documents [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=52.04s)]
*  to learn more about this apparent coordinated scheme, particularly since we noticed that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=55.84s)]
*  all of the forgeries from those five states appear to be very similar, similar enough [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=60.28s)]
*  that it looks like they were part of a coordinated multi-state effort. We're still working on [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=64.16s)]
*  our part of that. But tonight, NBC's Great Station in Phoenix and a reporter from the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  Arizona Republic caught up with one of the people who signed onto this document in Arizona. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=73.08000000000001s)]
*  His name is Jake Hoffman. He's a Republican state representative in Arizona. You can see [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=78.06s)]
*  here that's his kind of amazing signature on the forged fake elector form from Arizona. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  A cameraman from KPNX and an Arizona Republic reporter named Richard Ruales caught up with [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Hoffman today. And this is what happened. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  When Bram wants to ask a real question, happy to have a conversation with him. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=101.44s)]
*  I'm asking you that question. I wonder what authority did you find yourself as an elected? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=112.32s)]
*  So in unprecedented times, unprecedented action is occurred. There is no case law. There's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=119.32s)]
*  no precedent that exists as to whether or not an election that is currently being litigated [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  in the courts has due standing, which is why we felt it appropriate to provide Congress [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=131.24s)]
*  and the vice president with dueling opinions. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=137.04s)]
*  Did you have direction from anybody in doing this? Was it you, 11 yourself, doing this? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=141.2s)]
*  Or did someone give you advice on the manner in which you can do it? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=146.92s)]
*  So I'm simply, I was one of the electors. I'm not in charge of the electors. So you [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  would need to ask the party chair. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=155.92s)]
*  How did you hear about it? How did you hear about the plan? Were you just told to be someone? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=156.92s)]
*  You would need to ask the party chair that question. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=162.6s)]
*  But you're the person who received the call. You showed up, right? How did you know to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=164.16s)]
*  show up that day? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=167.92s)]
*  So as I said, you can go ahead and ask the party chair the logistics of it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=169.04s)]
*  Ask her how you got a phone call to go somewhere? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=172.76s)]
*  You're welcome to talk to them about the logistics. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=174.64s)]
*  Do you not know how you arrived at a place? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=175.92s)]
*  Thank you. I appreciate your question. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=178.12s)]
*  Do you really not know how you got a call? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=179.12s)]
*  Have a great one. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=181.12s)]
*  The other question. I was hoping to hear. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=182.12s)]
*  Okay, and a reporter from the Arizona Republic there, Richard Ruales, catching up with that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=187.12s)]
*  man who signed that forged document. Again, the camera work there from KPNX, the NBC affiliate [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=193.76s)]
*  in in Phoenix. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=198.92s)]
*  I'm supposed to call the party chair to ask her how you got a phone call to go somewhere. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=200.84s)]
*  Do you not know how you arrived at a place? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  Do you really not know how you got a call? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=205.92s)]
*  We're still working on this story, but now lots of other people are, too. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=208.6s)]
*  We're going to get to the bottom of this. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx-m6v4bTU&t=211.12s)]
