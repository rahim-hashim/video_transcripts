# Republican Voting Restriction Strategy Already Bearing Fruit In Texas
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE)
*  At the rally, former President Trump held in Arizona this weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=0.0s)]
*  One of the Republicans who signed the forged elector document from Arizona, he spoke as [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=3.88s)]
*  one of the warm-up acts for Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=8.22s)]
*  Because why not? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=10.68s)]
*  This is what a rally is like now for the presumed Republican presidential nominee in the next [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=12.34s)]
*  election. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=17.12s)]
*  Who won the election? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=18.12s)]
*  You're right, Trump won! [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=21.12s)]
*  Trump won! [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  We are going to fix 2020. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  I hope that we're going to decertify 2020. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=28.9s)]
*  How about you? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=31.54s)]
*  And no more are they going to be able to get away with this kind of deception, this kind [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=35.62s)]
*  of fraud and illegal activity. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=41.4s)]
*  Not only people in general, but the election workers. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=44.22s)]
*  We want indictments of the election workers so that they don't continue to do this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=47.86s)]
*  I've had several media outlets call me, Washington Post, CNN, and they want to know why I wasn't [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=54.5s)]
*  Trump elector. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=61.18s)]
*  Donald Trump won this election. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  And I call upon the Arizona legislature to vote to decertify the 2020 election. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=64.94s)]
*  Putting the people who signed the forged elector paperwork up on stage so everybody can cheer [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=74.78s)]
*  for them, to get them warmed up for cheering for the former president. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=82.06s)]
*  This kind of stuff does seem crazy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=88.06s)]
*  This seems like the whole vibe on the Trump rally thing is kind of low-rent and out there, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=89.7s)]
*  right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=94.5s)]
*  But this is what it's like in the Republican party right now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=95.5s)]
*  This is how they are gearing up for the next election. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=98.0s)]
*  Indict the election workers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  But it is working for them as planned, even in the high-rent districts. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=103.7s)]
*  The new Texas voting restrictions were, like in many states, they were passed on the pretext [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=107.26s)]
*  that all that election fraud that made the last election stolen, that justified lots [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=113.66000000000001s)]
*  of new laws in Texas to make it harder to vote in that state. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=117.62s)]
*  That's paying off already. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  You saw the headline this weekend. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=121.46000000000001s)]
*  Election officials in Texas reject hundreds of ballot applications under the state's new [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=123.58000000000001s)]
*  voting restrictions. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  Quote, election officials in one of the most populous counties in Texas have rejected about [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=128.1s)]
*  half of the applications for ballots because of the state's new voting restrictions enacted [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=131.74s)]
*  by Republicans last year. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=136.42s)]
*  Texas Republicans last year passed their bill, establishing new limits on voting over the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=138.14s)]
*  objections of Democrats, part of a wave of efforts led by Republican-led states, excuse [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=142.01999999999998s)]
*  me, a wave of efforts by Republican-led states to impose new restrictions. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=146.5s)]
*  Many in the Republican party echoed former President Donald Trump's baseless claims of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=151.32s)]
*  widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election in arguing for the new restrictions. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  The county clerk's office in Travis County, the fifth most populous county and home to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=160.1s)]
*  Texas's capital of Austin, cited the new law's recent changes to ID requirements in rejecting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=164.1s)]
*  about half of the 700 applications for mail-in ballots. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=170.26000000000002s)]
*  The throwing out half the ballot applications because the new restrictive voting law says [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  they have to be. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=183.38s)]
*  Because and you had to pass that voting restriction law because of all the fraud. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=185.5s)]
*  De-certify, decertify. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=189.86s)]
*  It's working perfectly for them. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=192.46s)]
*  I mean, it looks crazy to the rest of the country, but it is working perfectly for them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=193.86s)]
*  And what's to stop them? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yIT5tAkhXE&t=200.18s)]
