# At Hungarian Border, Ukrainian Refugees Defy Russian Invasion With Hope
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8)
*  They were running for their lives, frantically trying to keep their families together amid [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=0.0s)]
*  the mayhem and gunfire, desperately handing over their toddlers to soldiers and strangers, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=8.98s)]
*  scrambling to get away from the firing and shelling even as they fled. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=15.5s)]
*  Many have spent days under fire, trapped in their homes until they realized it was run [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  or die, with the Russians getting closer. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=25.18s)]
*  The stream of people fleeing are traumatized, but many are also angry and full of despair. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=30.259999999999998s)]
*  Putin's a war criminal, she says, the Antichrist. You've been waiting for him, now you've got [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=36.42s)]
*  him. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=42.42s)]
*  Families have been torn apart in the chaos. They ran into Erpin from a village outside [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  before escaping Erpin too, and they've left elderly relatives behind. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=48.54s)]
*  All houses are in fire and that's all that they can see. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=54.46s)]
*  How much destruction is there that you can see in the town center? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=58.02s)]
*  I think all destroyed. There is nothing to help, there is nothing to build or defend. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=62.46s)]
*  There is nothing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=69.66s)]
*  I came here and I left my parents to die, she tells us, and I told my husband, you've [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=73.18s)]
*  to go back and bring them here because I can't just leave them to die. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=77.69999999999999s)]
*  But in amongst this suffering and trauma, there are small glimpses of hope. Her 81-year-old [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=85.3s)]
*  mother and father are found. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=90.58s)]
*  And the family is reunited. How could I live without you, she says. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  There is incredible heartache and fear, but also an astonishing defiance about these people. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=103.34s)]
*  Alex Crawford, Sky News in Erpin. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  That was Alex Crawford reporting from Erpin, a small town northwest of Kyiv, where Ukrainian [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=113.9s)]
*  families have been fleeing amid heavy Russian shelling. Those families, if they are lucky, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  will join the war, more than 1.7 million refugees, mostly women and children, who have fled Ukraine [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=123.54s)]
*  since Russia began its invasion 12 days ago. All this migration in less than two weeks [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=129.66s)]
*  makes this the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, according to [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=134.7s)]
*  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. And with Russia potentially targeting more population [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=140.14s)]
*  centers across the country, millions more Ukrainian refugees will likely flee and need [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=145.22s)]
*  some place to stay. Refugees like this 11-year-old Ukrainian boy named Hassan, who arrived at [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  the Slovakian border alone this weekend. He traveled about 600 miles by himself with only [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  a backpack, a plastic bag, his passport, and more importantly, a phone number written on [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=162.98s)]
*  the back of his hand. The Slovakian Ministry of the Interior says that volunteers were [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  able to use that phone number to reach the boy's relatives who arrived to pick him up. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=173.1s)]
*  Today, Hassan met with the Interior Minister of Slovakia, who says the young boy has already [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=177.57999999999998s)]
*  sought temporary protection in the country. Slovakian officials called him a hero for [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=182.5s)]
*  making that long journey. And there are millions more like him trying to make their trek to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=186.98s)]
*  safety too. Meanwhile, here near Hungary's border with Ukraine, we're also seeing an [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=191.7s)]
*  influx of refugees. I got a chance to speak with some of them and with their humanitarians [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=196.48s)]
*  who are coming to their aid. Here, smoke rises from chimneys that were new a century ago. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=201.7s)]
*  The tiny village of Ticebek, Hungary, sits just across the river from a now war-torn [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=209.7s)]
*  Ukraine. But as refugees pour out of these buses, it might as well be a world apart. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=214.82s)]
*  I feel that I don't have a home because somebody think that they just can take over country. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=221.29999999999998s)]
*  It's not normal. We need to do something. I really wanted to stay in Ukraine. I love [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=228.86s)]
*  Ukraine. It's my home. But I can't. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=238.86s)]
*  A home both unsafe and for now unreachable. Friends Svetlana Paolo and Oylina Hradek [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=243.58s)]
*  met in Kyiv. Oylina hails from the Donbas region. No stranger to fighting, but fighting [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=250.58s)]
*  that hadn't touched her home until two weeks ago. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=256.66s)]
*  My part of Donbas is Ukraine. But now Russian military come to my home. And now I don't [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  know what will happen to my mom, with my grandma, with my two grandma tomorrow, today, right [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=273.5s)]
*  now. I don't know because they don't have internet, light, all. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=280.7s)]
*  She shares a story with nearly every person stepping off these buses. The faces are mostly [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=295.7s)]
*  women and children. The men had to stay and take up arms in Ukraine. A corner of this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=300.3s)]
*  quiet village now bustles with activity. To show the refugees they are welcome here. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=304.88s)]
*  Hungary hasn't been so friendly recently to outsiders, but not this time. A pop-up barbecue [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=311.0s)]
*  stand here to wave a friendly hello. And some of these helpers arrived only to realize they [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=318.68s)]
*  needed to stay. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=324.48s)]
*  They showed me pictures about their city and about the street. They don't have house anymore. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=325.92s)]
*  It has been bombed. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=333.52s)]
*  Gabor Prokaj came to drop off supplies from another distant village. He stayed for nine [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=334.72s)]
*  days. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=340.36s)]
*  You can't prepare yourself for this. You can't. You won't solve everything and every people's [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=341.48s)]
*  life. But you have to do one day four or five tasks which is done. And if it's okay, then [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=347.6s)]
*  your soul, your soul maybe will be okay. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=354.6s)]
*  Most of the people with whom we spoke planned to go someplace else in Europe. None planned [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=367.72s)]
*  to stay. There is only one place they want to be. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=372.12s)]
*  Do you want to go home? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=376.12s)]
*  Yeah, of course. I want to see my family. It's my family. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=377.32000000000005s)]
*  We are going now to Budapest and then we will make our cat's passport and then we will get [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=383.16s)]
*  to the airport. I know maybe tomorrow or in two days, three days. I don't know. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=394.68s)]
*  Do you believe that you can go home? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=401.68s)]
*  Of course. I believe it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=403.6s)]
*  A young Ukrainian refugee keeping hope alive that she will one day be able to return to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  her home. We'll be right back. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPnOYbm_7L8&t=415.08000000000004s)]
