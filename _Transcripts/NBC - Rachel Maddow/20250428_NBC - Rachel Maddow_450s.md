*  world? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  These policies on tariffs will hurt America standing in the world. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  So say Americans by a 34-point margin. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=187.36s)]
*  More than 2 to 1. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=191.08s)]
*  There's also a new NBC News survey monkey poll. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=193.72s)]
*  Same thing you'd expect broadly looking at all the other polling. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=197.2s)]
*  It all says the same thing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump underwater on essentially everything and on almost all issues. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  He is deeply underwater. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=205.04s)]
*  That is absolutely true in the new NBC News survey monkey poll as well. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=206.6s)]
*  Top line in that poll, approval of Trump is underwater minus 10. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  Approval of Elon Musk is underwater minus 18. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=217.16s)]
*  Yikes. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=220.28s)]
*  But they ask some of these questions in an interesting way and they give you ways to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=221.28s)]
*  parse them that are interesting. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=226.08s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=228.0s)]
*  This is the depth of feeling. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=229.0s)]
*  Just breaking out the people who are strongly approving or strongly disapproving of Trump [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  and Musk. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=236.84s)]
*  I mean, that's horrendous for them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=237.84s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=240.84s)]
*  Strongly approve is 26. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=241.84s)]
*  Strongly disapprove is 42. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=242.84s)]
*  On Musk, strongly favorable, 21. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=244.44s)]
*  Strongly unfavorable is 41. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=246.8s)]
*  There are a lot, a lot, a lot more people in this country who strongly disapprove of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=249.36s)]
*  Trump and Musk than there are people who really like them. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=253.52s)]
*  And let me, let me show you just one other interesting thing from this new NBC poll. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=258.56s)]
*  Which of the, this is great, which of the following emotions describes the, this is [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=263.16s)]
*  like a Pixar movie, which of the following emotions best describes how you are currently [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=268.92s)]
*  feeling about the actions the Trump administration has taken so far during its term. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=276.6s)]
*  And they give people this big, the big list of possible answers, the big list of emotions. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=281.44s)]
*  Thrilled, happy, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, angry or furious. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=285.96s)]
*  The number one answer for how you're feeling about Trump so far, number one answer is furious. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=291.44s)]
*  More than anything, people feel furious about Trump's actions thus far, 100 days into his [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=298.0s)]
*  presidency. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=304.35999999999996s)]
*  So you know what? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  It's not going great for the guy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  It's really not. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  I think Trump has started to realize that this public opinion stuff is going to be the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=308.88s)]
*  story of how his first 100 days have gone. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, heading into his first 100 days, today is like day 98, the headlines are like this. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=317.76s)]
*  Trump's approval at 100 days lower than any president in at least seven decades. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=324.56s)]
*  Yeah, how's it going big guy? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=329.28s)]
*  You can tell it's bugging him because he posted this online today. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=332.28s)]
*  He posted that the press, quote, cheats big on polls. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  Really, all of them? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=340.88s)]
*  He's ranting now he's calling the polls fake. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=344.0s)]
*  He says they're fake polls. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=346.28000000000003s)]
*  And he says he wants pollsters investigated for election fraud. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=348.24s)]
*  What election? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=354.48s)]
*  He says pollsters are, quote, sick. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=356.68s)]
*  He calls pollsters, quote, negative criminals. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=359.32s)]
*  What's a negative criminal? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=365.16s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  Is being a negative criminal better or worse than being a positive criminal? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  What's a negative criminal? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  And what crime are pollsters committing with their negative criminal fake election fraud [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=377.04s)]
*  poll fake stuff? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=384.44s)]
*  The president is very upset that the polls show that the country does not like him. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=387.32000000000005s)]
*  The country really, really does not like him and sees his first 100 days as a disaster. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=394.12s)]
*  He has had, in public opinion terms, he has had the most disastrous first 100 days of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=400.12s)]
*  any president since the dawn of modern polling. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=406.56s)]
*  No president has ever botched the first 100 days more badly than Donald Trump has botched [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=410.68s)]
*  it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=416.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's true not just for his approval rating generally and how people feel about [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  for every single thing you ask the American public about in terms of what he has done. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=422.12s)]
*  Do you like any of it? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhH8Pyhp_E4&t=427.88s)]
