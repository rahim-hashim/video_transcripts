# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Dec. 12
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [December 13, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs)
*  But here's something to keep an eye on when it comes to charges against January 6 defendants. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=0.0s)]
*  When you had those convictions of the oath keepers on seditious conspiracy, right, that's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=6.76s)]
*  the headline charge that got all the most attention and for good reason. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=12.4s)]
*  But when you got those seditious conspiracy convictions of two members of the oath keepers, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=16.42s)]
*  you should know that those two members of the oath keepers and also all of the other [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=21.5s)]
*  charged in that same trial, they were all also convicted of a different felony, obstructing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=25.8s)]
*  an official proceeding. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=32.8s)]
*  In other words, they were convicted of a felony charge for preventing Congress or trying to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=34.24s)]
*  prevent Congress from doing its job that day, which was certifying the presidential election. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=39.64s)]
*  And that charge obstructing an official proceeding that hasn't just been used against these [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=45.32s)]
*  organized paramilitary groups like the oath keepers. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  About 300 different defendants from January 6 have been charged under that specific felony [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=53.84s)]
*  statute obstruction of an official proceeding. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=60.2s)]
*  That specific statute obstruction of an official proceeding has it has also been seen by many [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  legal experts as one of the most likely felony charges that could be brought against Donald [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=67.84s)]
*  Trump himself if he were ever to be charged personally in connection with the January [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=74.5s)]
*  6 attack. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  That's why it's worth sort of memorizing that phrase obstruction of an official proceeding. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=82.0s)]
*  It's worth keeping an eye on that as a specific felony charge that has again been used hundreds [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=86.68s)]
*  of times and has has been used to get hundreds of convictions thus far against January 6 [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=91.72s)]
*  defendants. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=98.36s)]
*  Because in a Washington, D.C. federal appeals court today, a panel of three federal appeals [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=99.66s)]
*  court judges started considering whether that specific charge should essentially be nullified [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=104.72s)]
*  when it comes to January 6, whether it shouldn't be allowed to use that charge against January [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  6 defendants. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=115.68s)]
*  At a lower level at the district court level in the federal court system in D.C., there's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=117.8s)]
*  one Trump appointed judge who has ruled that that felony charge, that obstruction of an [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=121.4s)]
*  official proceeding charge can't be used against January 6 defendants. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=126.4s)]
*  Lots of other judges, including judges in that same federal court in that same D.C. district [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=132.0s)]
*  court have said it's fine to use that charge and in fact have overseen trials in which [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=136.84s)]
*  it has been used and it has been used to secure convictions. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=140.68s)]
*  But there is this one Trump judge who says it shouldn't be used. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  And when that Trump appointed judge ruled that way, the Justice Department appealed. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=148.76s)]
*  And so today it was the next highest level of court. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=154.16s)]
*  It was a federal appeals court, the D.C. circuit court of appeals, which heard oral arguments [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=156.12s)]
*  on whether or not that specific felony charge can essentially be obviated for January 6 [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=160.22s)]
*  defendants. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=167.6s)]
*  And that could have very wide consequences for everybody all the way down the line, not [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=168.6s)]
*  only people who have already been convicted of that charge, but people who are facing [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=172.16s)]
*  charges on that, facing that felony charge and potentially the consideration of whether [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=175.6s)]
*  or not a charge like that might be used against people who are at the very top of the alleged [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=182.78s)]
*  conspiracy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=186.72s)]
*  In addition to Congressman Ralph Norman of South Carolina calling for martial law, calling [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=189.68s)]
*  for the U.S. military to install Trump in power. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=195.28s)]
*  Even after January 6 happened, there's also a Republican congressman from Tennessee telling [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=198.88s)]
*  White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that Republican legislatures should just overrule [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  the vote in their states and proclaim Trump the winner. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  Congressman Mark Green of Tennessee told the White House Chief of Staff that should happen [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=213.28s)]
*  in various Republican controlled states because he described a guest on Newsmax as saying [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=217.22s)]
*  that was a legal possibility. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=223.32s)]
*  Also a North Carolina congressman pushing the same strategy, Congressman Greg Murphy [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=226.12s)]
*  of North Carolina, pushing the same strategy as Green, cut and pasted from a right-wing [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=231.24s)]
*  website in his case. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=235.6s)]
*  Also another North Carolina congressman suggesting to Mark Meadows, in this case it was Ted Budd [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=237.66s)]
*  of North Carolina, he suggested to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows that the voting [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=243.16s)]
*  machines had all been rigged by George Soros. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=247.56s)]
*  That congressman actually not only is going back to Congress, he's going back to Congress [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=251.52s)]
*  as a Senator because he just got promoted to U.S. Senator in last month's election [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=255.4s)]
*  in North Carolina, Ted Budd. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=260.32s)]
*  Also right-wing favorite congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona, he sent the White House [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  Chief of Staff a link to supposed evidence of election rigging. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=267.74s)]
*  He got this supposed evidence and he forwarded the citation to Mark Meadows in the White [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=272.36s)]
*  House. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=277.18s)]
*  The blog that he got the information was called Some Swear Word Told Me. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=278.34000000000003s)]
*  Word that starts with B and rhymes with Mitch. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=284.5s)]
*  Some Blank Told Me. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=286.98s)]
*  That's the name of the blog that he cited to the White House Chief of Staff to justify [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  whatever means were necessary to keep Trump in power. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=295.0s)]
*  Some B Told Me. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=298.44s)]
*  Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio texting a detailed plan for how Vice President Mike Pence could [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=301.66s)]
*  overturn the election and proclaim Trump to have been reelected when he wasn't. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=306.38s)]
*  Jim Jordan is expected to become chairman of the House Judiciary Committee next year. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=310.94s)]
*  And in lots of cases there's no record of Mark Meadows ever replying to these messages, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=317.7s)]
*  but in some cases he does. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=323.56s)]
*  And there are also references that suggest he was communicating with many of these members [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=325.44s)]
*  of Congress separately on encrypted messaging apps. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=328.78s)]
*  And those would be messages that as far as we know the January 6 investigation has not [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=332.34s)]
*  yet obtained. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=336.34s)]
*  Congressman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, he exchanged so many texts with Mark Meadows [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=339.06s)]
*  full of baroque conspiracy theories about Italian satellites rigging voting machines [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=343.11999999999995s)]
*  and the CIA director being in cahoots with the British government. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=348.62s)]
*  The British government? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=352.58s)]
*  To steal the election for Biden? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=354.21999999999997s)]
*  Why would the CIA work with the Brits to steal? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=356.05999999999995s)]
*  There was so much of that from Republican Congressman Scott Perry. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=359.22s)]
*  The Talking Points Memo has a whole separate article tonight dedicated just to Scott Perry's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=362.86s)]
*  texts to and from the White House Chief of Staff. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=368.06s)]
*  Congressman Scott Perry shares something called the House Freedom Caucus, which is a powerful [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=371.34000000000003s)]
*  group of far-right Republicans whose power is set to grow next year under the Republicans' [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=375.38s)]
*  razor-thin House majority. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=380.18s)]
*  It may also be the entity that determines who gets to be the next Republican speaker [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=382.3s)]
*  of the House. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=385.98s)]
*  We also reached out to Congressman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania for comment tonight, but we [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=387.92s)]
*  have not yet heard back. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=391.24s)]
*  Again, many of these text messages have been reported before, some of them in drips and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=393.72s)]
*  drops, but the difference tonight is that we now know, A, we can see all these text [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=397.56s)]
*  messages together, right? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=401.6s)]
*  But also these guys are going to be in charge of the U.S. Congress, in charge of the U.S. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=403.44s)]
*  House in just a few weeks. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  Which means, among other things, as I said, that the January 6 investigation which first [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=408.66s)]
*  unearthed these text messages, that's going to be shut down. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=413.04s)]
*  Because of course, if you were a Republican who had been involved in this stuff during [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=416.98s)]
*  the January 6 era, of course you would like to shut down that investigation. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=420.04s)]
*  So this was January 17th last year. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=425.92s)]
*  On January 17th last year, just to get your head around what was going on on that date, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=431.12s)]
*  that was just three days before Joe Biden was set to be inaugurated as the new president [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=435.94s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=440.56s)]
*  Monday was January 20th, this was January 17th. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=442.56s)]
*  Eleven days before January 17th was January 6th, when the pro-Trump mob stormed into Congress [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=446.8s)]
*  to try to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden's election as the new president. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=453.88s)]
*  So on January 17th last year, it is a week and a half since January 6th, and it is three [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=459.2s)]
*  days until the inauguration. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=464.98s)]
*  And on that date, January 17th, here is a text message that was sent to Donald Trump's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=467.52s)]
*  White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=472.28s)]
*  It says, quote, Mark, in seeing what's happening so quickly and reading about the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=475.0s)]
*  Dominion lawsuits attempting to stop any meaningful investigation, we are at a point of no return [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=479.79999999999995s)]
*  in saving our republic! [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=486.0s)]
*  Exclamation point, exclamation point. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=487.79999999999995s)]
*  Our, all caps, last hope is invoking martial law. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=489.71999999999997s)]
*  Please urge to president to do so. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  So three days before Joe Biden's inauguration, White House Chief of Staff is getting this [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=500.44s)]
*  text message urging President Trump to invoke martial law, spelled M-A-R-S-H-A-L-L. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=503.92s)]
*  Misspelled as if the person sending this law thinks there's a Marshall's law and maybe [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=511.72s)]
*  also a Ross dress for less law, possibly a T.J. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=515.66s)]
*  Maxx law that could be invoked as well. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=518.46s)]
*  What he means is martial law, M-A-R-T-I-A-L, as in suspend the Constitution and put the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=520.64s)]
*  military in charge to rule by force. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=526.62s)]
*  Our last hope is invoking martial law. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=530.22s)]
*  Please urge to president to do so. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=534.0400000000001s)]
*  This is three days before the inauguration. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=538.1s)]
*  Call out the troops, use military force, use weapons of war against the American public [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=540.62s)]
*  in order to stop the inauguration of the new president and instead put Trump in power. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=546.5400000000001s)]
*  And you know, this is a message not sent by the White House Chief of Staff. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=553.3000000000001s)]
*  It's a message sent to him. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=556.7s)]
*  So maybe you're thinking, you know, I bet the White House Chief of Staff gets all kinds [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=558.1s)]
*  of weird spam text messages from over eager Trump supporters. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=561.94s)]
*  I mean, whoever sent this doesn't even know how to spell martial law. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=565.38s)]
*  So how serious could this be? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=569.82s)]
*  But this text message was not from some rando who just guessed the phone number of the White [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=573.4200000000001s)]
*  House Chief of Staff. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=578.02s)]
*  No, this text message was from a sitting member of the United States Congress, Republican [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=579.02s)]
*  Congressman Ralph Norman of South Carolina. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=584.62s)]
*  On January 17th last year, three days before Biden's inauguration, Congressman Ralph [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=588.5s)]
*  Norman was texting Trump's White House Chief of Staff to urge President Trump to call out [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=594.1s)]
*  the U.S. military to use the military against civilians in order to keep Trump in power. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=599.2s)]
*  Congressman Norman was a sitting member of Congress when he sent that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=608.4s)]
*  He is still one now. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=611.5s)]
*  Congressman Norman was just reelected to Congress in South Carolina's 5th Congressional District, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=612.86s)]
*  and he was reelected by a lot. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=617.34s)]
*  He was reelected by like a two to one margin. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=618.34s)]
*  And marveling about the seditious radicalism of a member of Congress, somebody who wants [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=622.1800000000001s)]
*  to suspend the Constitution and keep their guy in power by force using military force [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=630.1800000000001s)]
*  to do it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=635.46s)]
*  I mean, marveling at some member of Congress being that far out there. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=636.46s)]
*  I mean, that's something we all get to do from time to time. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=640.22s)]
*  But right now, knowing this is what Ralph Norman was advocating for to the White House, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=643.9s)]
*  right, suspend the Constitution, put troops in the streets, take power by force, knowing [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=649.02s)]
*  he was advocating that is one thing. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=652.96s)]
*  Knowing that he and his party are going back to Congress as the new majority party there [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=655.42s)]
*  for next year, that feels like something different. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=660.26s)]
*  Because what are they going to do with their real power when they really have it? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=663.8199999999999s)]
*  So they did this thing where they carried around a big prop pipeline. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=669.1s)]
*  You might remember these images. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=672.22s)]
*  Here it was in front of the White House. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=674.34s)]
*  See the big pipeline, the big black pipeline? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=676.22s)]
*  Here it was in New York City. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=678.86s)]
*  For years, you'll remember this movement. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=681.66s)]
*  It was a big, well-organized, aggressively creative campaign to protest Keystone, the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=684.1800000000001s)]
*  expansion of the Keystone pipeline, which funneled tar sands oil out of Canada and across [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=689.98s)]
*  the United States. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=695.1800000000001s)]
*  Keystone is the most famous pipeline on the continent, specifically because of the movement [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=696.18s)]
*  to stop it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=700.14s)]
*  And the activists' argument against, particularly the Keystone XL pipeline expansion, was twofold. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=701.8599999999999s)]
*  And they said first, at this point in the climate crisis, we should be leaving tar [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=708.42s)]
*  sands oil in the ground, not building new funnels to help bring that stuff to market [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=711.42s)]
*  and burn it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=716.3s)]
*  But it was also a full-throated argument about how pipelines are not great at what they're [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=718.2399999999999s)]
*  supposed to do. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=723.18s)]
*  Anti-Keystone activists raised the alarm about how, for all the money in the oil industry, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=724.7s)]
*  even brand-new modern oil pipelines like to leak. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=730.86s)]
*  So first of all, keep the oil in the ground. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=736.7800000000001s)]
*  And if you don't do that and you put the oil in the pipeline, prepare for disastrous [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=740.34s)]
*  oil spills. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=744.22s)]
*  That was the argument from the anti-Keystone activists. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=745.7800000000001s)]
*  Well, what do you know? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=748.7s)]
*  Last week, the Keystone pipeline sprung a leak in Kansas the size of an Olympic swimming [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=751.86s)]
*  pool. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=756.5s)]
*  Close to 600,000 gallons of oil dumped out of the pipeline and into a nearby creek and [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=758.02s)]
*  into some rural pasture land. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=764.1800000000001s)]
*  It was the biggest oil spill on land in the United States in more than nine years. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=765.74s)]
*  And this is not the first time the Keystone pipeline has ruptured, not by a long shot, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=771.46s)]
*  including the spill from this past few days. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=775.86s)]
*  The Keystone pipeline has sprung a leak 23 times in the last 12 years. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=778.98s)]
*  And the leaks are getting bigger as they go. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=785.62s)]
*  More oil burst out of the pipeline in Kansas this past week than in all of the previous [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=787.74s)]
*  22 spills combined. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=792.3s)]
*  Keystone has now officially soaked the United States in more spilled oil than any other [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=795.22s)]
*  pipeline in the last decade. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=800.26s)]
*  Since it first got up and running in 2010, the Keystone pipeline has spilled so much [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=802.34s)]
*  oil that if you scooped up all of it and put it all in one gallon milk jugs, that line [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=806.9s)]
*  of milk jugs would stretch all the way from New York City to Philadelphia and beyond. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=813.18s)]
*  The company that runs the pipeline says with this new spill in Kansas, they say they're [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=820.5799999999999s)]
*  totally sure there's no threat to drinking water at all. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=823.9s)]
*  It's all going to be fine. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=827.22s)]
*  They say they've put out all the state of the art technologies to stop the spill from [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=828.74s)]
*  spreading further downstream and maybe even someday clean it up. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=832.9s)]
*  To be clear, the state of the art when it comes to cleaning up oil spills is pretty [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=837.66s)]
*  much what you might invent if you were a particularly unimaginative second grader thinking about [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=841.06s)]
*  things like this. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=846.26s)]
*  Cleaning up oil spills still looks like it did in the 60s. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=847.4599999999999s)]
*  It's like sections of boom and big paper towel thingies and sometimes vacuum trucks to try [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=850.42s)]
*  to slurp it up and dump it somewhere else. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=856.86s)]
*  Lobbying for oil drilling and for things like pipelines that spew oil all over Kansas, that's [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=861.2199999999999s)]
*  actually the state of the art in the oil industry. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=866.78s)]
*  That's like their Ferrari. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=869.06s)]
*  Cleaning up their spills, that technology is still very much their Model T Ford. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=870.78s)]
*  It's not like their priority for research and development is figuring out how to clean [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=875.66s)]
*  up when they spill. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=880.38s)]
*  The company that operates Keystone says they still don't know what caused this latest, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=883.38s)]
*  biggest spill. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=887.0999999999999s)]
*  It was all a big surprise to them. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=888.1s)]
*  It wasn't a surprise to everyone though. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTVx7auKVUs&t=890.1s)]
