# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: April 7
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 08, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA)
*  On this vote, the yeas are 53, the nays are 47, and this nomination is confirmed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=0.0s)]
*  You hear that? They're still going. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=15.0s)]
*  That went on for almost a minute before they were gaveled to order. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=18.0s)]
*  There was a sound from the floor in the gallery of the Senate after it voted 53 to 47 to confirm Judge Katanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=23.0s)]
*  The country's first black woman vice president announced the confirmation of the first black woman to become a Supreme Court justice. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=31.0s)]
*  The applause that followed was the sound of history made and progress sustained. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=39.0s)]
*  Nearly all of the 47 Republican senators who voted against Judge Jackson after working overtime to try to prevent her confirmation left the room as that sound grew louder. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=45.0s)]
*  Senator Mitt Romney stayed on his feet, applauding the moment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=56.0s)]
*  The senator was one of three Republicans who broke ranks with the party's rigid stance against Judge Jackson. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=61.0s)]
*  He voted yes based on the judge's merits, so he joined in the joy that filled the Senate chamber this afternoon. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=66.0s)]
*  Just ahead of the vote, Senator Warnock, the first black senator from the state of Georgia, explained that joy this way. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=73.0s)]
*  Mr. President, I rise today to express my joy in voting to confirm Judge Katanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=80.0s)]
*  What a great day it is for the United States of America, for our system of government, and the grand march toward the fulfillment of the sacred covenant we have with one another as an American people, e pluribus unum out of many. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=94.0s)]
*  One. Katanji Brown Jackson's improbable journey to the nation's highest court is a reflection of our own journey through fits and starts toward the nation's highest ideals. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=114.0s)]
*  She embodies the arc of our history. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=137.0s)]
*  Like my brother, Senator Booker, I know what it has taken for Judge Jackson to get to this moment, and nobody's going to steal my joy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=141.0s)]
*  Yes, I'm a senator. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=152.0s)]
*  I'm a pastor. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=156.0s)]
*  But beyond all of that, I'm the father of a young black girl. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=159.0s)]
*  I know how much it means for Judge Jackson to have navigated the double jeopardy of racism and sexism to now stand in the glory of this moment, in all of her excellence. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=165.0s)]
*  And Judge Jackson did stand in the glory of that moment with the president who nominated her to fill Justice Breyer's seat. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=184.0s)]
*  The two watched together as the votes came in. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=191.0s)]
*  They felt the arc of history bend. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=193.0s)]
*  We will get to hear from Judge Jackson tomorrow when she delivers remarks alongside President Biden and Vice President Harris. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=196.0s)]
*  This is what the vice president had to say about the vote today after she gaveled it in. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=203.0s)]
*  I'm overjoyed, deeply moved. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=209.0s)]
*  There is still so much yet to accomplish and that we can accomplish, including a day like today that is so historic and so important for so many reasons. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=213.0s)]
*  And I do believe is a very important statement about who we are as a nation, that we have just made a decision to put this extraordinary jurist on the highest court of our land. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=223.0s)]
*  It's a good statement about who we are. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=236.0s)]
*  It's a good statement about who we are. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=241.0s)]
*  It's also a reminder of who we have been and how we are still striving and sometimes succeeding to become more perfect. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=243.0s)]
*  After 233 years of Supreme Court rulings, there have been 115 justices. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=250.0s)]
*  108 were white men. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=256.0s)]
*  Five were women. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=258.0s)]
*  Two were black men. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=259.0s)]
*  And 31 years since the last black justice was confirmed, we will finally have a black woman justice, someone who is exceptionally qualified, highly respected, and will make the Supreme Court look just a bit more like the country it serves. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=260.0s)]
*  This is who we are today. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=277.0s)]
*  And that evolution matters. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=280.0s)]
*  It matters to the country and specifically to the black women who will now stand on Judge Jackson's shoulders as they become jurists, working to help make this union yet more perfect. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=282.0s)]
*  The New York Times spoke to women who are members of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, where Judge Jackson is an alumna. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=294.0s)]
*  It's a small group, fewer than 140 Harvard Law students are black. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=302.0s)]
*  84 are black women. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=306.0s)]
*  That's out of about 1,700 total students enrolled in the law program. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=308.0s)]
*  One of those 84 students, Mariah K. Watson, told the Times, quote, I'm grateful for the hard steps and all of the chipping away that Judge Jackson is doing right now so that the path is cleared or at least a little clearer for those who seek to come after her. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=312.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Mariah K. Watson, a third year law student at Harvard Law School and president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=330.0s)]
*  Ms. Watson, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=337.0s)]
*  I just have to ask you first, what was it like to see this today? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=340.0s)]
*  This was historic. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=345.0s)]
*  We were together as a group of law students. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=347.0s)]
*  Our external vice president, the Women's Law Students Association of Harvard came together to bring us a classroom to stream it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=351.0s)]
*  And so you can imagine the uproar in the room as students were elated, to say the very least, that a promise had been fulfilled and one of our very own has been nominated to the highest court in the land. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=358.0s)]
*  You told the New York Times that Judge Jackson has made the path a little clearer for those who seek to come after her. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=371.0s)]
*  I want to ask you about the path she had to walk, which included graduating from Harvard Law School, followed by years of experience on the bench, 24 hours of testimony very recently that questioned her record and her character. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=380.0s)]
*  This was her path to becoming an associate justice on the Supreme Court. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=392.0s)]
*  Tell me how you have digested this over the last several weeks. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=397.0s)]
*  It's been it's been complicated across the law school. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=402.0s)]
*  I think if you look at the other quotes, we know that she was amazing, not only the things that you mentioned, but she was on the law review. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=406.0s)]
*  She served not only on the federal circuit at the court of appeals level, but also as a district court judge for many years. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=414.0s)]
*  She knows the law backwards and forwards, and she has been excellent in every single thing that she has attempted to do. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=421.0s)]
*  And so part of the digesting is saying, well, you almost have to be without flaw. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=429.0s)]
*  And she is amazing. And we don't take away from that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=434.0s)]
*  But the way in which she had to be perfect, not only in her professional life, but also in her personal life, the deep in depth questions that they ask, nothing was off limits. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=437.0s)]
*  And so we now know this is what comes before us. If you want to ascend to this level and you are a black woman, then that means you're going to fight twice as hard to get there. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=447.0s)]
*  I want to talk about something that she said to Senator Alex Padilla of California that as a Harvard student, she once asked herself, do I belong here? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=457.0s)]
*  Can I make it in this environment? It's a lot of language we're hearing now about who belongs in spaces. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=467.0s)]
*  And that includes the Supreme Court or where you are at Harvard Law School, places where there are relatively few black women. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=473.0s)]
*  Who needs to see that people who look like Judge Jackson belong in those spaces? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=481.0s)]
*  The woman who might follow her path or is it the 47 senators who voted against her? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=486.0s)]
*  Who needs the proof that she's had to provide? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=492.0s)]
*  I think it's both. I think it's the women who are trying to follow in her footsteps as we look across the classroom or even walking on the halls and seeing the portraits of professors that don't look like us. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=495.0s)]
*  And we're reading opinions by people who did not live our lives and don't reflect who we are. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=507.0s)]
*  And you're wondering, am I meant to be here? Is this the right place for me? And where does success lead? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=512.0s)]
*  So I think part of it is is knowing that as black women, as black people, and as just women in general on campus, that we can ascend to these levels. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=518.0s)]
*  And now we have a role model. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=527.0s)]
*  But I think it's equally important for the 47 senators who voted no and the people who maybe share similar ideologies for why they voted no to see that black women can be brilliant, can be fair, and can function at the highest levels and do it really, really well. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=530.0s)]
*  And I think that's something that needs to be seen. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=550.0s)]
*  I think there are a lot of assumptions that we don't always talk about around what it means to succeed and be brilliant when you are a part of a marginalized community. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=552.0s)]
*  And I think showing her credentials and her amazingness that she's going to bring to the court is going to help to hopefully chip away at some of those assumptions. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=561.0s)]
*  You've done something that many of us have not done. You've met Judge Jackson in person. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=572.0s)]
*  Can you share a little bit about that experience and in particular her willingness to make herself available to aspiring young lawyers? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=576.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Judge Jackson, now Justice Jackson, or soon to be, regularly visited Harvard Law School. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=583.0s)]
*  And I had the good fortune of meeting her in the fall of 2019. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=591.0s)]
*  She came to speak to the Black Lawsons Association in a lunch. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=596.0s)]
*  And she talked to us about diversity in the judiciary. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=600.0s)]
*  And she answered every single question that we as bright-eyed Bushitele 1Ls had about what it meant to be here and how she persevered in her classroom when she didn't feel represented or she felt like she couldn't speak on things that she really cared about, or how did she make herself known on campus? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=604.0s)]
*  And she talked about the importance of legal writing. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=623.0s)]
*  She talked about the importance of understanding the law and having an intimate command of the doctrine. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=625.0s)]
*  And she talked about how to show up even when you don't feel like you can. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=631.0s)]
*  And she talked about how she did it. And it's just an amazing opportunity. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=636.0s)]
*  She also talked to us about moot court competitions and the ways that we could show our beautiful, brilliant Black community and spaces, not just in our organization. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=640.0s)]
*  What an experience to have met her and to have heard her speak. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=653.0s)]
*  Mariah, thank you for joining us. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=656.0s)]
*  Mariah K. Watson is a third-year law student at Harvard Law School and the president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=658.0s)]
*  We're grateful for your time and for sharing your experiences with us tonight. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=664.0s)]
*  Today, Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, was pressed in an interview with Sky News about evidence that Russian soldiers killed civilians in Buche, Ukraine. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=671.0s)]
*  Peskov is presented with satellite imagery, geo-located video evidence, witness testimony compiled by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=681.0s)]
*  But he insists it is all fake, a bold fake made by Ukrainians in conjunction with private satellite imagery companies, all Western media and Western governments, all to make Russia look bad. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=689.0s)]
*  As of last night, Ukrainian officials had counted 320 civilian casualties in Buche alone. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=702.0s)]
*  The mayor there saying that almost 90 percent of those found dead had bullet wounds, not shrapnel wounds, meaning they had been individually targeted. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=708.0s)]
*  No matter how much evidence it is presented with, the Russian government continues to deny everything, to say it's all fake. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=717.0s)]
*  Now, today, the German publication Der Spiegel has reported new evidence that will be hard for Russia to deny. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=724.0s)]
*  Radio traffic intercepted by Germany's Foreign Intelligence Service of Russian troops discussing the murder of civilians. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=732.0s)]
*  Quote, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=740.0s)]
*  The radio traffic makes it seem as though the atrocities perpetuated on civilians in Buche were neither random acts nor the product of individual soldiers who got out of hand. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=741.0s)]
*  Rather, the material suggests that the troops spoke of the atrocities as though they were simply discussing their everyday lives. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=752.0s)]
*  Some of the intercepted traffic apparently matches the locations of bodies found along the main road through Buche. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=761.0s)]
*  End quote. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=767.0s)]
*  In one clip, the newspaper says, a soldier apparently told another that they had just shot a person on a bicycle. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=768.0s)]
*  In another, a man apparently said, first you interrogate soldiers, then you shoot them. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=775.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Melanie Amman, who in addition to being the lead byline on this reporting today is the Berlin bureau chief for Der Spiegel and a member of the paper's editorial leadership. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=782.0s)]
*  Ms. Amman, thank you for making the time to be with us tonight. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=792.0s)]
*  I want to start by asking you a bit about this intercepted audio. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=795.0s)]
*  How much audio is there? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=799.0s)]
*  How many different conversations were there and what are the kinds of things that you can hear being discussed on it? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=800.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=807.0s)]
*  Our sources have told us that there was a briefing of the Foreign Intelligence Service of Germany, which is abbreviated BND. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=809.0s)]
*  And they were briefing members of parliament in a classified session about the radio traffic they have intercepted from Russian troops. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=818.0s)]
*  The exact number, I can't tell you, but they apparently did read a few of these intercepts to the politicians with quite a shocking content [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=828.0s)]
*  where the Russian soldiers were exchanging basically hints and information how they were treating the civilians in Ukraine and committing murder, committing all kinds of atrocities, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=837.0s)]
*  like saying, for example, like we first we interrogate them, then we shoot them. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=849.0s)]
*  And now this is, of course, the report that our sources gave to us. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=854.0s)]
*  We have not personally been able to listen to these intercepts, but the sources accounts do line up. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=857.0s)]
*  It's quite shocking, actually. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=864.0s)]
*  And beyond being possible evidence of war crimes by individual soldiers, one of the things that you write about is that the reason this audio is so significant is because it could be used as evidence that these may not have been rogue independent actors, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=866.0s)]
*  but rather soldiers carrying out orders as part of a plan. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=881.0s)]
*  Help us understand what you have reported on that demonstrates that. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=885.0s)]
*  Exactly. I think it's hard to underestimate the value of these intercepts when it comes to analyzing the military strategy of the Russian army that indeed they were like the atrocities committed, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=891.0s)]
*  the killings are not just random acts of violence of people acting out or maybe acting under the stress of war or whatever, living out their horrible fantasies. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=904.0s)]
*  But it's actually really a coldly calculated method that has been spread through a big part of the Russian army. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=916.0s)]
*  And the political relevance is also that these intercepts dismantle this narrative, the propaganda of the Russian government, of the Kremlin, that like not only are the pictures fake, these people were not killed by Russian troops. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=923.0s)]
*  And like the whole propaganda is thrumbling. If you have people saying on record soldiers saying on record, this is how you treat the civilians in this country. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=937.0s)]
*  And like for shooting at a guy on a bicycle, things like this. And so this this is what makes these intercepts so important. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=947.0s)]
*  The there can be signals intelligence that's used to match to the satellite images to identify specific perpetrators. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=955.0s)]
*  And that could be important in building a war crimes case. But there's added significance because some of the audio, not all of it, has been traced to the region north of Kiev where Bucca is located. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=965.0s)]
*  But there's also there also seems to be audio out of other cities. How do you understand that? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=976.0s)]
*  Yes, there is also apparently audio transmissions from the region of Mario poll and from other parts of the country. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=983.0s)]
*  But especially from, like you said, the region in the north of Kiev of the nation's capital, where we know that atrocities have been committed. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=992.0s)]
*  So the pieces of the puzzle add up. But it's we we are confronted with actual proof that the people who were there may have committed these atrocities. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1001.0s)]
*  So they might be very valuable in a court of law. I want to go back to the beginning of this. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1011.0s)]
*  You said you're right that the audio was intercepted by German intelligence. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1016.0s)]
*  Do you have some sense of how they intercepted it and whether they're working with other nations to do so? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1020.0s)]
*  I do, actually. It's the interesting thing is that so far our foreign intelligence service in this very war and this crisis has not proved as valuable as, for example, your American services, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1027.0s)]
*  because the intelligence provided and the analysis of this intelligence by the German services has been flawed. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1039.0s)]
*  They have underestimated the war. So but with these intercepts, suddenly they they really are ahead of the crowd, ahead of the pack, if you want, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1046.0s)]
*  because, ironically, they are using a technique, they're using an infrastructure that is from the Cold War. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1055.0s)]
*  They're using these antennas 30 meters high that are located in Bavaria and which other European countries have long dismantled since the Cold War. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1062.0s)]
*  This infrastructure has been there for decades and it's used to transmit the shortwave transmissions by the Russian army. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1074.0s)]
*  But after the Soviet times, many countries thought, well, we don't need this anymore. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1081.0s)]
*  The Germans kept it since we're orderly and we stick to what we have. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1085.0s)]
*  And also we've always poorly financed our both our military and our security services. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1090.0s)]
*  I guess this is why this clunky rusty stuff is still around. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1096.0s)]
*  And now it's proved extremely valuable because we can listen in on what the Russian troops are discussing on their shortwave transmissions. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1100.0s)]
*  That is a remarkable story. Your entire reporting on this is remarkable. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1107.0s)]
*  Melanie, thank you for being with us. Melanie Amman is the Berlin bureau chief for Der Spiegel and the lead byline on this important piece of reporting. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1111.0s)]
*  We thank you for your time tonight. Thanks for having me. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1118.0s)]
*  Shortly before announcing Katanji Brown Jackson's historic confirmation vote, Vice President Harris did something that was rather unexpected. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1123.0s)]
*  Take a look at this. You can see on the left hand side of your screen, she pulled out a little bit of a red dot. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1131.0s)]
*  On the right hand side of your screen, she pulled out a few pieces of paper. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1136.0s)]
*  It turns out that was vice presidential stationary and she proceeded to hand it over to the only two black Democrats in the Senate, Senators Cory Booker and Raphael Warnock. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1139.0s)]
*  Apparently, the vice president told them she had an assignment. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1150.0s)]
*  She wanted each of them to write a letter to a young black woman in their life as a way of commemorating this date in history. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1152.0s)]
*  Senator Raphael Warnock has shared the letter that he wrote. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1160.0s)]
*  It is addressed to his daughter Chloe and it reads, Today we confirmed Katanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1163.0s)]
*  In our nation's history, she is the first Supreme Court justice who looks like you with hair like yours. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1170.0s)]
*  While we were voting on the floor of the Senate, a friend of mine, the vice president of the United States, handed me this piece of paper and suggested I write a letter to someone who comes to mind. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1177.0s)]
*  By the way, she is the first vice president who also looks like you. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1187.0s)]
*  So I wrote this note to say you can be anything, achieve anything you set your head and your heart to do. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1192.0s)]
*  Love you, Dad. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GwLYWl8yA&t=1199.0s)]
