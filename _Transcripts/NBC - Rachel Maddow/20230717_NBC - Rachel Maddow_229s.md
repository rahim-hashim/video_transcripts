# Trump's collision course: GA Supreme Court rejects Trump effort to derail election probe
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [July 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA)
*  So, officially, this is the Tom-Morland interchange in Atlanta, Georgia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=0.0s)]
*  But the locals call it Spaghetti Junction because it looks like an overturned bowl of spaghetti. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=5.04s)]
*  It's a five-level stack of intertwining interchanges where Interstate 85 and Interstate 285 intersect [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=10.08s)]
*  and go bananas. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=17.28s)]
*  It is possible that the complexity of this intersection is about to be undone, or at [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=20.76s)]
*  least outdone, as the most complicated intersection in Atlanta. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=26.28s)]
*  Because tomorrow is due to be the first big pretrial hearing in former President Trump's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  classified documents case in federal court. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  We're expecting the judge in that federal case to set a schedule for that federal criminal [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=40.24s)]
*  trial maybe tomorrow or sometime shortly thereafter. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=44.88s)]
*  On top of that, though, today the Georgia State Supreme Court unanimously rejected an [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  effort by Trump to get a Georgia prosecutor off his case. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=54.6s)]
*  This is Georgia District Attorney Fannie Willis, who's been investigating efforts by Trump [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=58.24s)]
*  to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  Last week, you may remember, she impaneled two grand juries. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=65.84s)]
*  One of those grand juries is expected to consider the historic question of whether to indict [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=68.8s)]
*  anyone in this case, including whether to indict Trump himself. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=73.44s)]
*  Willis has all but made explicit that she anticipates announcing the grand jury's indictment decision [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=78.12s)]
*  sometime between the last day of this month, July 31st and August 18th. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=83.0s)]
*  These would be possible state level charges, potentially serious ones. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=88.16s)]
*  But coming in from the southbound on-ramp could be federal special counsel Jack Smith [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=93.44s)]
*  with his own charges along the same lines. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=99.84s)]
*  Because in addition to bringing criminal charges against Trump in the classified documents [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=102.36s)]
*  case, a case for which we might get a trial scheduled tomorrow, Jack Smith has also been [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  running this other federal investigation into Trump's role in the January 6th attack [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=110.88s)]
*  and overturning the results of the election and the whole fake electors scheme, potentially [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=115.52s)]
*  even his fundraising off the fake stolen election claims. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=119.56s)]
*  That part of Smith's investigation seems like it might overlap and crisscross with the state [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  level of state level investigation of many of the same things that's happening in Atlanta. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=129.8s)]
*  And that raises interesting questions about timing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=135.7s)]
*  The charge of prosecutor Fonny Willis' indictment really may be imminent. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=138.04s)]
*  Legal experts say if there are federal charges on a similar matter, you would expect the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=143.12s)]
*  federal court to take precedence. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  But that's all going to come together very soon. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=151.12s)]
*  So just in terms of timing, that may all come to a bumper car collision before we know it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  And if that's not enough, if that has you feeling like all the Trump world investigations [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=158.38s)]
*  and indictments are tangled up with each other like somebody spilled the spaghetti, you're [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  not wrong because to add further complication, it now looks like there are two other states [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=166.76s)]
*  that have opened state level criminal investigations into the fake electors part of the scheme, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  both in Michigan and in Arizona. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=178.88s)]
*  If those result in charges, well, yeah, the calendar is going to get complicated here. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  The calendar already is complicated if you are lawyering for Donald J. Trump. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=187.92s)]
*  And God bless you if you are. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=192.76s)]
*  Each individual prosecutor can pursue their investigation at their own pace. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=195.12s)]
*  But once they decide to go to court, they are going to have to put on a blinker and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=199.08s)]
*  merge with all the other prosecutors. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=202.88s)]
*  Spaghetti Junction just ahead. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLTNvXDP4BA&t=208.16s)]
