# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: March 14
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [March 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE)
*  I want to play you a clip of a segment that aired on Russian state-controlled TV station [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=0.0s)]
*  NTV over the weekend. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=5.12s)]
*  It was a segment about the completely false conspiracy theory that there are U.S.-funded [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=7.82s)]
*  biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=12.86s)]
*  Part of the Russian network's evidence for the existence of these weapons labs were clips [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=16.64s)]
*  from Fox News with U.S. elected officials like the Republican Senator Ron Johnson and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=21.0s)]
*  the former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard claiming that the U.S. hasn't been [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=26.68s)]
*  telling the full truth about this issue. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Here's another Russian TV segment from this weekend where a different Russian TV network [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=34.8s)]
*  just played a huge chunk of Tucker Carlson's Fox News show translated into Russian. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=39.56s)]
*  I have to play a second for you with the sound on because the Russian translator tries to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=45.16s)]
*  mimic Tucker's performance while speaking. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  It's quite funny. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=53.06s)]
*  If Ukraine has biological weapons, Ukraine has objects for biological research. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=56.06s)]
*  What? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  Other than being very funny, it's also deeply concerning. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=66.66s)]
*  You see the banner under there, Under Secretary of State, Ukraine has bio labs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=69.34s)]
*  Now what Carlson is doing in this segment is taking a statement from Victoria Newland, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=75.76s)]
*  the U.S. Under Secretary of State, completely out of context. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=80.62s)]
*  He's confirming that the U.S. does have biological laboratories in Ukraine like we have all over [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=84.86s)]
*  the world, labs that work like the CDC to monitor diseases and to prevent outbreaks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=90.42s)]
*  They're not weapons labs. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=95.42s)]
*  But look at how far Carlson took that from its actual context. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=97.62s)]
*  Here's the clip that I just played for you originally in English. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=101.82s)]
*  Under oath in an open committee hearing, Toria Newland just confirmed that the Russian disinformation [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=107.7s)]
*  they've been telling us for days is a lie and a conspiracy theory and crazy and immoral [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=113.14s)]
*  to believe is in fact totally and completely true. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=116.44s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=121.3s)]
*  Whoa, indeed. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=124.3s)]
*  What Carlson is saying there is not true. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=126.86s)]
*  There are no biological weapons labs in Ukraine, let alone bio weapons labs funded by the U.S. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=129.0s)]
*  But we now know, thanks to reporting out of Mother Jones, that Tucker Carlson's show falls [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  so in line with the fake narrative the Kremlin is trying to push that the Kremlin actually [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=139.84s)]
*  sent out a memo to Russian media outlets instructing them to literally play more of it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=144.96s)]
*  It is essential to use as much as possible fragments of broadcasts of the popular Fox [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=152.44s)]
*  News host Tucker Carlson. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=158.72s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=161.32s)]
*  It's been deeply alarming watching Russians and Chinese controlled state media go all [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=162.32s)]
*  in on this fake bio lab story. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=167.96s)]
*  It's a level of propaganda coordination that we've never seen before between those two [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=170.84s)]
*  nations and it's all the more alarming now that U.S. officials are warning that all this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  talk about these Ukrainian bio weapons labs might be a pretext for Russia using chemical [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=180.38s)]
*  or biological weapons of their own in Ukraine. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  That's a huge concern given all of the allegations of war crimes that have already been committed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=189.72s)]
*  We also have this new and honestly hard to believe concern at home in the United States [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=194.76s)]
*  because U.S. conservative media has become at best a useful idiot for Russian propaganda. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=199.04s)]
*  Tucker Carlson is the most visible piece of that but he's just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=206.44s)]
*  The larger piece of all of this conspiracy theory, it's coming from the underbelly of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=210.84s)]
*  the internet, a place that most of us do our best not to spend time in. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=216.68s)]
*  I hope you don't. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=220.44s)]
*  I certainly don't. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=221.44s)]
*  But luckily we have NBC senior reporter Ben Collins who is willing to spend a ton of time [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=222.6s)]
*  in the dark weird corners of the internet for us. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=227.8s)]
*  Joining us now, Ben Collins, NBC News senior reporter. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=231.0s)]
*  He covers what he calls the dystopia beat. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=233.84s)]
*  Ben, thank you for being with us tonight. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=236.28s)]
*  This one is deeply alarming. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=238.76s)]
*  You have covered a lot of garbage on the internet but this one is alarming because you have [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=240.52s)]
*  described how these things sort of start on the underbelly of the internet. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=244.44s)]
*  They work their way up to Fox News and then they spread out, now being used by the Russians [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=248.0s)]
*  and the Chinese to justify some things that they are doing or might do in Ukraine. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=252.76s)]
*  Yeah, let's be very clear about this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=258.24s)]
*  This specific conspiracy theory started in the English speaking American far right on [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=261.28s)]
*  a website called Gab. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=267.44s)]
*  Eight days before the invasion, there was a user that posted the bio labs that they [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=269.48s)]
*  said were all over Ukraine that were being used in their eyes to build bio weapons. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=275.32s)]
*  Now these are research facilities. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  They are not creating bio weapons there for the United States government but it fit into [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=280.88s)]
*  that larger narrative that made sense in the far right that Anthony Fauci is building bio [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=285.32s)]
*  weapons and releasing them all throughout the world to create the coronavirus to lock [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=290.44s)]
*  the world down. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=293.79999999999995s)]
*  All that stuff. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  It made a lot of sense. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  The problem is the Russians hadn't really thought of this conspiracy theory before the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  invasion. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=299.84s)]
*  You know, before the invasion, they didn't talk about it at all. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=300.84s)]
*  Until the 24th, the day they invaded Ukraine, the American far right seized on this bio [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=304.64s)]
*  labs conspiracy theory. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=309.84s)]
*  In fact, you know, they weren't really taking to this denazification narrative. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=311.36s)]
*  So they were turning on Vladimir Putin in the far right and the QAnon spaces as well. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  But this bio lab conspiracy switched everything around. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=321.96s)]
*  In the last week, they have turned back to being effectively pro Vladimir Putin in the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=325.44s)]
*  QAnon and pro Trump spaces. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=330.36s)]
*  And then Russian propaganda took that American propaganda that was created in these far right [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=332.32s)]
*  spaces in the QAnon forums and on GAB and made it their own. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  Let's talk about it reminds us of the theories that COVID-19 was deliberately started in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=345.24s)]
*  a lab and spread out. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=351.0s)]
*  Does this start and live in those kinds of places? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that account on GAB was an anti-vax accounts. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=356.28000000000003s)]
*  That's the remaining legacy of the anti-vax spaces on the Internet. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=360.44s)]
*  They are conforming to be part of the broader global far right to push these conspiracy [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=364.92s)]
*  theories against the Bidens, against Anthony Fauci and against what they would call the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  medical establishment all throughout the world. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  The global far right has coalesced around that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=377.08s)]
*  And it's worked for Russia, too. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=379.56s)]
*  And in fact, you know, the TASS, the Russian news agency, they didn't post anything about [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=381.48s)]
*  biological weapons attacks that were created in Ukraine in the run up in the one month [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=387.56s)]
*  before the invasion in Ukraine. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=393.4s)]
*  But on Thursday and Friday, they posted 24 separate articles about what they called biological [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=395.96s)]
*  weapons in Ukraine. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=401.48s)]
*  This was this has become their pretext for this war. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=402.92s)]
*  And it's stemmed from the American anti-vax communities in the American QAnon communities. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=407.64s)]
*  We've seen Fox News and their personalities get behind some very unusual things prior to this war. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=413.08s)]
*  This trucker protest in Canada, something that was really egged on by far right media, but [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=419.48s)]
*  including Fox News. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=424.44s)]
*  At some point, when the Russians, the Russian government starts telling Russian state media [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=425.24s)]
*  to quote and continue to use run clips from Tucker Carlson and Fox News, does Fox have [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  some response to that? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=437.24s)]
*  Are they out there saying, hey, whoa, hold on a second. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=438.2s)]
*  This is not meant to be stuff that goes into Russian propaganda. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=441.16s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=448.12s)]
*  Not that we've heard. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=448.6s)]
*  However, I will say that there's going to be a line at some point between the real reporters [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=449.48s)]
*  who are in Ukraine getting hurt. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=454.36s)]
*  There was an injured reporter for Fox News in Ukraine today in the people who are aligning [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=456.44s)]
*  with the crisis actor, people who are saying, you know, this this invasion is justified or [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=462.6s)]
*  that this this invasion isn't really happening at all, which is a sort of choose your own [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=467.88s)]
*  adventure that's happening from Russian propaganda right now. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=471.88s)]
*  So eventually, I'm pretty sure those reporters who are in these cities getting shelled and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=475.08s)]
*  watching children die in the street will want to step up and tell their colleague over there at [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=480.36s)]
*  Fox News in his cabin in Maine that maybe this is realer than he wants to let on to his audience. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=486.12s)]
*  This would be a good night to do it, given that the State Department reporter for Fox News has [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=493.24s)]
*  been injured by shelling in in Russia as you in Ukraine. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  As you say, Ben, thanks very much for your reporting. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=502.04s)]
*  Ben Collins, NBC News senior reporter. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=503.96000000000004s)]
*  We appreciate your time as always. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=505.8s)]
*  In Russia, viewers who tuned into tonight's evening newscast of the country's largest [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=508.52000000000004s)]
*  state run broadcast news channel saw this on their screens. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=512.6s)]
*  That sign under no war reads, stop the war. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  Don't believe propaganda. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=520.6s)]
*  They're lying to you here. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=521.88s)]
*  The woman holding that sign reportedly chanted stop the war. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=523.56s)]
*  No to war. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=527.4s)]
*  Now, the state run network quickly cut to some other footage and the woman who is reportedly [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=529.4s)]
*  an editor at the network and said in a pre-recorded message that she is ashamed to work for the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=533.16s)]
*  Kremlin propaganda station was quickly arrested. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=538.28s)]
*  And she knew she would be arrested because 10 days ago, Russia passed and implemented [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=542.28s)]
*  a new law that says anyone who refers to the, quote, special military operation in Ukraine [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=547.64s)]
*  as a war or an invasion could get up to 15 years in prison. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=552.92s)]
*  Now, in the past several days, Putin has gone to even more extreme lengths to cut off Russia [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=556.92s)]
*  from the rest of the world. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=561.8s)]
*  You can't access Facebook or Instagram. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=563.4s)]
*  There's restricted access to Twitter. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=565.72s)]
*  Russia controlled media calls reports about the war fake news. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=568.04s)]
*  And if you're in Russia, well, you will not be able to get to the war. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=571.88s)]
*  If you're in Russia, well, you will not see photos of innocent women and children who've [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=575.56s)]
*  just been slaughtered. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=579.9599999999999s)]
*  You will not see this tragic image of a woman being evacuated from the maternity hospital [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=581.7199999999999s)]
*  that was bombed last week in Mariupol. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=587.2399999999999s)]
*  We learned today that the woman and her baby did not make it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=590.04s)]
*  But you're shielded from that in Russia. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=594.1199999999999s)]
*  If you somehow did see those images in Russia and decided that you stand against that destruction, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=596.52s)]
*  if you dared to take to the streets and protest the invasion, well, you'll be put in prison. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=602.84s)]
*  It's been reported that nearly 15,000 people have been arrested in Russia since February 24th for [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=608.28s)]
*  the mere crime of protesting. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=614.2s)]
*  Just this weekend, this person was arrested for holding up a blank protest sign. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=615.88s)]
*  Over 800 people were arrested just this weekend. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=622.04s)]
*  Well, now some people from across the globe are trying to get around that information [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=625.5600000000001s)]
*  chokehold to get a message to the people of Russia to deliver them the truth. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=628.92s)]
*  And they're getting awfully creative. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=634.5999999999999s)]
*  An online campaign to get information to Russian-led people to flood Google and TripAdvisor [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=636.4399999999999s)]
*  reviews of restaurants in Russia. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=641.8s)]
*  One person reviewed a Russian restaurant in Moscow saying, quote, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=644.68s)]
*  Your government is lying to you about the conflict in Ukraine. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=647.88s)]
*  It's not a rescue operation. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=650.92s)]
*  There are no Nazis there. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=652.4399999999999s)]
*  In Norway, a computer expert launched a website that has led thousands of people to volunteer [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=654.84s)]
*  their time and send millions of spam emails to Russians urging them to oppose the war. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  The website allows users to get around Russia's strict online censorship [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=667.08s)]
*  restrictions in an effort to get the truth out there. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=671.16s)]
*  Efforts to censor and use misinformation to block Russians for learning what Putin [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=674.68s)]
*  is truly doing are picking up steam. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=679.56s)]
*  Joining me from Kiev now is that member of parliament, Alex Goncharenko. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=682.36s)]
*  Mr. John Goncharenko, thank you for joining us. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=686.92s)]
*  It's good to talk to you again. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=689.72s)]
*  Just a few days ago, Russian forces bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=691.4s)]
*  You've called this latest strike that we were just watching on an apartment building in [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=695.88s)]
*  Kiev by Russian artillery, an example, in your words, of genocide in the 21st century. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=700.12s)]
*  Now that's a very serious allegation. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=706.28s)]
*  Are you, are you, do you believe that Russian forces are deliberately and specifically targeting civilians? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=709.3199999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=716.6s)]
*  It couldn't be so many mistakes. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=717.8s)]
*  Kindergarten, schools, hospitals, more than 200 schools are hit by Russians. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=719.8s)]
*  Even you said about Mariupol and maternity house, one of women who were injured that time, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=726.12s)]
*  pregnant woman, she died with her unborn child. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=733.24s)]
*  That's an awful catastrophe. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=737.32s)]
*  And now you see these absolutely residential building. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=739.32s)]
*  And today there were three bombings in Kiev and all three of them were just in areas without [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=742.6s)]
*  any military target. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=748.5200000000001s)]
*  So it cannot be so many mistakes. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=750.12s)]
*  No, it's absolutely tactics and strategic plan of Putin because he just can't win at our army. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=752.5200000000001s)]
*  And that's why he started this terror against civilians. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=761.6400000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about the civilians. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=768.2s)]
*  We on this side out here in Hungary and my colleagues in Poland have spoken to many of [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=769.8000000000001s)]
*  the refugees who have fled the country for their safety and that of their children. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=774.36s)]
*  What about those people who have stayed, particularly in Kiev, a city that is getting [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=778.9200000000001s)]
*  closer and closer to being surrounded by Russian troops? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=782.84s)]
*  What are you hearing from the people who are, who have stayed and are remaining there? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=786.44s)]
*  Certainly people are concerned. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=792.12s)]
*  Certainly people worry. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=793.6400000000001s)]
*  But many of them join joint civil guards, civilian militia, me included, and took weapons [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=795.4s)]
*  in their arms ready to defend the city. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=803.3199999999999s)]
*  Some of them do not want to leave their apartments. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=806.4399999999999s)]
*  Some of them don't have a possibility to leave their apartments. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=809.8s)]
*  Many elderly people are staying still in Kiev. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=814.4399999999999s)]
*  So more than one million people are now in Kiev and certainly they are concerned. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=817.8s)]
*  And everybody sees what had happened with Mariupol, with Kharkiv. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=824.04s)]
*  That's why we are so desperately asking for support to stop Russian aircraft. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=828.76s)]
*  We need aircraft. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=835.24s)]
*  We are asking for air defense system, Patriots, most stingers, things like this. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=836.68s)]
*  We are not asking for NATO pilots. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=841.88s)]
*  We can do everything ourselves, but please give us instruments to defend our women and [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=844.36s)]
*  children and to defend the whole free world. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=850.36s)]
*  One of the things we have heard of is people coming across to these other NATO countries [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=854.04s)]
*  or Eastern European countries, dropping their children off, sending them off to be taken [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=859.4s)]
*  care of by friends or relatives, and then going back into Ukraine because of what you [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=864.28s)]
*  said, elderly parents. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=869.4s)]
*  There are a lot of elderly people who are not mobile still in Kiev. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=871.48s)]
*  As the city gets surrounded, we have heard that it could take 10 days to two weeks to [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=875.9599999999999s)]
*  surround the city and then 10 days to two weeks for Kiev to run out of critical supplies. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=879.72s)]
*  What, tell us what you believe happens then. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=884.76s)]
*  What happens once the Russians have surrounded you and you don't have the air support that [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=887.48s)]
*  you're asking the West for? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=891.24s)]
*  First of all, even without these air support, I just want to remind you that Putin was [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=894.12s)]
*  thinking that he would take Kiev in two days. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=902.84s)]
*  Then an American official said to American journalists that they were given 96 hours [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=905.8000000000001s)]
*  to Ukraine and after this we will fail. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=912.36s)]
*  As you see now, it's almost 20 days and we have not failed and I'm sure we will not fail. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=915.32s)]
*  And Putin could not and he will not encircle Kiev. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=922.2s)]
*  So I believe that our army, which is holding the ground, will hold it for future if they [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=928.36s)]
*  will penetrate to the city. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=934.6s)]
*  People like me, civilian militia will fight them on the street. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=935.96s)]
*  But I believe that we will not need to do this. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=939.8000000000001s)]
*  And I am absolutely sure that the victory will be ours because it is our land and when [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=942.6s)]
*  we are, our plan is to stay till the end. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=951.48s)]
*  And when you have moral like this, you cannot lose. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=955.08s)]
*  I've spoken to members of parliament every single day. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=960.52s)]
*  Some of them have never held a gun in their lives. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=962.84s)]
*  They've got a firearm. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=965.08s)]
*  They've learned how to use it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=967.1600000000001s)]
*  You are wearing your civilian militia uniform. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=968.6s)]
*  Tell me what it's like being a member of parliament and being a member of the militia. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=971.8000000000001s)]
*  What is your life like now with these two different roles? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=977.1600000000001s)]
*  My weapons also is with me. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=981.88s)]
*  Now it's always with me, my automatic rifle, that I cannot be without it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=985.08s)]
*  And yes, it's a completely different life. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=991.0s)]
*  But the war, something happened that changed the whole of our life. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=994.12s)]
*  And now we have the existential choice to be or not to be. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=998.12s)]
*  That is the question. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1003.0s)]
*  No other. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1004.12s)]
*  So I'm sure that we need to stay shoulder to shoulder with our people. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1005.16s)]
*  And it is important for people to see that also members of the parliament, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1009.32s)]
*  like in the United States, its congressmen, are staying together with them shoulder to [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1014.44s)]
*  shoulder, encouraging them by their example. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1019.08s)]
*  I think this is important. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1022.12s)]
*  So that's why me and I know, yes, a number of my colleagues are doing absolutely the same. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1024.3600000000001s)]
*  And I appreciate it very much. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1030.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm in Budapest, Hungary today, the capital, but I've spent the past 10 days on Hungary's [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1034.3600000000001s)]
*  border with Ukraine. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1038.76s)]
*  Yesterday, I sat down with a woman who had just escaped Russia's assault on her country. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1040.28s)]
*  She had taken her four-year-old son, the few items that she could carry, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1045.48s)]
*  and run away from her home northwest of Kiev. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1048.92s)]
*  Here's what she told me about her journey and what and who she left behind. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1051.72s)]
*  Thank you for talking to us. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1057.72s)]
*  You've just come here across the border. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1059.0s)]
*  Where did you come from? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1061.24s)]
*  And you have this beautiful boy with you. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1079.48s)]
*  Tell me about him and how old he is. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1083.72s)]
*  He's probably the bravest of our family. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1108.92s)]
*  He's a spark that has always aroused our mood. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sELZVetETDE&t=1112.92s)]
