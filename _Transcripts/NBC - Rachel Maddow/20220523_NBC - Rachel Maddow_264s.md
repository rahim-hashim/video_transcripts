Video Description: Kate Kelly, correspondent for the New York Times, talks with Rachel Maddow about how Donald Trump son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner and Trump Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin used their political positions to make huge financial deals for themselves, and why such flagrant corruption is probably not prosecutable as a crime.

# Kushner, Mnuchin Self-Dealing Shows Need For Better Anti-Corruption Laws After Trump
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 23, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY)
*  Joining us now is one of the reporters who broke this story, New York Times correspondent Kate Kelly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=0.0s)]
*  Ms. Kelly, thank you very much for being here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel. Pleasure to join you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=5.76s)]
*  What is the connection between the meetings that Mr. Kushner and Mr. Mnuchin took as government officials [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=8.76s)]
*  and the later investment that was made by government officials in these foreign countries you've described [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=14.76s)]
*  to make these massive investments in private ventures for both of those men? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=20.76s)]
*  Well, at a minimum, Rachel, I think those business meetings built the relationships and kept them warm [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=25.520000000000003s)]
*  at a time when both Kushner and Mnuchin were a mere weeks away or just a couple of months away from leaving [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  office as Trump stepped down. So they got to know their foreign counterparts in Kushner's case. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=37.52s)]
*  These were rulers of countries. These were other senior officials, but also importantly, the heads of sovereign [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=44.52s)]
*  wealth funds or the large government investment funds run by many countries and notably in the Persian Gulf. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=51.28s)]
*  In Mnuchin's case, and you pointed this out in your intro, these 18 country visits over four years, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=57.28s)]
*  which had a huge cluster toward the end of the administration actually in January of 21, helped him get [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=63.28s)]
*  acquainted with these major, major investors who just near months later would invest in his funds. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=69.28s)]
*  Now, we also know that this Abraham Fund you mentioned, this $3 billion, or at least that was the goal, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=76.04s)]
*  U.S. government-backed fund that was meant to fund development projects in places like Palestine, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=82.04s)]
*  where Israeli checkpoints would be improved and modernized, among other things. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=88.04s)]
*  That was something that was on both of those officials' item agenda as they toured the Gulf in those final [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=94.04s)]
*  years to talk about building enthusiasm and support for the fund. But as you noted, it didn't really go anywhere. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  What did go somewhere right after government was Jared Kushner's private equity fund, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  Affinity Partners, and Steven Mnuchin's private equity fund, Liberty Strategic Capital. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  I described this as self-dealing because as somebody who's not an expert in this, somebody just a lay observer, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  I think it's a very good dictionary definition of somebody using their public position, their access to government resources, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=125.56s)]
*  potentially even their actions as government officials, to set themselves up for private gain. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=131.56s)]
*  Is that fair in terms of the layman's understanding of that? And as an extension of that, is this potentially illegal behavior? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=137.56s)]
*  Well, that was obviously one of the top questions we were asking ourselves, Rachel, as David Kirkpatrick and I reported on this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=147.56s)]
*  I think one of the things that I'm talking to ethics experts is this is quite legal. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=154.32s)]
*  If we as Americans want to see this kind of activity ceased in the future, we need to probably codify some new rules and regulations [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=158.32s)]
*  that prevent one from seeking outside investments from former government counterparts once they leave office, in this case, the executive branch. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=168.32s)]
*  But right now, this is quite legal. Self-dealing is a little bit more of a term of art, but sure, depending on your perspective, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=176.32s)]
*  that is something you could say. There are laws that govern your participation as a government official in matters that substantially or personally affect your financial position [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=184.32s)]
*  or that of your immediate family. I'm sure you're familiar with those. I believe it's 18 USC 208. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=196.32s)]
*  But in this case, while not impossible, while it did speak to some ethics experts and some lawyers who thought this could theoretically be applied here, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=202.32s)]
*  it was very hard because what you really need to establish is a quid pro quo. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  So both parties, in this case, a sovereign wealth fund and these officials would have to know there was sort of a two part transaction going on that resulted in them receiving this money. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think I don't know that that's the case. I wouldn't want to suggest that it was. But in any case, even if it were very hard to demonstrate for a prosecutor. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  I think it's important to prove it in court, of course. Kate Kelly, New York Times correspondent with this groundbreaking reporting. Thank you for helping us understand it. I appreciate your time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=234.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GmBz2SlrzY&t=243.84s)]
