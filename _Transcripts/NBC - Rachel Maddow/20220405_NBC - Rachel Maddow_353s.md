# Panic Escalates As Russia Increases Attacks On Civilian Targets In Southern Ukraine
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4)
*  Joining us now is Isabelle Kershudian, a Washington Post foreign correspondent who's been reporting from Ukraine for the past two and a half months. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=0.0s)]
*  Isabelle, it's good to see you again. Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=7.0s)]
*  We just quoted from your reporting on the bombing of that hospital in Mikhailayev. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=10.0s)]
*  I needed to tell us more about this. Tell us about the patients and the medical staff and how they're able to cope in this type of environment, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=15.0s)]
*  which is unfortunately, as you were reporting, becoming common across this country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=23.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think what really strikes me now when you go to the site of some of these bombings and attacks is just right away, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=28.0s)]
*  people have this kind of numbness as they just start to clean up the scene. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=37.0s)]
*  I mean, when we got there, people, volunteers and hospital staff were just sweeping up glass. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=42.0s)]
*  I mean, sweeping up areas that had been their offices, their wards, things of that sort. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=47.0s)]
*  I think they were, there's just kind of these attacks happen. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=54.0s)]
*  They expect them at this point and right away they start to clean up. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=59.0s)]
*  But I mean, that hospital got lucky that everyone was evacuated in time and no one was seriously injured. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=63.0s)]
*  But one woman, she had come to the hospital with a heart condition. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=70.0s)]
*  I even said to her, I can't imagine this was good for your heart, the stress of this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=74.0s)]
*  And she said, you know, I'm too scared to stay here at the hospital. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=80.0s)]
*  I'd rather go home. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=84.0s)]
*  And that's where, you know, that becomes really heartbreaking is that even a hospital becomes unsafe. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=85.0s)]
*  It's a place that Ukrainians now expect to be targeted. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=91.0s)]
*  And, you know, they're afraid to be there even if it's, you know, they need to be there for their health. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=94.0s)]
*  There's something in your reporting was very similar to what Richard Engel had from Buccia. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=101.0s)]
*  You reported on the experiences of Ukrainian residents living in the villages around Mikolayev where Russians were. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=106.0s)]
*  And they'd been asking them where the Nazis live. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=113.0s)]
*  And I don't know whether this is something they're really trying to get at or whether this is part of the propaganda that these these soldiers were given when they invaded Ukraine. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=117.0s)]
*  But they're going around looking for Nazis, they say. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=125.0s)]
*  Yeah, everyone we talked to said the Russians were asking where are the Nazis? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=129.0s)]
*  Where are the Banderites? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=135.0s)]
*  You know, which was a group that was a Ukrainian national group that was formed in World War Two. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=138.0s)]
*  They were looking for people dressed in black. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=143.0s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of residents that we talked to in these areas, you know, these are small towns and villages, you know, about an hour northeast of Mikolayev that were occupied for about two years. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=146.0s)]
*  And then about 10 days, you know, those people kind of looked at them at the Russian soldiers and said, we have no people like that here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=158.0s)]
*  We don't know what you're talking about. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=166.0s)]
*  And their impression was that, you know, those soldiers had been kind of, you know, almost brainwashed by this Kremlin false propaganda that's been used to justify, you know, this unprovoked war. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=169.0s)]
*  The Russian troops are trying to make their way west along southern Ukraine. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=183.0s)]
*  And Mikolayev has been a point at which they've been stopped. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=188.0s)]
*  They were planning to otherwise be in Odessa, the beautiful port city of Odessa, the biggest port in the country on the Black Sea. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=191.0s)]
*  You have spent a lot of time reporting on Odessa, and it's where your parents were born. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=199.0s)]
*  Tell us what it's like, what it was like to be there and how that port city is doing right now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=204.0s)]
*  Everybody there is expecting that the worst is still yet to come. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=209.0s)]
*  Yeah, Odessa is, you know, for the most part, life there has returned to normal for, you know, normal-ish, I guess, as normal as things can get in a war. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=216.0s)]
*  There are, you know, still military checkpoints and a heavy military presence. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=225.0s)]
*  But even the zoo is open nowadays. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=231.0s)]
*  You know, salons are open, restaurants are open. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=233.0s)]
*  But at the same time, people know that that's the prize for Russia, right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=237.0s)]
*  And there were, you know, airstrikes recently on the fuel depots there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=241.0s)]
*  I think people are nervous. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=246.0s)]
*  I think they're kind of scared as this war appears to be shifting east and south. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=248.0s)]
*  And now we're seeing Mikolayev come under much heavier attacks. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=253.0s)]
*  I think there's kind of a push that people in Mikolayev are starting to feel where we're seeing more cluster munitions, more attacks in broad daylights that seem to be kind of purposely targeting civilians. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=259.0s)]
*  And so those people end up evacuating to Odessa. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=273.0s)]
*  And, you know, as you mentioned, I have family there. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=276.0s)]
*  My family is from there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=280.0s)]
*  My great aunt is there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=281.0s)]
*  And I remember the morning of those airstrikes on the fuel depots, my great aunt was like, maybe you should leave. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=282.0s)]
*  And, you know, obviously that's not really how my job works. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=289.0s)]
*  My job is to stay and, you know, document what happens. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=293.0s)]
*  But it's a weird feeling there because on the surface it looks very normal, but people are getting nervous as kind of it seems that that area is going to come into play soon. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=296.0s)]
*  It is it's not just very hard. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=310.0s)]
*  It's impossible to put your feelings aside as a journalist when you're covering a story like this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=313.0s)]
*  But when you have your heart in it because your family is actually there, that is a hell of a challenge. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=317.0s)]
*  And we thank you for for living up to it and doing it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=322.0s)]
*  Isabel Kershudian is a Washington Post foreign correspondent. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=325.0s)]
*  And we thank you for your time tonight. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=328.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI_cbJTsCe4&t=340.0s)]
