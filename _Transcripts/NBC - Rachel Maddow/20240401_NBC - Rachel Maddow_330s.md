# Judge has enough of Trump's attacks on family members; extends gag order on 'defendant's vitriol'
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps)
*  Right off the top, there has been some breaking news just in the last hour or so, in a couple [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=0.0s)]
*  of the legal cases involving former President Donald Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=4.64s)]
*  One of these we've been watching now for a few weeks. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=8.68s)]
*  He lost a big fraud case against his company a few weeks ago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=10.64s)]
*  There were huge financial penalties that he's been ordered to pay in that case. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=14.16s)]
*  He is going to appeal the judgment. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=18.36s)]
*  He's going to appeal the ruling in that case. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=20.84s)]
*  But he, in the meantime, has to put up a bond while he files that appeal. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=23.32s)]
*  We've been watching this because the amount of the judgment against him was so huge, the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=27.96s)]
*  bond he has to put up is huge, roughly a half billion dollars. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  So his lawyers told the court as the deadline for filing that bond, for posting that bond [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=37.28s)]
*  approached, his lawyers told the court that they'd been unable to obtain the bond. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=42.36s)]
*  They said they had reached out to 30 different insurance companies, but nobody would help [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=47.64s)]
*  him post a bond of that size. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=53.36s)]
*  At that point, it looked like New York's attorney general, who brought this fraud case in the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=55.76s)]
*  first place, the AG might be about to start seizing Trump's bank accounts and seizing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=59.96s)]
*  his properties to secure the judgment. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=65.6s)]
*  But then, you may recall, there was sort of a last-minute reprieve for Trump. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=70.48s)]
*  A New York appeals court lowered the bond to less than half of what had originally been [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=74.52s)]
*  ordered. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=79.12s)]
*  They did not explain why they were doing that, but that's what they did. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=80.12s)]
*  They brought the bond amount down from nearly $500 million to $175 million. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=83.84s)]
*  That would be all that Trump would have to put up while he appeals this fraud judgment [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=91.48s)]
*  against him. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=95.44s)]
*  They also, in addition to reducing the amount that he had to put up, they gave him more [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=96.44s)]
*  time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=100.92s)]
*  The deadline was extended, so he would have to later this week to put up that new $175 [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=101.92s)]
*  million bond. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, as of this last hour, we just got confirmation in court documents that Trump has put up a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  post-it that reduced amount of bond. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=113.84s)]
*  He secured a $175 million bond through something called Knight Specialty Insurance Company [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=115.92s)]
*  in Los Angeles, Knight, K-N-I-G-H-T, Knight Specialty Insurance. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=123.44s)]
*  That company is part of an insurance group that is chaired by a major Republican donor. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  Make of that what you will. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=135.88s)]
*  But that move tonight would appear to mean that the former president has satisfied his [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=138.12s)]
*  financial obligations in that huge fraud case for now, at least until his appeal is [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=143.24s)]
*  heard, and that is not expected to be at least until this fall. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=148.84s)]
*  So that's one of the two big developments that's just happened this evening. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=152.52s)]
*  There's another. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  In Trump's other New York State case, which is a criminal case, not a civil case, this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=157.88s)]
*  is the hush money case that is due to start two weeks from today, the judge in that case [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=162.56s)]
*  has tonight just issued an expanded gag order on Mr. Trump. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=168.64s)]
*  Last week, this judge issued an order that banned Trump from attacking witnesses or prosecutors [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=173.32s)]
*  or jurors or court staff, as well as their relatives. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=179.88s)]
*  After that gag order, Trump started publicly attacking not only the judge, who actually is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=184.64s)]
*  and remains sort of fair game for criticism under the gag order, but he also repeatedly [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=192.84s)]
*  went after the judge's daughter, including identifying her by name on social media. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=198.28s)]
*  Now, the New York District Attorney, the prosecutor, has brought this case, asked the judge to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=203.48s)]
*  expand the gag order to include family members of the judge and family members of the DA, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=208.08s)]
*  of the prosecutor. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=214.88s)]
*  Tonight, the judge has done just that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=215.88s)]
*  So, again, the gag order still doesn't apply to the judge himself or the prosecutor himself, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=218.76s)]
*  but it does now include their families. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=222.48s)]
*  And in expanding the gag order in that way, the judge did not mince words. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=226.12s)]
*  He said tonight, quote, This pattern of attacking family members of presiding jurists and attorneys [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=229.96s)]
*  assigned to his cases serves no legitimate purpose. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=235.12s)]
*  It merely injects fear in those assigned or called to participate in the proceedings that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  not only they but their family members as well are, quote, fair game for defendants. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=244.8s)]
*  Vitriol, the average observer, must now, after hearing defendants recent attacks, draw the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=249.56s)]
*  conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, they [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=255.24s)]
*  should worry not only for themselves but for their loved ones as well. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=259.64s)]
*  Such concerns will undoubtedly interfere with the fair administration of justice. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=263.92s)]
*  It constitutes direct attack on the rule of law itself. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=268.64s)]
*  Again, that that case, that criminal case, the first ever criminal case brought against [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=273.44s)]
*  a former president of the United States, it is slated to get underway in a New York courtroom [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=278.68s)]
*  two weeks from today. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  That's when Jerry's selection will start. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=284.98s)]
*  The judge tonight making clear that attacks on his family members or family members of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  the prosecutor will henceforth not be tolerated and will be subject to punishment by the court [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=291.5s)]
*  if they continue. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiW-tblvlps&t=298.18s)]
