# Watch Rachel Maddow Highlights: Feb. 6
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4)
*  I have an update for you on a story we covered a couple of weeks ago about an actual member of Congress who is definitely also an international man of mystery. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=0.0s)]
*  His name is Republican Congressman George Santos and his every utterance about his resume and record is now being scrutinized because almost everything he's ever said about himself is turning out to be a big torquey pie, which is rhyming slang for the man he lies. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=8.0s)]
*  So you might remember last month, a couple of weeks ago, we got this video of an interview Congressman Santos did with a Brazilian podcast called Radio Novello Apresenta. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=25.0s)]
*  And in this podcast interview, the Congressman said that he had been mugged in the middle of Fifth Avenue in New York City in broad daylight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=35.0s)]
*  And he said the mugger ran off, among other things, with his shoes, leaving him standing there in the middle of Fifth Avenue in his socks. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=43.0s)]
*  He also said somebody had then tried to kill him. Because of that, he said an NYPD police escort had to stand guard at his home because he had been the victim of an attempted murder. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=52.0s)]
*  And you know, who am I to say? Maybe. But think about it. If you were mugged in the middle of Fifth Avenue, if somebody tried to kill you, you would probably call the police, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=62.0s)]
*  I mean, you must have called the police if the result was that a police officer got stationed outside your home. That doesn't just happen. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=73.0s)]
*  After we found that interview and those statements by Congressman Santos, we checked to see if he had ever filed a police report about his alleged dramatic Fifth Avenue mugging or about being the victim of an attempted murder. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=80.0s)]
*  Well, now I can tell you here is what we have found out. This information was obtained by our colleagues at WNBC. It's being reported here exclusively. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=92.0s)]
*  According to law enforcement sources, there is no known record filed with the New York City Police Department in the last three years showing that George Santos claimed to be the victim of a robbery on Fifth Avenue. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=101.0s)]
*  Same goes for Anthony Devolder, which is another name George Santos has used in the past. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=114.0s)]
*  No police report on file for either of those names reporting a robbery of shoes or anything else in New York City. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=120.0s)]
*  Nor is there any record of George Santos alerting the NYPD to an attempted murder against him. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=127.0s)]
*  According to the same law enforcement sources, there is just one police report on record that mentions George Santos. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=134.0s)]
*  It concerns an incident in 2021 where Mr. Santos' neighbor allegedly threw some garbage at him. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=141.0s)]
*  And while nobody likes to have garbage thrown at them, in this case, I'm happy to say Mr. Santos reported that his neighbor missed. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=147.0s)]
*  So one failed attempt by his neighbor to throw garbage at him once. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=153.0s)]
*  Yes, there was a police report about that. Nothing about an attempted murder, nothing about a mugging specific to his shoes or not. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=158.0s)]
*  Our law enforcement sources checked their full log of police reports and complaints between January 2019 up to the end of last month. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=166.0s)]
*  They tell us to the best of their knowledge, aside from that one complaint about the neighbor lobbing trash in his general direction, but not right at him. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=173.0s)]
*  George Santos, apart from that, George Santos apart from that, had not filed a single police report or complaint to the NYPD in any of the last three years. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=181.0s)]
*  Now we reached out to Congressman Santos's office to ask him about all of this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=189.0s)]
*  His office told us that this isn't a congressional issue, and so we should therefore ask his lawyer. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=193.0s)]
*  We did. His lawyer told us no comment. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=199.0s)]
*  And look, who knows, maybe Republican Congressman George Santos decided to deal with that mugging in Manhattan on his own. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=205.0s)]
*  Maybe he summoned that police escort with his mind. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=213.0s)]
*  But we checked it out and doesn't seem to have gone down the way you might have expected. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=218.0s)]
*  In 2017, May 2017, an 18 year old neo-Nazi in Tampa, Florida, shot and killed two of his three roommates. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=225.0s)]
*  When the police searched the apartment after that double homicide, they ended up also arresting, in addition to the shooter, they ended up arresting a third roommate, one who was not shot. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=234.0s)]
*  Turns out that third roommate had been stockpiling a huge amount of homemade explosives in their shared garage. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=245.0s)]
*  In a separate incident a little more than a year earlier, March 2016, a 28 year old woman was arrested for robbing four different convenience stores in Maryland while armed with a machete. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=253.0s)]
*  Now get this, it all comes together. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=266.0s)]
*  Turns out the machete wielder and the explosives hoarder then began a relationship while they were each serving time in separate prisons. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=268.0s)]
*  Now today those two individuals were arrested again. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=277.0s)]
*  Federal prosecutors allege that the two plotted to attack five electrical power substations around Baltimore, Maryland. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=281.0s)]
*  Their plan was allegedly to knock out a ring of five specific electrical substations all in one day because they thought that would cause a cascading effect to, quote, completely destroy the whole city. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=288.0s)]
*  Meaning presumably they expected to knock Baltimore into a pre-electric light state of being and one that couldn't easily be repaired. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=300.0s)]
*  Now if that whole plan, if that whole idea to shoot up electrical substations, to knock out the power semi-permanently and cause major chaos, if that plan is giving you déjà vu, you are not mistaken. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=308.0s)]
*  There have been at least nine attacks on electric power substations, at least nine attacks across three different states, just in the past three months. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=320.0s)]
*  Early last year Homeland Security issued a bulletin warning that domestic violent extremists have, quote, developed credible specific plans to attack electricity infrastructure since at least 2020. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=330.0s)]
*  Now in most of these attacks, suspects haven't been identified and that means motives can't be identified either. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=345.0s)]
*  But last month NPR affiliates in Oregon and Washington obtained an FBI memo showing that neo-Nazi groups were calling for attacks just like this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=351.0s)]
*  The neo-Nazis that the FBI was tracking, quote, believe that an attack on electrical infrastructure will contribute to their ideological goal of causing societal collapse and a subsequent race war in the United States. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=361.0s)]
*  And that's part of what makes these arrests about this planned Baltimore attack today significant. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=373.0s)]
*  Because the former explosives hoarder arrested today, he's the founder of a neo-Nazi group called the Atomwaffen. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=380.0s)]
*  And the former machete-wielding robber, who was also arrested today, she wrote what the FBI believed to be an ideological manifesto of sorts, which both references hitting electrical substations to knock out power and also her admiration for the Unabomber and for Hitler. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=388.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Kathleen Ballou. She teaches history at Northwestern University. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=406.0s)]
*  She's the author of Bring the War Home, the White Power Movement and Paramilitary America, which is really the seminal text in this field. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=411.0s)]
*  Professor Ballou, I really appreciate you being here. Thanks for being here. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=419.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=423.0s)]
*  So I said at the top of the show tonight that this appears to be emerging as a favored tactic of the white power movement and the sort of neo-Nazi affiliated white supremacist movement in the United States. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=425.0s)]
*  Is that a fair generalization? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=436.0s)]
*  Yes, although the electrical part may be new, but infrastructure attacks by this movement are not new. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=439.0s)]
*  This is a strategy that was pioneered by a group called the Order in 1983, moving forward. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=446.0s)]
*  And that group is sort of the base of oper- well, the tactical base for Atomwaffen Division, which translates to the base. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=452.0s)]
*  So infrastructure attacks are one kind of violence among several others that are all laid out in a strategy in common in order to bring about what the movement seeks, which is the overthrow of the United States, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=462.0s)]
*  creation of a white ethno-state, mass violence against communities of color, and even genocide against non-white peoples. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=476.0s)]
*  So infrastructure attacks sit next to a show of force violence like the January 6th attack on the Capitol and mass casualty violence like the Oklahoma City bombing. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=485.0s)]
*  All of these exist together within one broad ideology in the white power movement. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=496.0s)]
*  I've heard this described as accelerationist tactics, and I know that's an awkward word. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=502.0s)]
*  But I wonder if you can sort of explain the thinking there, because I feel like there's a little bit of a leap of logic to it, which makes it not translate to non-expert sort of just news consumers about this. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=509.0s)]
*  I mean, the idea is that you'd attack infrastructure, you'd cause people material pain, you'd cause chaos and upset, and then somehow there's a slippery slope that results in race war and white people taking over and genocide against non-white people. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=520.0s)]
*  Like, why do they believe that infrastructure attacks and resulting chaos ultimately accelerate us to some race war future where they think they're going to win? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=534.0s)]
*  So infrastructure attacks and mass casualty violence and show of power attacks are all meant to do the same thing in the ideology of this movement, which is laid out in books like the Turner Diaries and in movement ideological writings of other kinds. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=544.0s)]
*  They are all supposed to awaken other people to what these activists see as the staggering state of emergency problems that face white people. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=561.0s)]
*  The woman arrested today in that piece of writing apparently said or said to an informant that she would do anything for my people. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=571.0s)]
*  This is the idea of white people as her race and as her nation. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=581.0s)]
*  It reflects a sense that white people are being extinguished and will be apocalyptically vanished if action is not taken. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=585.0s)]
*  So infrastructure attacks like taking out the power supply in Baltimore, taking out heat, taking out the ability of hospitals to perform their operations, right? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=594.0s)]
*  If you don't have hospital electricity, you can't run the basics of any of our systems. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=603.0s)]
*  These are meant to make other white people awaken to these injustices as perceived by these activists so that everyone will rise up a little bit, but at a time against the broader what they would call the system, which is the United States government. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=609.0s)]
*  Absolute insanity and holding force on a significant sliver of the white power movement you're describing, as he said, for at least the last 40 years. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=625.0s)]
*  Kathleen Ballew, associate professor of history at Northwestern, author of the seminal text Bring the War Home, the White Power Movement in Paramilitary America. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=636.0s)]
*  Professor Ballew, thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=645.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=648.0s)]
*  I mentioned in the introduction that there were at least nine different sort of criminal areas of inquiry, areas of inquiry about potential criminality that the DA's office was looking into at the time that you joined. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=650.0s)]
*  You say one of them was the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=664.0s)]
*  Another one was taxes, potential improper business expense deductions, deductions of consulting fees. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=667.0s)]
*  In his relationship with Deutsche Bank, could he have defrauded Deutsche Bank by getting financing through overstated financial statements? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=673.0s)]
*  Whether he'd engaged in money laundering through Deutsche Bank using overseas bank accounts? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=680.0s)]
*  The accuracy of materials he provided the GSA about the old post office and a host of other things, including insurance fraud, the restructuring of his loan on his Chicago skyscraper. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=685.0s)]
*  You go on and on and on. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=697.0s)]
*  When you describe that litany of areas of potential criminal inquiry for Trump and when you describe your reasoning and the debates between you and your team about the hush money thing, are you giving a potential lifeline to the H. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=699.0s)]
*  Trump's defense lawyers that if they do end up getting charged with anything related to any of those items, including the hush money matter, that your book could be used as evidence essentially to try to question the charges in court to say, look, prosecutors have been looking at this stuff for a long time. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=714.0s)]
*  Responsible prosecutors looked at this, decided there was nothing there and didn't charge it in the past. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=730.0s)]
*  This is selective prosecution or this is an overreach. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=734.0s)]
*  Have you given have you given the defense a leg up here? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=737.0s)]
*  Look, I don't think we've given the defense any kind of leg up. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=741.0s)]
*  When you look at the public reporting about the grand jury presentation that may now be underway, obviously I don't know what's going on behind closed doors in the DA's office and I don't know what evidence is being presented. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=744.0s)]
*  I don't know whether charges will be brought. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=759.0s)]
*  But as it relates to the hush money circumstances, those facts have been known literally for years. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=761.0s)]
*  Michael Cohen wrote about them in his book. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=769.0s)]
*  He testified about them. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=772.0s)]
*  Stormy Daniels wrote a book. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=774.0s)]
*  Stormy Daniels appeared on Michael Cohen's podcast to talk about it. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=776.0s)]
*  And the federal prosecutors brought their own prosecution based on those facts. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=780.0s)]
*  So I'm not letting any cats out of the bag, if you will. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=785.0s)]
*  Those cats have been running all over the place literally for years. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=789.0s)]
*  But the reasoning about whether or not to bring charges based on those facts, is that potentially helpful to any defense counsel? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=794.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=799.0s)]
*  The legal issue that I've noted in the book is an issue that appears on the face of the statute. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=801.0s)]
*  It's already been written about, was written about before my book has come out. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=807.0s)]
*  On the financial statement side of the coin, we don't know, I certainly don't know what investigation is taking place, if any. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=812.0s)]
*  I don't know whether charges will ultimately be brought. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=823.0s)]
*  What I do know is that the evidence underlying the charges we intended to bring is all out there in the public record. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=826.0s)]
*  In the civil case that the Attorney General of the State of New York, Letitia James, brought, she filed a civil complaint of well over 200 pages, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=834.0s)]
*  which lays out in abundant detail the assets that were misvalued, the basis for the overvaluation of the assets. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=844.0s)]
*  That is how she concluded and why she concluded that the assets were overvalued. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=854.0s)]
*  And the evidence that we were looking at in connection with a potential criminal case has been laid out in chapter and verse in that complaint. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=858.0s)]
*  And again, there is nothing in my book about the financial statement investigation, the criminal investigation that we were doing. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=869.0s)]
*  There are no new facts that don't appear in the Attorney General's complaint. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=879.0s)]
*  So I was pretty well satisfied when I wrote the book that I wasn't going to interfere with any potential prosecution. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=883.0s)]
*  And look, I wrote the book in part to say there should have been a criminal prosecution. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=892.0s)]
*  There needs to be a criminal prosecution. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=899.0s)]
*  The last thing I would have done is to do something that would get in the way of a criminal prosecution that I thought and still think should be brought. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=901.0s)]
*  Mr. Pomerantz, you describe that consideration of using state RICO charges essentially against Trump. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=910.0s)]
*  But then you say, quote, the task of building out the proof on the whole pattern of enterprise corruption was simply too ambitious for the human and investigative bandwidth we had. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=916.0s)]
*  In other words, you think you had the substance of a case there, but it was basically too hard to do given the research resources of the DA's office. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=927.0s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=936.0s)]
*  It is fair. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=937.0s)]
*  And one of the things that people need to remember is that the district attorney for New York County is a local prosecutor's office. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=938.0s)]
*  This is not the kind of special counsel operation housed in the Department of Justice, which hires and has a staff of dozens of lawyers and investigators working on a single mission. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=946.0s)]
*  We had a small staff of lawyers, many of them with other responsibilities. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=962.0s)]
*  We had to work within the jurisdictional and procedural limitations imposed by New York law, which are substantial. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=967.0s)]
*  As a for instance, if we want to speak, as we did to a witness who lives in Ohio in a federal case, FBI agents go service subpoena and there's nationwide service of process. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=974.0s)]
*  If we want to speak to a witness who lives in Ohio, we have to go through an elaborate legal procedure involving the Ohio authorities to see if that person can be compelled to speak to us. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=986.0s)]
*  So for a whole variety of reasons having to do with the substantive law of New York, the procedural law of New York, the resources that we had, it became clear over time that an enterprise corruption case was simply biting off more than we could chew. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=997.0s)]
*  There came a point when both Kerry Dunn and I spoke with Cy Vance, the district attorney, about enlarging the team and adding resources to it and giving us more bandwidth. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1014.0s)]
*  But again, we were coming up on the end of Cy Vance's term. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1026.0s)]
*  We wanted to hire some senior people with extensive prosecutive experience. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1030.0s)]
*  We didn't think it was fair to the incoming district attorney to start hiring senior people at the very end of Cy Vance's term. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1035.0s)]
*  And in any event, we ultimately decided that largely for practical reasons, an enterprise corruption case was simply more than we could accomplish within a reasonable time, bearing in mind that we were trying to work quickly. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1044.0s)]
*  And bringing a racketeering case, particularly one that incorporates other stuff, Trump Foundation, Trump University, the hush money, the financial statements. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1062.0s)]
*  It's such a big ball of wax that ultimately we decided, you know what, let's focus on a smaller, more contained set of charges. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1076.0s)]
*  And that's when we started to focus on the financial statements. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1085.0s)]
*  Now, one thing that happened when Tish James revealed the factual basis for that civil suit is that she referred it to SDNY. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1089.0s)]
*  She referred it back to federal prosecutors at SDNY, suggesting that there's federal prosecution to be done there along, given that fact pattern. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1097.0s)]
*  We have seen through public reporting and public revelations how much pressure main justice put on SDNY to let Trump off the hook, particularly on the hush money issue. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1105.0s)]
*  While Trump was president, now he's no longer president. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1114.0s)]
*  Do you believe that SDNY will ever do anything with this? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1118.0s)]
*  I haven't seen any reporting to indicate that there's an active investigation. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1121.0s)]
*  As I mentioned in the book, this was a case that cried out for federal investigation for all the reasons I talk about there and have alluded to here. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1126.0s)]
*  I don't know why there was never an intensive federal investigation of Donald Trump's finances. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1137.0s)]
*  When the New York Times did their big expose in October of 2020 of Trump's tax returns, I recall reading that and thinking to myself, well, this is going to start the feds on a substantial investigation. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1145.0s)]
*  Maybe it did, and we never found out about it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1160.0s)]
*  But as I say, there's nothing to indicate that that investigation happened. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1164.0s)]
*  And one of the enduring mysteries, which I can't answer, is why it didn't happen. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1169.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xOZpduEIr4&t=1199.0s)]
