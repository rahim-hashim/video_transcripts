# Carroll moves to teach Trump lesson he failed to learn from loss in court
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [May 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec)
*  E. Jean Carroll and Robbie Kaplan were here live on the show last week in the immediate [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=0.0s)]
*  wake of that remarkable court ruling, in which a jury held unanimously that former President [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=5.72s)]
*  Donald Trump had sexually abused E. Jean Carroll and that when he denied that and disparaged [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=13.1s)]
*  her and called her a liar, he was the one who was lying. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=20.6s)]
*  And he was defaming Ms. Carroll, and he was going to have to pay for it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=25.12s)]
*  In that case, that jury ordered Donald Trump to pay E. Jean Carroll $5 million in damages, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=29.52s)]
*  both for what he did and for what he said about it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=37.4s)]
*  But if you watched the show last week and you saw that interview that I did with E. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=41.72s)]
*  Jean Carroll and with her attorney, you might remember that, you know, in addition to sort [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=45.32s)]
*  of reflecting on the fact that they had won that case, one of the things they were newly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=51.3s)]
*  in the wake of that jury verdict was that even though Trump had just been ordered to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=56.92s)]
*  pay out millions of dollars because of his attacks on E. Jean Carroll because of his [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=63.52s)]
*  lies about her, even though he had just been ordered to pay millions of dollars, literally [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=68.12s)]
*  within a day of that jury verdict and being ordered to pay all that money, he was out [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=74.72s)]
*  there saying all the same things again. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=80.0s)]
*  You did force accountability, and then he did it again. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=85.64s)]
*  The defamation, the calling you a liar, the exact same things the jury held him liable [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=89.0s)]
*  for the day before. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=93.64s)]
*  He did again the next day on national television. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=94.64s)]
*  Is that just the way it has to be? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=97.66s)]
*  Do you think that potentially could be actionable? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=99.02s)]
*  If you were to file another suit, would it work the same way? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=101.92s)]
*  So it's definitely actionable. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=104.66s)]
*  He's not going to get away with it another time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  It's unprecedented for a person to have been held liable in defamation to keep doing the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=110.72s)]
*  defamation. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=116.48s)]
*  So there are not a lot of cases that we can look to for a playbook about how to do it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=117.96s)]
*  But suffice to say, I have a lot of lawyers who are very busy looking into this, and we [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=122.08s)]
*  are weighing all of our options. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=126.4s)]
*  Now tonight, here we go. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=128.28s)]
*  The New York Times was first to report E. Jean Carroll seeks new damages from Trump for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=130.64s)]
*  comments on CNN for comments that he made a new about E. Jean Carroll on CNN the night [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=136.72s)]
*  after the jury verdict in her case against him. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=143.16s)]
*  Now, this is not a new lawsuit against Trump filed by E. Jean Carroll. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=146.52s)]
*  It's effectively an addendum to the existing litigation they've already been in with Trump. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=151.28s)]
*  This new filing today is with the same judge who presided in the trial in which E. Jean [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=156.72s)]
*  Carroll was just awarded five million dollars in damages from Trump. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=162.52s)]
*  This newly amended complaint filed tonight by lawyer Roberta Kaplan and her firm, it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=166.56s)]
*  documents all the new statements that Trump made attacking E. Jean Carroll online and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=173.24s)]
*  on CNN's bizarre town hall event with him the night after the initial jury verdict. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=178.68s)]
*  It then runs through some of the threats that E. Jean Carroll received from Trump supporters [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=184.12s)]
*  after Trump went on the attack against her again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=189.48s)]
*  And the complaint then says this, and I'm not a lawyer. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=192.68s)]
*  I'm just I have only a layman's understanding of these things. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=196.44s)]
*  But I feel like this complaint is written in such a way that I sort of get how it is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=199.08s)]
*  that they are attaching this new complaint to the existing litigation they're already [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=203.4s)]
*  in with him. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=208.12s)]
*  It says, quote, At the jury trial that took place in the related action between April [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=209.12s)]
*  May 9th, this court instructed the jury concerning an award of punitive damages in connection [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  with Trump's previous defamatory statement in twenty twenty two. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=221.32s)]
*  This court instructed the jury as follows, quote, punitive damages may be awarded to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  punish a defendant who's acted maliciously and to discourage others from doing the same. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=231.92s)]
*  A statement is made with malice or it is made maliciously if it is made with deliberate [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=236.6s)]
*  intent to injure or made out of hatred or ill will or spite or made with willful or [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=241.2s)]
*  wanton or reckless disregard of another's rights. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=246.88s)]
*  Both prior and subsequent defamations and subsequent statements of the defendant may [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=250.16s)]
*  reflect a defendant's malice. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=255.6s)]
*  Trump's defamatory statements post verdict show the depth of his malice toward Carroll. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=258.4s)]
*  So that's how the lawyers phrase it in this complaint. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=264.56s)]
*  But it sort of makes sense. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. In layman's words and other terms. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  The jury was told that they're supposed to consider the effect of sort of sort of the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  amount of malice this person had when he made his statements defaming this other person. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=277.92s)]
*  And the jury was instructed that they can judge the amount of malice he had not just [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  by things he said and did before the statements in question, but by things he said and did after. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  So after the initial statements by him that were at issue in the previous trial, after [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=297.6s)]
*  he defamed E. Jean Carroll, which is what the jury found, you know, they held him liable [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=303.36s)]
*  for it in court. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=309.76s)]
*  After that, he, in fact, went back and made more and worse statements about her. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=310.56s)]
*  And the claim here is that that that matters. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=316.48s)]
*  At least E. Jean Carroll's attorneys are arguing that that should matter in terms of how much [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=318.8s)]
*  he should have to pay. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  Because that is something that speaks directly to the amount of malice and the type of malice [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  he had toward her when he made those statements that is relevant to a civil jury deciding [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=329.68s)]
*  what the consequences should be for him of him having made those statements. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=336.4s)]
*  So that's that's basically the argument. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=341.76s)]
*  What's she demanding here? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=343.28s)]
*  What is she asking for? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=344.24s)]
*  Well, here it is for the complaint. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=345.44s)]
*  Prayer for relief. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=347.84s)]
*  Wherefore E. Jean Carroll prays for relief as follows. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  A. Ordering Trump to retract any and all defamatory statements. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=353.44s)]
*  B. Ordering Trump to pay compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=357.84s)]
*  in no event less than ten million dollars. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=363.2s)]
*  C. Ordering Trump to pay punitive damages. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  In addition to compensatory damages, to pay punitive damages in an amount to be determined [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=372.0s)]
*  at trial. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  And she also wants him to have to pay all the costs, all the costs of the trial. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  All the court costs on both sides, which of course could be a lot. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=382.88s)]
*  It then closes with a jury demand. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=386.32s)]
*  The last part of her prayer for relief is that she wants all this handled back before [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=388.48s)]
*  a jury. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=393.52s)]
*  So that has happened just tonight. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=395.6s)]
*  The complaint spelling out in pretty plain English that according to E. Jean Carroll's [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=397.76s)]
*  lawyers, what they want the court to consider is that if Trump's going to keep lying about [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=403.76s)]
*  these sexual assault claims and he's going to keep lying about E. Jean Carroll, then the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=407.68s)]
*  five million dollars he's already been ordered to pay, that isn't going to be enough. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=411.92s)]
*  There's going to be more. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  This conduct supports a very substantial punitive damages award in Carroll's favor, both to [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=419.12s)]
*  punish Trump and to deter him from engaging in further defamation and to deter others [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=425.44s)]
*  from doing the same. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  So they want compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=432.72s)]
*  ten million dollars. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=437.76s)]
*  And in addition to that, they want very substantial punitive damages on top of the ten million [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=438.88s)]
*  plus costs. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=445.12s)]
*  And they want it back before the jury. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=446.64s)]
*  you [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGOJsVh0Ec&t=467.76s)]
