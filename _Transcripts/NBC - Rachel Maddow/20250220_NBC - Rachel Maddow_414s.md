# Trump apparently oblivious to political damage of his embrace of Russia
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [February 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s)
*  While all this is happening domestically, the Trump administration, of course, has also [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=0.0s)]
*  moved radically and quickly to move our country in international affairs to the other side [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=4.7s)]
*  of the board. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=12.16s)]
*  Since World War II, we—since the end of World War II, we have been allied with Europe, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  and essentially allied against Russia. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=20.6s)]
*  Now we are apparently allied with the dictatorship in Russia, and we're against Europe. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=23.44s)]
*  And today, as part of this 180-degree realignment of the United States from the proverbial allied [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  side of the democracies to the Axis side of the dictatorships, today, President Trump [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=36.08s)]
*  said that in the Russia-Ukraine war, not only are we switching sides, but we're switching [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  sides because it's Ukraine who's the dictatorship and it's Ukraine who started the war, which [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  is Orwellian backwards speak, right? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=53.12s)]
*  Ukraine got invaded. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  They didn't invade themselves. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  That's why, until now, we have been standing up for them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=58.68s)]
*  And it's one thing for me to tell you that here on MSNBC in the 9 p.m. Eastern Show, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  but what do Republican senators think about that, who have power to turn the country around? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=65.46s)]
*  At least more power than anybody else does. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=70.96s)]
*  Republican Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota asked about what Trump said today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=74.4s)]
*  He said, actually, quote, Zelensky was the duly elected president of Ukraine, saying, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=77.2s)]
*  quote, I think that has been, excuse me, I think he has been a key component in the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=82.24s)]
*  fact that they've been able to withstand the Russian attacks. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=86.24s)]
*  Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, quote, I would like to see that in context [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=90.52s)]
*  because I would certainly never refer to President Zelensky as a dictator. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=95.28s)]
*  Trust me, Senator, the context doesn't help. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=99.84s)]
*  Republican Senator Tom Tillis of North Carolina says, quote, dictator is not a word that I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=103.0s)]
*  would use to describe Zelensky. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  You could push back on that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=112.24s)]
*  If you disagree, it might matter, given that your job is Republican United States Senator. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=116.24s)]
*  You alone might actually have a limiting effect on what is happening to our country right [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=123.8s)]
*  now along these lines in which you plainly disagree with what the president is doing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=133.18s)]
*  Have you considered using your power? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=137.4s)]
*  Here was Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi about what he thinks of our apparently [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  our new closest ally, Vladimir Putin. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=147.62s)]
*  My position is that anything meaningful, any any sort of peace talks that might get a fair [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=152.06s)]
*  result would definitely need to have the Ukrainians at the table and make sure that European interests [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=160.66s)]
*  are considered and carefully weighed. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  Do you think that Putin can be trusted in these negotiations? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=176.26s)]
*  No. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=179.22s)]
*  Putin is a war criminal and should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=180.22s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has violated every tenet of international law and should be indicted [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=188.1s)]
*  and prosecuted and jailed, possibly executed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=196.54s)]
*  How big of a blunder was it to take off, for Hexeth to take out the NATO-Ukraine issue [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=199.84s)]
*  off the table? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=204.82s)]
*  Well, you know, I made a statement about that and let me just say Secretary Hexeth and I [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=205.82s)]
*  spoke while he was in Poland and I was in Munich. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=215.18s)]
*  And we, I think to the extent that his subsequent statement was somewhat of a walk back, that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=221.28s)]
*  was a favorable development. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=234.38s)]
*  And do you have any concerns after being there about the stability of the NATO alliance given [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=235.38s)]
*  what the U.S. is doing with Russia? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=240.36s)]
*  The NATO alliance is very important. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  We've been drawn into two bloody wars, massive, killing conflagrations in the last 100 years. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=248.96s)]
*  I think the best way for a European general war to be avoided that would eventually cause [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=263.04s)]
*  us to become involved is to ensure that the rule of law that's been observed for 70 years [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=273.88s)]
*  in Europe be enforced and protected. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=282.82s)]
*  That's why we have NATO. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=288.82s)]
*  That's why the European Union exists. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=290.38s)]
*  So thank you very much. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=293.1s)]
*  Do you think that Trump is undercutting NATO in any way? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=294.1s)]
*  And at that, he walks away at that point. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=298.26s)]
*  But you see that there's a foundation here for real leverage to stop what Trump is doing, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=302.66s)]
*  or at least to try to stop it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=308.44s)]
*  I mean, he talks there about what his conversation with Secretary Hexeth might have caused. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=309.72s)]
*  I think to the extent that his subsequent statement after we spoke was somewhat of a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=316.58000000000004s)]
*  walk back, that was a favorable development. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  Senator Wicker talked to Pete Hexeth. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  That made Pete Hexeth take back his assertion that Ukraine can never be part of NATO and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=326.6s)]
*  Russia gets to keep all of the parts of Ukraine that it's already claimed. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=331.38s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=337.54s)]
*  Because Senator Wicker is not a commentator, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=338.54s)]
*  Senator Wicker is the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Republican chairman [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=341.44s)]
*  of that committee. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=345.94s)]
*  He has power to wield here to stop the administration from doing what it's doing, which he plainly [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=347.2s)]
*  thinks is wrong. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't think Vladimir Putin should be getting a state visit in the United States [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=353.98s)]
*  of America. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=357.42s)]
*  He thinks if Vladimir Putin steps foot in the United States of America, he should be [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=358.42s)]
*  arrested, incarcerated for the rest of his life, or potentially executed. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's one thing to think that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=367.04s)]
*  It's another thing to say it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=370.8s)]
*  You could even say it on a podcast and it won't matter. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=372.02000000000004s)]
*  But if you say it and you're the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=374.04s)]
*  it matters. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=377.92s)]
*  And you can change the actions of this government. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=378.98s)]
*  at this point, have power to change what Trump is doing if they can find their spines. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=385.12s)]
*  And it may be the whole country's job to help them find it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nrlitt3f3s&t=390.74s)]
