# Trump team frantically claws back foolhardy funding cut orders as outrage grows
**NBC - Rachel Maddow:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I)
*  We are supposed to be intimidated by these guys, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=0.0s)]
*  Steve Bannon says they're going to rule for 50 years. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=4.16s)]
*  Enrique Tarrio, the Proud Boys guy who Trump just let out of prison, he says it's going [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=8.76s)]
*  to be 100 years, because they're so capable. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  We're supposed to be so intimidated and so impressed with them, while they are just [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=16.4s)]
*  shambolic at things they care about and things they don't. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=22.12s)]
*  They're shambolic when they're trying. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  They're shambolic in passing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  They have repeatedly just abjectly humiliated and embarrassed themselves every single day, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  including the president personally, and it hasn't even been two weeks yet. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=37.68s)]
*  And, you know, in these 10 days, less than two weeks, we're already seeing them—unsurprisingly, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=43.92s)]
*  We're seeing them fail and collapse and try to do backsees with all the things they [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=51.76s)]
*  have failed at trying to do. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=58.08s)]
*  It started the very first day. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=59.92s)]
*  You remember, day one, they announced a hiring freeze, full freeze, no exceptions, at the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=61.28s)]
*  VA, at Veterans Affairs. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=65.88s)]
*  So, doctors, nurses, counselors all hired to work at the VA. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=67.92s)]
*  People who want to work with our veterans in the VA health system, their job offers [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=71.8s)]
*  were withdrawn. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=75.84s)]
*  We don't want you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=77.4s)]
*  Day one, there was a hue and cry and a huge pushback. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=79.28s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=82.36s)]
*  And then, whoops, climb down. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=84.76s)]
*  Oops. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=86.56s)]
*  Actually, we didn't mean that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=87.56s)]
*  Never mind about the hiring freeze for VA health personnel, at least. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=88.56s)]
*  We take that back. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  That's not what we meant. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  That was day one. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  We covered that here on this show, day one, and I remember wondering whether that was [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  just going to be a one-off. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=99.36s)]
*  Nope, it's not. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=100.36s)]
*  It's at least one of these every day. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=102.36s)]
*  Same deal, for example, with PEPFAR, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=105.08s)]
*  With the HIV treatment program that is credited with saving 25 million lives. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=107.72s)]
*  They announced that PEPFAR was going away. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=113.36s)]
*  Stop work order for PEPFAR. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=115.88s)]
*  Effective immediately. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=117.24s)]
*  Anybody getting HIV treatment through this program, too bad that's getting cut off. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=118.36s)]
*  No warning instantly. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=123.64s)]
*  Even if there are HIV antiretroviral medicines that are on the shelf and already paid for, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  no, we are cutting off patients who are actively taking these drugs, which literally puts millions [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=129.24s)]
*  of people's lives at risk since the treatment is what keeps you alive. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=135.16s)]
*  It's also a brilliant way to mass manufacture new strains of drug-resistant HIV to share [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=139.72s)]
*  with the whole world, including the United States, since drug-resistant HIV is what you [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=146.2s)]
*  get when you start people on treatment and then take them off it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=150.76s)]
*  Then other people who get that strain of HIV can't take the drugs to keep them alive, and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=154.76s)]
*  we go back to HIV being deadly instead of a manageable disease. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=159.16s)]
*  It took us billions of dollars and decades to get here, but hey, let's throw it all in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  the trash bin day one. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=169.08s)]
*  That's what they announced. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  Hue and cry. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  Huge pushback. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=175.96s)]
*  And then they climbed down on that, too. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=177.52s)]
*  They've taken it back. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  No, didn't mean that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  Actually, the PEPFAR drugs, you can still keep administering those. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Just today, it's happening again. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=188.44000000000003s)]
*  This time it's at the NIH, National Institutes of Health. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=189.8s)]
*  They had ordered a full stop, no exceptions, to all clinical trials. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=192.56s)]
*  Literally, sick people in the middle of trials of experimental drugs. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=196.52s)]
*  Stop those trials immediately. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=201.0s)]
*  And no more research grants. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=203.48s)]
*  And no more review of research. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=205.0s)]
*  And no more releasing any scientific or health information, including information on the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=206.44s)]
*  fast-growing, very scary bird flu epidemic. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=210.6s)]
*  Stop it all. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=213.44s)]
*  And again, hue and cry. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=215.88s)]
*  Huge pushback. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=217.52s)]
*  Seriously, you're cutting off people with rare diseases and cancer in the middle of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=218.52s)]
*  their treatment? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=222.24s)]
*  Seriously? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=224.28s)]
*  Huge pushback. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=225.84s)]
*  Hue and cry. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=226.96s)]
*  And today, look, a climb down on much of what they had done at NIH. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Oops, never mind. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  Take it back. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=236.28s)]
*  That's not really what we meant. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=237.28s)]
*  And of course, the big one. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=241.52s)]
*  Yesterday, this bizarre two-page announcement from the Office of Management and Budget at [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=242.72s)]
*  the Trump White House demanding an immediate halt to basically everything the government [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=247.36s)]
*  funds. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=251.04000000000002s)]
*  Total chaos yesterday in all 50 states, as everything from firefighting to school lunches [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=252.84s)]
*  to Medicaid to preschool to meat inspections, everything all gets halted. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=257.88s)]
*  And so yesterday, as we covered here on the show last night, huge pushback. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=263.2s)]
*  Hue and cry. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=267.88s)]
*  And they started during the course of the day trying to take back individual parts of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=269.24s)]
*  the order. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=273.32s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=274.32s)]
*  We didn't mean the part that affects veterans. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=275.32s)]
*  No, we didn't mean Medicare. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=276.92s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=278.64s)]
*  We didn't mean the college loans and college grants paying your tuition. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=280.36s)]
*  No, you know, we didn't mean food stamps. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=284.2s)]
*  They tried to claw it back piece by piece by piece yesterday as the country rose up [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  in outrage over what they were doing. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=293.6s)]
*  Today, finally, they realized they had to take it all back. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=295.92s)]
*  Rescinded. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=299.76s)]
*  Didn't mean it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=302.32s)]
*  Not what we meant. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=303.76s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmkyJKb0G-I&t=304.76s)]
